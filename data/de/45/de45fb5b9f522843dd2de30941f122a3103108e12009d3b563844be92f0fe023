Great to hear that you are also working to make more use of the wealth of biodiversity (media) data that have been digitized over the last decades.\r\n\r\nI had a brief look at your tool. Looks great! Lots of optimizations with parallel retrieval. I was wondering, once your compile a media corpus, how would you cite this in a scientific publication? Also, how would a reader be able to reliably retrieve and verify the compiled media corpus?","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/comments/794082381/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/comments/794321411","html_url":"https://github.com/bio-guoda/preston/issues/63#issuecomment-794321411","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/63","id":794321411,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5NDMyMTQxMQ==","user":{"login":"faroit","id":72940,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyOTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/faroit","html_url":"https://github.com/faroit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/faroit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/faroit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/faroit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/faroit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/faroit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/faroit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/faroit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/faroit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/faroit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-09T19:08:35Z","updated_at":"2021-03-09T19:08:35Z","body":"@PietrH thanks for the pointer, i remember that I read about that limitation but then forgot","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/comments/794321411/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/comments/794328683","html_url":"https://github.com/bio-guoda/preston/issues/63#issuecomment-794328683","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/63","id":794328683,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5NDMyODY4Mw==","user":{"login":"faroit","id":72940,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyOTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/faroit","html_url":"https://github.com/faroit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/faroit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/faroit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/faroit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/faroit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/faroit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/faroit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/faroit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/faroit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/faroit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-09T19:14:52Z","updated_at":"2021-03-09T19:14:52Z","body":"> I was wondering, once your compile a media corpus, how would you cite this in a scientific publication?
