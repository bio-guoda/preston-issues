Botta’s Pocket Gophers are common in mountain meadows and tundra, sagebrush ( Artemisia , Asteraceae ) steppes, grasslands,forests, and suburban lawns and gardens. Similar to other pocket gophers, they appear to prefer deep soils in meadows and along rivers and streams, and they are common invadersof cultivated fields.","Diet of Botta’s Pocket Gopher consists of a wide variety of underground roots and tubers and a limited amount of surface vegetation. Nearly all species of plants in the vicinity of a burrow system are consumed, including annual and perennial monocots and dicots, perennial shrubs, cacti, and roots of a variety of tree species. Young shoots and entire seedlings of many plant species are pulled directly downward into a tunnel excavated beneath the plant. In many habitats, diet shifts seasonally, often in response to increased availabilities of forbs and grasses following spring rains. As in all other pocket gophers, the burrow system of Botta’s Pocket Gopher consists of a series of shallow feeding tunnels radiating spoke-like from a deeper, central network that contains one or more nest chambers and several smaller chambers for storage of food or fecal pellets. Many observations of aboveground foraging have been reported, almost always occurring within a few body lengths of a burrow entrance.","Breeding season varies greatly across the distribution of Botta’s Pocket Gopher; low-elevation individuals breed in early spring and high-elevation individuals in late spring following snow melt. Most populations are thoughtto breed only once per year, but when breeding season is long (January-April in certain low-elevation habitats in California), females born early in the season will breed later in the same season. Males do not attain reproductive maturity until the year after their birth. Some populations of Botta’s Pocket Gophers may breed in spring and autumn in years when food is abundant. In most years, nearly all adult females breed, but relatively few adult males breed, suggesting that male competition for access to femalesis high. Sex ratio of adults in most populationsis heavily skewed in favor of females, and this is especially true in populations with extreme sexual size dimorphism. Litter sizes of Botta’s Pocket Gophers are 1-10 young, averaging 4-5 young/litter. Nutrition and food abundance affect litter size, and studies by J. L. Patton and his colleagues showed that femalesliving in alfalfa fields in the southern California desert had larger litters than those living in nearby desert scrub habitats. Gestation is 18-21 days, and young are weaned and expelled from burrows at ¢.35 days of age. Young disperse on the surface in search of suitable habitat not already occupied by a competitor.","Botta’s Pocket Gopheris active at any hour of the day, with periods of peak activity around dawn and dusk. A study in southern California showed six individuals to be active an average of ¢.9 hours/day, with peak activity between 16:00 h and 20:00 h. Botta’s Pocket Gopher digs with its incisors and forelimbs, using hard enamel in the teeth to penetrate compact soils resistant to softer keratin in claws. In one study, growth rate of incisors averaged c.0-6 mm/day for the upper pair and almost 1 mm/day (36 cm/year) in the lower pair. Rate of claw growth varies widely butis usually slower than rate of incisor growth in species that dig with their teeth. Botta’s Pocket Gopher does not hibernate and is active year-round. Burrowing activity is low during hot, dry summers but increases dramatically with cooler temperatures and greater soil moisture in spring, autumn, and winter. Although most burrowing activity takes place in shallow feeding tunnels and is associated with foraging, individuals will also dig deep tunnels to avoid hot surface temperatures.",,Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red Last.,Baird (1855) | Hafner et al.

They appear to prefer deep soils in meadows and along rivers and streams, and they are common invaders of cultivated fields. An unknown number of Northern Pocket Gophers survived the explosive eruption of Mount St. Helens, Washington, in May 1980. Although these individuals were among the first mammals to occupy the devastated wastelands surrounding the volcano, adult survivorship in the year after the eruption was estimated at only 10%, a value much lower than the typical 18-70% survivorship measured in undisturbed populations of Northern Pocket Gophers in Utah.","Diet of the Northern Pocket Gopher consists of underground roots and tubers and a limited amount of surface vegetation. In Oregon, and probably throughout its distribution, the Northern Pocket Gopher will eat most succulent plants within its home range. Although in some habitats, plant species are consumed approximately in proportion to their abundance, one study showed that pocket gophers are able to select plants with higher levels of protein and fat. In Colorado, spring diet of a population of Northern Pocket Gophers living in short-grass prairie habitat was 67% forbs, 30% grasses, and 3% shrubs. In a subalpine habitat, also in Colorado, diet was 87% forbs, 12% roots, and 1% grasses. Feeding activities of Northern Pocket Gophers are similar to those of other species of pocket gophers and are believed to have contributed to the formation of Mima mounds throughout much of the USA west of the Mississippi River. In Colorado, adult Northern Pocket Gophers usually occupy Mima Mounds, but juveniles occupy interrmound areas. In areas with heavy snowpack, individuals tunnel in the snow and deposit excess soil in the tunnels. When snow melts in spring, these rope-like tubes of soil settle to the ground, leaving evidence of the individual’s winter activities.

Northern Bottlenose Whales appear to favor areas with complex seabed topography and are most commonly recorded in canyons along shelf margins, around oceanic islands, or around seamounts. Northern Bottlenose Whales may be yearround residents in some locations. In others, there is evidence of large-scale seasonal movements. In particular, a large number of individuals seem to move into the Norwegian Sea in early spring and summer and move out again in late summer and early autumn. Its not known where these individuals go, but seasonal patterns of strandings around the Faroe Islands, UK, and the Republic of Ireland suggest that they may move through the Faroe-Shetland channel and into the Atlantic Frontier region to the west of the British Isles. During these movements, it is not uncommon for some individual Northern Bottlenose Whales to stray into shallower shelf waters, where they may remain for extended periods of time before either leaving or stranding.","Primary prey of the Northern Bottlenose Whale throughout most of its distribution is the squid Gonatusfabricii, but they consume a wide range ofspecies of deep-water squid, and deep-water fish are not uncommon in the diet in some locations. They primarily consume a very narrow range of prey sizes. Most prey is 0-5-6% of an individual whale’s total body length. Prey capture is almost certainly achieved through suction feeding. Information from dive tags suggests that most foraging of Northern Bottlenose Whales occurs at or near the seabed and that they spend ¢.67% of theirlife at water depths greater than 1000 m. Individual dives are commonly longer than 30 minutes and may last more than an hour.","Northern Bottlenose Whales become sexually mature at a body length of ¢.600 cm for females and c.730 cm for males when they are 7-8 years old. Gestation lasts for ¢.12 months, and a single offspring is born at a length of ¢.300-350 cm. Weaning is thought to occur after one year, and there may be a minimum of two years between births.

It is the only species of beaked whales that commonly occurs in the Mediterranean Sea.,,"Deep, oceanic waters and generally in areas where water depths are more than 500 m. Cuvier’s Beaked Whales appearto favor areas with complex seabed topography and are most commonly recorded in canyons along the shelf margins, around oceanic islands, or around seamounts.","Cuvier’s Beaked Whales primarily prey on deep-water squid, but they may consume deep-water crustaceans in some parts of their distribution. They primarily consume a very narrow range of prey sizes, with most prey being 0-5-7% of an individual whale’s total body length, with a clear mode at 2-3%. Prey capture is almost certainly achieved by suction feeding. Information from dive tags suggests that most foraging of Cuvier’s Beaked Whales occurs at or near the seabed and that they spend ¢.67% oftheir life at water depths greater than 1000 m. Individual dives are commonly longer than 30 minutes and may last more than an hour.","Cuvier’'s Beaked Whales become sexually mature at a body length of ¢.580 cm for females and ¢.550 cm for males. Gestation lasts ¢.12 months, and a single offspring is born at a length of ¢.270 cm. Weaning is thought to occur after one year; there may be a minimum of two years between successive offspring for individual females. Nothing is known of their courtship behavior, but it appears that males engage In aggressive interactions, using their tusks, which results in high levels of scarring on the dorsal surface from the head to as far back as the dorsal fin.","There is no specific information available for this species, but the majority of their time is spent foraging at depths greater than 500 m.",,"CITES Appendix II.

For example, a population of ¢.80,000 individuals has been estimated for the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean and c.15,000 for the waters around Hawaii. This would suggest that Cuvier’s Beaked Whale is one of the most abundant species of beaked whale in these regions. It has been taken in small numbers by whalersin several parts of the world, including Japan, but has never been the target of a full-scale commercial fishery. It is one of the main species that has been affected by mass strandings associated with the use of mid-frequency military sonars, which may have conservation implications for local populations. Cuvier’s Beaked Whales may also be affected by overfishing of deep-water ecosystems. They occasionally occur as bycatch in driftnet fisheries. Plastic debris is commonly recorded in the stomachs of Cuvier’s Beaked Whales. In some parts of the world, such as the north-eastern Atlantic Ocean,as many as 80% of individuals contain plastic debris at the time of death. This plastic can cause erosion to the stomach lining and has been implicated in the deaths of several individuals. Nevertheless, effects of these impacts on oceanic species are difficult to study and quantify, and it is not currently known how great a threat they are to Cuvier’s Beaked Whales as a whole or to individual populations or subpopulations.",Baird et al.

Such grasslands, dominated by Narenga porphyrocoma, Saccharum spontaneum, S. bengalensis, Imperata cylindrica, and Themeda villosa, form characteristic associations 2-3 m in height. However, most such early successional communities are subject to wide-scale annual burning and accordingly are characterized by low diversity and the overwhelming preponderance of a few, fire-resistant grasses. Therefore they almost certainly constitute suboptimal habitats for Pygmy Hogs and most other grassland dependent species, which are deprived of cover and other resources for protracted periods prior to the early season rains. The species is not found in structurally similar grasslands located in riverine floodplains, which are subject to prolonged inundations during the monsoon. These grasslands are generally fertile alluvial areas, making them desirable for agriculture. Human use of these habitats contributes to the rapid decline of Pygmy Hogs throughout their known or presumed former range.","Pygmy Hogs feed on roots, tubers, shoots, and ground vegetation, along with worms and other invertebrates and, probably, small vertebrates (e.g. reptiles and the eggs and nestlings of ground-nesting birds).","Reproduction is strongly seasonal, with almost all births occurring during a single, well-defined birth peak, which coincides with the onset of the monsoon,in late April and May in western Assam . Litter size varies from two to six, but is usually 3-4. The species is unusual among the suids in that nests are constructed and used by both sexes at all times of the year and nest building is not limited to farrowing.","The species seems to be most active during the day, although this remains poorly studied. A study of diurnal activity patterns in captive animals revealed that the highest proportion of observation time was dedicated to foraging and moving, followed by being inside the nest, resting, displaying, and allogrooming. The two sexes partitioned their time rather differently. Females seemed to spend more time on foraging than males, while males moved more than females, which was associated with elevated levels of display behavior and courtship performed by them. Display was exhibited only by males and performed during the breeding season. Allogrooming was the most prominent social interaction observed, with certain individuals grooming more than others. Moreover, among the breeding pairs, males groomed considerably more than females. It is possible that male Pygmy Hogs move a lot and display considerably to increase their potential reproductive success. Because these observations were on captive animals it is not clear how these time budgets would be changed under natural conditions, where the presence of predators and other factors would likely change their behavior.",,"CITES Appendix I. Classified as Critically Endangered on The IUCN Red List, putting the species among the most endangered of all mammals. It is also listed in Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. Historically Pygmy Hogs were known from only a few locations in northern West Bengal and north-western Assam in India . The species is now believed likely to have occurred in an area of tall alluvial grasslands that extended in a narrow belt south of the Himalayan foothills from north-western Uttar Pradesh and southern Nepal to Assam, possibly extending at intervals into contiguous habitats in southern Bhutan . Records are scarce because the species was seldom observed in the wild state, on account of the former inaccessibility ofits habitat, to which these animals are supremely adapted by virtue of their diminutive body size and other characters. After at least two decades without reported sightings the species was feared extinct. However, in 1971 it was coincidentally “rediscovered” in two separate locations in north-western Assam, Barnadi Wildlife Sanctuary in Darrang District and Manas National Park. Subsequent field surveys confirmed its continued occurrence in several other forest reserves in north-western Assam in the late 1970s, but continued commercial forestry operations resulted in its extirpation in all of these areas by the early 1980s and in Barnadi by the late 1980s/ early 1990s, despite the latter area having been upgraded to a wildlife sanctuary to try to protect it. Extensive surveys of grasslands in other parts of its known or presumed former range in other north-eastern Indian states and neighboring parts of southern Nepal and Bhutan during the 1980s and early 1990s also failed to locate any surviving populations. These findings substantiated growing concerns that the species had been reduced to only a few disparate locations in and around Manas National Park, all of which were subject to deliberate dry-season burning and other disturbances. To make matters worse, north-western Assam was also beset by local socio-political turmoils that spilled over into Manas in the early 1990s. Commercial poachers promptly decimated key populations of Greater One-horned Rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis), Barasingha (Rucervus duvaucelii ranjitsinhi), and other species. Fortunately, Pygmy Hogs were either too small or too difficult to catch to be similarly targeted, though the species nonetheless remains severely threatened throughout its last remaining range, even in Manas, because of degradation of its habitat via profligate levels of dry-season burning, risk of disease through increased incursions by domestic livestock and other factors. The main threats to survival of Pygmy Hog are loss and degradation of habitat due to human settlements, agricultural encroachments, flood control schemes, and traditional forestry management practices. Some management practices, such as planting of trees in the grasslands and indiscriminate use offire to create openings and to promote fresh growth of grass, have caused extensive damage to the habitats the authorities intend to protect. In fact, large scale burning of grass in the dry season remains the single most important threat to the continuing survival of these animals, though the reduction and fragmentation of their habitat and other anthropogenic disturbances also bring increased risks of contagious disease via contact with domestic livestock and other factors. A “Conservation Action Plan for the Pygmy Hog,” originally prepared by the ITUCN/SSC Pigs and Peccaries Specialist Group and the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust, and submitted and agreed upon in principle by both the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests and the Assam State Government, in 1981, was finally and formally approved in 1995. This agreement enables the implementation of various field studies, follow-up status surveys, education and awareness campaigns, personnel training, and local community assistance projects. A highly successful conservation breeding program was also initiated in 1996, following the construction of the “Pygmy Hog Conservation Research and Breeding Centre” located on the outskirts of the Assam State capital, Guwahati, and the capture of two male and four female Pgymy Hogs in Manas. This capture operation, undertaken in close collaboration with Park officials, was timed to coincide with the expected mid-term pregnancy of the adult sows, to increase the number of genetically represented individuals (i.e. wild sows that had been impregnated by other wild males) and therebytriple the number of captive individuals within six weeks. (Three of the four sows produced a total of thirteen infants, all but one of which survived.) Subsequent breeding soon resulted in over crowding and a need to manage the numbers and identities of individuals producing litters each year. A custom-built “pre-release” facility located at Potosali, close to Nameri National Park in north-west Assam, was built, with several large enclosures with habitats where animals scheduled for reintroduction into selected protected sites learned to forage for themselves. The first releases took place in the Sonai Rupai Wildlife Sanctuary, and the first wild births were recorded the following year. More releases were conducted in 2009 and 2010, and several additionalsites have been identified for similar reintroduction efforts in the coming years.",Bell & Oliver (1992) | Deb (1995) | Funk et al.

The species has seldom been bred in captivity, though a litter of five piglets was reported on one occasion.","Little is known of the species’ circadian activity in remoter areas, but it is reported to be essentially nocturnal in areas subject to human disturbance.",,"Classified as Vulnerable on The IUCN Red List because it is currently undergoing a drastic population decline, estimated to be more than 30% over a period of three generations, or about 21 years. This decline is inferred from the apparent disappearance of several populations and the effects of overhunting, habitat loss, and hybridization. S. philippensis is endemic to the Philippines , and occurs through most of the country except the Palawan Faunal Region (whereitis replaced by the Palawan Bearded Pig, S. ahoenobarbus), Mindoro (replaced by the Mindoro Warty Pig, S. oliveri), the Negros-Panay Faunal Region (replaced by the Visayan Warty Pig, S. cebifrons), and the Sulu Faunal Region (where it is apparently replaced by a closely related but as yet undescribed species of pig). Subspecies philippensis is confined to the “Greater Luzon Faunal Region.” Subspecies mindanensis is confined to the “Greater Mindanao Faunal Region.” Precise data on wild pig populations is lacking for most of these islands, particularly the smaller ones. The present status of S. philippensis may be inferred from the extent of remaining forest overits known ranges, the likely extent of hunting pressure, and other factors. The species was undoubtedly far more extensively distributed in the past, and most extant populations, particularly on the largerislands, are badly fragmented and declining. The species’ habitat is threatened by continued low-level illegal logging and agricultural expansion. Pig hunting continues throughout the remaining range of the species, including many (perhaps most) protected areas. Hunting is mostly practiced by local farmers and indigenous peoples in hinterland communities and by recreational hunters from cities. Both of these groups also sell any surplus meat, which usually commands at least twice the price of domestic pork in local markets and speciality restaurants. Efforts to reduce or discourage hunting are often compromised by generally negative attitudes towards these animals, which can cause severe damage to crops planted within or close to existing forest boundaries, and which are therefore regarded as pests. Unfortunately, this species is also threatened by genetic contamination via hybridization with free-ranging domestic and feral animals. Incidences of such hybridizations have been confirmed from Luzon and Mindanao, and reported from Basilan and other islands.",Cruzana et al.

Small numbers of these animals are also known to persist in some degraded habitats, such as Imperata cylindrica grasslands, as long as there are areas of dense cover, but there is evidence that some and perhaps most of these individuals are either feral domestic pigs or hybrids between S. cebifrons and free-ranging domestic pigs introduced by farmers in hinterland communities. In captivity, Visayan Warty Pigs readily bathe in open pools and use mud wallows, and it is assumed that the animals also do this in the wild state.","The Visayan Warty Pig is omnivorous, feeding on a range of plant and animal species. Because of the species’ scarcity in the wild there are no direct reports of feeding behavior, but some information has been obtained from scats and feeding signs. The species appears to feed on plant species such as Lithocarpus ( Fagaceae ), Platea excelsa (Icainaceae), and Dillenia reifferscheidia ( Dilleniaceae ), with the former two species possibly being completely dependent on S. cebifrons for the dispersal of their seeds. The species also appears to feed on a range of vines, palms, wild bananas, and agricultural crops such as taro and avocados, as well as earthworms. Captive animals will readily consume a wide variety of cereals, fruits, vegetables, leafy branches, and grass, and most individuals will avidly consume rodents (rats and mice) and other prey items.","The breeding behavior of S. cebifrons is primarily known from captive populations. The gestation period is about 118 days. One or two weeks prior to giving birth, females begin showing nesting behavior and may become aggressive to conspecifics. Females usually give birth overnight, and are very protective of their offspring. Litter size in the wild is between two and four, which is similar to those in captivity. A record number of five offspring in a litter was observed in two Philippine breeding centers in 2005; the piglets had to be weaned earlier than usual to help the female regain condition. Juvenile animals begin tasting solid food at one week of age and may be weaned by six months. Females are capable of producing a litter every 8-12 months. Females reach sexual maturity at an age of 2-3 years. Males may be sexually mature at two years, but do not possess the fully developed characteristics of adult males. Captive Visayan Warty Pigs can live up to 18 years.","Little has been reported about the activity patterns of S. cebifrons in undisturbed areas, because these areas are so remote and the terrain so rugged as to make even chance observations unlikely. In more accessible areas, where the species is heavily hunted, the animals avoid human activity (but may raid agricultural crops planted within or close to forest edges) and are mainly active at night.",,"Classified as Critically Endangered on The IUCN Red List. S. cebifrons is endemic to the West Visayas Islands of the central Philippines , where it is known or presumed to have occurred on all six main islands: Cebu , Negros, Guimaras , Panay, Masbate , and Ticao. Fragmented populations survive today on the islands of Negros and Panay. The species maystill occur on Masbate Island, although no confirmed sightings have been made since 1993; it was last reported on Cebu in the 1960s. It is extinct on Guimaras and Ticao. It is not known whether it or S. philippensis formerly occurred on the neighboring island of Siquijor , where wild pigs have been extirpated. S. cebifrons has been replaced by S. philippensis on Bohol and all other larger Philippine Islands east of Huxley’s Line except Mindoro, where it has been replaced by S. oliveri. It is thought to be extinct in over 98% of its former range and is now found only in small, fragmented populations. Besides the loss of suitable forest habitat, the species is highly threatened by hunting for food and to reduce crop raiding. Hybridization is another threat, there being recent evidence that warty pigs have bred with domestic pigs. This is obvious in animals killed by poachers, which with increasing frequency show evidence of hybridization, including shortened snouts, large ears, reduced manes, stockier bodies, and even piebald markings. In response to increasing evidence ofits critically threatened conservation status, in 1993 the IUCN/SSC Pigs, Peccaries and Hippos Specialist Group and other supporting partner agencies, including the Zoological Society of San Diego and the Rotterdam Zoo, devised and initiated a Visayan Warty Pig Conservation Programme under the auspices of a Memorandum of Agreement with the Philippine Government's Department of Environment & Natural Resources (DENR). Priority activities identified and implemented under the auspices of this agreement included various follow-up field status and ethnobiological surveys, education and awareness campaigns, development of new protected areas, and the establishment of properly structured conservation breeding programs. These include the development of scientifically managed wildlife rescue and breeding centers on Negros and Panay Islands and similar species recovery programs for a variety of other threatened taxa endemic to the West Visayas (e.g. the Visayan Spotted Deer, Rusa alfredi, and rufous-headed hornbill, Aceros waldeni). This was done partly with a view to reintroductions of these species, but also as a means of opportunistically acquiring sufficient numbers of founder individuals, by rescuing animals illegally caught in snares, confiscating live individuals offered for sale in local meat markets, and prevailing upon local owners to donate individuals they had acquired as pets from similar sources. In the case of the Visayan Warty Pig, there was also an urgent need to ensure the survival of pure-bred animals while the opportunity still existed to do so. Every attempt has been made to determine the precise origin and likely genetic purity of any such founder individuals, to ensure the likely purity of the separate stocks of these animals from Negros and Panay. This action was since vindicated by new evidence of important genetic differences between the Negros and Panay populations. First and second generation captive-bred animals from both islands have also been exported on breeding loans from the Philippine Government to the San Diego and Rotterdam Z00s, and are now being cooperatively managed in a number of approved breeding centers in the USA and Europe.",Cummings (2003) | De Leon et al.

In Europe, the species occurs in agricultural landscapes, as well as riverine and mountainous forests, where it reachesits highest densities in oak-dominated forests. In South-east Asia, S. scrofa is found in mature forests, secondary forests, gardens, and plantations. It can reach very high densities in dipterocarp forests during times of mastfruiting. S. scrofa can cause considerable damage to agriculturalfields. The animals generally avoid open fields but do enter them readily when crops are taller and thus provide cover.","S. scrofa is a typical omnivorous species. They eat almost anything they come across, including grass, nuts, berries, carrion, roots, tubers, refuse, insects, and small reptiles. They are also known to prey on young deer and lambs, and, in India , have been observed to prey on Chital (Axis axis) and to forcibly appropriate fresh kills from Leopards (Panthera pardus). Vertebrate prey may constitute an important part of the species’ diet in some areas, though studies in Spain revealed that prey items (mostly birds and crayfish) made up only 4% of their diets. Snails and terrestrial arthropods were frequently found but take up less volume. The species causes considerable damage to croplands, with damage to permanent grassland more frequent and more severe than damage to annual crops. S. scrofa is preyed on by a range of species, including Gray Wolves (Canis lupus), Dholes (Cuon alpinus), Tigers (FP. tigris), Leopards, Eurasian Lynxes (Lynx lynx) and some larger reptiles, such as crocodiles and pythons (Python spp.).","S. scrofa has a gestation period of 112-130 days. Litters of 5-9 are most common, although both smaller and larger do occur. Piglets weigh 750-1000 g at birth. Just prior to giving birth, the sows leave their social groups and construct well-developed nests in which to give birth, or farrow, a process usually lasting 2-3 hours. The sow and piglets remain in, or close to, the nest for 4-6 days before rejoining their natal family groups, after which piglets will suckle other lactating sows in the group. Young are weaned at 3-4 months, and they will begin to eat solid foods, such as worms and grubs, after about two weeks. The young usually reach sexual maturity at 18 months. Breeding occurs year-round in the tropics, although in more temperate zones the young are born primarily in the spring. In the Ukraine , about 80% of S. scrofa females reproduce annually. Their fertility rate is 7-21+ 0-26 piglets, but during the first year of their life more than 50% of the piglets die. Animals can live over 20 years in the wild, but populations are dominated by younger animals. For example, a Eurasian wild steppe population comprised 58:6% juveniles (the first year oflife), 14-3% yearlings (the second year), 11:5% adult males, and 15-6% adult females. If surprised or cornered, a boar (and particularly a sow with her piglets) can and will defend itself and its young with intense vigor. The male lowers its head, charges, and then slashes upward with his tusks. The female, whose tusks are notvisible, charges with her head up, mouth wide, and bites.","Activity of S. scrofa varies geographically but seems to be concentrated between dusk and dawn, and especially between 20:00 h and 24:00 h and around 05:00 h, with a primary resting period at night and a briefer rest during the early afternoon. In areas with high hunting pressure, a shift to nearly exclusive nocturnal activity has been observed. S. scrofa rests in tight groups with bodily contact. The resting places, used several times before being abandoned, are made of troughs lined with leaves and branches. Wallowing is a favorite activity. After wallowing, the Eurasian Wild Pig rubs against trees and bushes, an activity that serves as a territorial marker.",,"Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List, except for the subspecies riukiuanus, which has sometimes been listed separately as Vulnerable. The species is abundant in many parts of its range, though populations have been severely reduced and fragmented in places where hunting intensity is high (for example, in eastern and south-eastern Asia). Although there is no global population estimate, numbers can be high in many places. At a global level, there are no major threats to the species. However, there are many threats at a more local level, principally habitat destruction and hunting pressure, either for food, sport, or in reprisal for crop damage. In some places, genetic contamination through interbreeding with free-ranging domesticated or feral pigs is also a threat. Areas of special concern include the Ryukyu Islands, south Japan , where the endemic subspecies riukiuanus is internationally recognized as being seriously threatened throughout its extremely restricted and discontinuous range. It is ostensibly protected by the Japanese Government as a national monument. Nonetheless, it is widely hunted for sport and in reprisal for crop damage, and local governmental authorities even pay bounties to farmers for these animals. In various places in Indonesia , most notably in Java , attempts have been made in the past to eradicate wild pigs altogether by means of organized shooting parties and poisoning campaigns. However, despite many thousands of wild pigs being destroyed in this way,it is clear that this has had little lasting effect on these animals. Wild pigs are also susceptible to a variety of highly contagious diseases that can decimate their populations. Such catastrophic crashes were reported from Sri Lanka in 1989 due to swine fever, Honshu Island, Japan in 1877, possibly because of hog cholera, and the Iriomote Islands between 1976 and 1980, caused by severe skin disease tentatively identified as sarcoptic mange. The traditional practice of rearing “domestic” pigs in semi-wild conditions has resulted in their hybridizing with the wild populations. Although introduced feral pigs are almost invariably regarded as major pests, some seemingly “ancient” breeds are of particular scientific interest and/or socio-economic importance to local peoples. Most prominent among these are the diminutive wild pigs of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands .The Andaman Island suids include the world’s smallest freeranging wild pigs (with the exception of Pygmy Hogs, Porcula salvania), which occur in two distinct “long-snouted” and “short-snouted” morphotypes, and which constitute one of the most important food resources for the few remaining indigenous Onge, Jarawa, and Sentinilese tribal societies. Whilst the Andamanese tribals are traditionally hunter-gatherers, dependent on the continued hunting of the wild pigs and other species, both wild and domestic pigs are of the greatest cultural importance to the Shompen tribal people of the Nicobar Islands , who not only domesticate pigs in large numbers, but have evolved one of the most complex “human-pig” cultures found anywhere in the in the world. A similar situation exists in eastern Indonesia , Papua , and a range Micronesian and Macronesian islands, where domesticated S. scrofa (as well as domesticated S. celebensis ) play a very important cultural role.",Acevedo et al.

The reasons for this are not known, but it might be because the pigs are unable to tolerate low temperatures. They evidently prefer secondary or disturbed forests, though they are also often found near the coasts in remnant patches of mangrove and swamp forest. They are rare in the few remaining lowland primary forests and in areas with high human populations where otherwise suitable habitat is fragmented and surrounded by agricultural land. However, they do feed on crops, making nocturnal raids on fields of corn and cassava. As with S. scrofa , the species is widely persecuted for such depredations. The two species appear to avoid each other. In the 1920s, their abundance was thought to be similar, but only one species was generally found in a given location. S. scrofa appeared to be better adapted to agricultural areas and heavily degraded forests, and S. verrucosus more restricted to woodlands.","Ecological information about S. verrucosus is rare because when the species wasstill relatively common, extensive descriptions of feeding and breeding ecology did not differentiate between S. verrucosus and S. scrofa . One account from 1928 describes their ecological similarities: both species feed on a range of animal and plant foods, including fallen fruits, roots, worms, and insects. They are particularly partial to ripe rice, making them a feared agricultural pest.","The gestation period is thought to be about four months, and 3-9 young are born. Most births reportedly occur in the rainy season, from January to March, in a large nest made by the female out ofleaflitter. According to a recent informant, females with young are mostly seen between August and December.","There is little known about activity patterns of S. verrucosus. Interview surveys on Java in 2003 suggest that the species is mostly nocturnal, with several respondents reporting that damage to rice fields almost exclusively happened at night. It could be that a shift from generally diurnal activity patterns in pigs to nocturnal ones is because of the very high hunting pressure on the species.",,"Classified as Endangered on The IUCN Red List. It is now restricted to several isolated areas on mainlandJava. The Javan Warty Pig is endemic to the islands ofJava, Madura, and Bawean in Indonesia . It occurs alongside S. scrofa vittatus, but it appears that the two species avoid each other and attain their highest densities where the other speciesis absent. S. verrucosus was widespread on Java as recently as 1982, but is now absent from most of the island and survives only in highly fragmented populations. A Java-wide, interview-based survey in 2003 found that there were about ten areas on Java and Bawean where S. verrucosus populations survived, although other small groups may have existed elsewhere. These include remnant and low density populations in west Java in the areas between Malingping and Rangkasbitung, and between Sukabumi and the coastal nature reserves of Cikepuh. S. verrucosus is very rare near Purwakarta. Several small populations remain near and south of Garut, with a few reported sightings of S. verrucosus in 2002 and just before. Around Majalengka and towards Sumedang, interviewees reported recent killings of S. verrucosus, but the species is now much rarer than in the past. A population of S. verrucosus still remains east of Tasikmalaya towards Ciamis, although people consider S. verrucosus to be rare in comparison to S. scrofa . Several interviewees reported recent sightings of S. verrucosus from the area around Cilacap, Cipatujuh, and Nusa Kembangan, including some from the Nusa Kembangan Nature Reserve off Cilacap, but the species seems to be rare and fragmented into small populations. The only areas where S. verrucosus reportedly remained common were around Subah, where animals were generally seen in small groups of 1-2 individuals and groups of 4-6 during the mating season, and around Blora and Bojonegoro. In the latter area, group size had reportedly declined from 10-20 to only 1-3. No recent records of S. verrucosus exist from Madura Island, and the species is considered extirpated there. On Bawean Island, the only area where the subspecies blouchi occurs, the species is now very rare, and possibly already extirpated. There are no estimates of overall population size, but the species has shown a rapid population decline in recent decades. Compared to a survey conducted in 1982, 17 of the 32 populations (53%) are extirpated or have dropped to low encounter rate levels. [tis thought that the population decline observed in this species is primarily caused by a decline in suitable habitat, especially of stands of teak forest or similar forest plantations, and by high hunting pressure. These animals are killed both by sport hunters and by farmers protecting their crops. Many animals are killed by poisoning. As yet unpublished reports of the recent dramatic reduction in numbers, possibly resulting in the extirpation of subspecies blouchi on Bawean Island have been attributed to correspondingly increased hunting pressure following the recent settlement of Christian immigrants from Sumatra ; these animals were previously left largely unharmed by the predominantly Muslim inhabitants. Competition from and hybridization with the Eurasian Wild Pig (S. scrofa ) has been speculated as a further threat to S. verrucosus, especially in areas where human-induced habitat changes favor S. scrofa . Recent DNA analysis of one S. verrucosus specimen suggested high levels of inbreeding in the species compared to other Sus species , but no evidence of introgression from S. scrofa was found. Further genetic studies on more samples are needed to assess potential conservation implications of both inbreeding and hybridization.",Bartels (1937 | 1940 | 1942) | Blouch (1983 | 1988 | 1993) | Blouch & Groves (1990) | Franck (1936) | Groves (1981) | Hardjasamita (1987) | Huffman (2004) | Nijman (2001 | 2003) | Olivier (1925 | 1928) | Semiadi & Meijaard (2004 | 2006) | Semiadi et al.

It is found at elevations up to moss forest at about 2300 m , but it prefers valleys.","Little is known about the feeding behavior of S. celebensis . Roots, fallen fruit, leaves, and young shoots are thought to constitute the bulk of their diet, with invertebrates, small vertebrates, and carrion as occasional secondary additions. However, no quantitative data are available about percentages of these itemsin their diets, and how this varies over time and in different habitats. Unlike babirusas, S. celebensis has been observed to consume grasses, although this is based on brief observations only.","Mating is reported to occur in February, although this is based on only one observation. Births can occur at any time throughout the year but sows usually have their young in April or May. Gestation length is not known for certain, and the suggestion that it may be between 16 and 20 weeks should be treated with caution. Farrowing sows give birth in nests made of grasses, leaves, branches, and twigs piled over a shallow excavation approximately 2 m in length. Litter size has been estimated as 2-8 piglets, with an average offive, although a study in North Sulawesi in 1991 found six pregnant sows killed by hunters to be carrying only 1-3 fetuses, with a mean of only 2-17 fetuses per pregnancy.","The Sulawesi Warty Pig is primarily diurnal. Most feeding activity observed in relatively undisturbed areas occurs during the daylight hours, concentrated in the early morning and late afternoon.",,"Classified as Near Threatened on The IUCN Red List based on the level of the main threats, habitat loss and hunting. S. celebensis is a species of the central and eastern islands of Indonesia , occurring east of Wallace's Line, which separates the faunas and floras with Oriental affiliation in the west from the Australasian ones in the east. Generally the species is considered to be common, although statements along these lines have been repeated for decades without actual field surveys providing supporting information. S. celebensis has a patchy distribution on most of Sulawesi Island; it is most common in the south-eastern parts of the island. The species has been considered scarce in south-west Sulawesi for over two decades because of ongoing deforestation and hunting. Decreasing sign of pigs in various parts of southern Sulawesi was noted as early as 1938. Extensive logging and conversion of land for agriculture, coupled with human population expansion and immigration, have resulted in the marked contraction and fragmentation ofits range in most places. Market surveys also indicate that the species is under high hunting pressure. For example, brief surveys of three village markets in north-eastern Sulawesi concluded that about 2-20 wild pigs per week were being sold by commercial hunters and slaughtered by butchers when needed. Wild piglets that are caught by villagers in Sulawesi are kept and usually raised for slaughter for eating or sold at the local market. The high volume of trade in this species raises concerns about the sustainability of the current harvesting rate. The fact that the species is not protected outside certain protected areas, and can therefore be openly hunted and traded, makesit difficult to reduce consumption to more sustainable levels. Surveys within protected areas also show that the species is commonly hunted there, and in three protected areas in north Sulawesi no sign at all was found of S. celebensis . It is clear that there are few if any areas where the species can be considered secure. S. celebensis is of particular interest in that it is the only pig species, apart from S. scrofa that has been domesticated and quite widely transported by human agency outsideits original range. The available evidence indicates that it is still maintained as a domestic in some areas, but its commercial importance and future potential as a genetic resource are unknown.",Alvard (2000) | Bosma et al.

This tree family is often dominant in lowland and hill forests, and is characterized by synchronized flowering and mast-fruiting. Bearded Pigs also make extensive use of riverbanks, where they root among herbs and look for earthworms. Other habitats they use include estuarine swamps, secondary and all kinds of oldjungle, beaches, all kinds of plantations, clearings, and also the outskirts of towns. The species is well known forits migratory behavior. Bearded Pigs are scattered across large regions during non-mast fruiting times, but move from both mountain and swamp habitats to drier lowland forests when fruit becomes abundant.","Bearded Pigs are real omnivores and it has been said that “it is almost easier to state what they will not eat.” They feed on a long list of food plants, but also consume roots, fungi, invertebrates in soil and rotting wood, small vertebrates, turtle eggs, and carrion. Fruit supply is believed to have particular influence in determining growth rate, fat deposition, and reproduction. The other foods that normally occur in the forest are assumed to allow only slow growth at best. The oil-rich seeds of members of the tree families Fagaceae and Dipterocarpaceae are thought to be especially important. During mast fruiting the majority of seeds in the diet are dipterocarps, although they can and will eat other species. Oaks, especially Castinopsis spp., Lithocarpus spp. , and Quercus spp. , are also favorites. During fruiting times, they are almost solely seed predators, and Bearded Pigs play an important role in the distribution of seeds. They also consume a few figs (e.g. Ficus dubia), melastomes, and other tiny, hard testas, which can pass through their guts and germinate.","Age at first pregnancy varies in the wild from about 10 to 20 months. The rut appears to coincide with synchronized flowering in the forest, occuring during the transition between late flowering and early fruit formation. Falling petals therefore offer observers a potential visual cue. During the onset of droughts and related flowering of dipterocarps, male Bearded Pigs rut and females construct nests. In big fruiting years, Bearded Pigs can “double-clutch.” This suggests that a certain nutritional status may have to be attained by females before they are receptive to mating. Pregnant females had a median fatness index (finger-widths of fat depth at the shoulder) of 1-5, whereas rutting males scored zero on this measure (n = 19). Gestation length is estimated at 90-120 days, based on the interval between rut and the ensuing birth-peak. Births occur in a nest, which is constructed of vegetation by the mother, and which is occupied by her and the new piglets for a week or so. Data from hunter interviews indicated that the median number of piglets accompanying an adult female was seven (n = 53), which was the same as the median number of fetuses counted in dead females (n = 8). Litter size is, however, very variable in part because of the influence of female size; small mothers typically have 3—4 piglets in a litter and large ones have 10-12.","Bearded Pigs are mostly diurnal. They are subject to irregular migrations, seeming to follow fruit when in season so that one year a particular spot may swarm with them but not be troubled again for many years after. The ripening of illipe nuts ( Shorea sp. ) in Sarawak and East Kalimantan appears to be significantly correlated with pig migrations. These mass migrations of Bearded Pigs are distinct from annual local movements damaging rice fields. The somewhat forced, lemminglike aspects of these large scale pig migrations are exemplified by the observation of a pig whose hindquarters were paralyzed and which pulled itself forward byits front legs to follow its conspecifics. The appearance of large numbers of pigs traveling together is especially obvious during river crossings, which they do in groups of over 100 animals. This provides local hunters with the opportunity to kill large numbers of pigs for meat and fat, from which they extract oils. Mass river crossings might have evolved at a time when crocodiles were still abundant in the region. Bearded Pigs appear to exist in different population states, which have been summarized as follows. 1) Dispersed,static populations exploiting small, dispersed, unpredictable and discontinuous “background” food sources. Low breeding and growth rates possible. Local movements only. Example: typical mixed dipterocarp forest in Borneo between generalized fruiting episodes. 2) Small to medium populations exploiting concentrated, predictable and continuous “target” food sources. High breeding and growth rates possible. Local movement only. Example: Koompassia-Burseraceae forest in Peninsular Malaysia . 3) Small to medium populations, with members aggregating to exploit large, dispersed, unpredictable food sources. Breeding and birth rates depend on success of matching movements to fruiting within a dynamic mosaic of fruit production. Short to medium-range movements. Example: typical mixed dipterocarp forest in Borneo between generalized fruiting episodes. 4) Small to large populations moving regularly to exploit concentrated, predictable, and discontinuous target food sources. Breeding and growth linked to activity of food sources. Short-range to long-range movements. Size of population varies from year to year depending on background food supply. Examples: Dryobalanops aromatica association in Peninsular Malaysia ; Dinochloa association in Sabah . 5) Large and expanding population exploiting an exceptional supply of background food available over a period sufficient for severallitters to be raised to sexual maturity. High breeding and growth rates characteristic. Long range movements. Example: interior of Sarawak in 1954, 1959, 1983 and 1987. 6) Very large and collapsing population having exceeded background food supply. Low breeding and high death rates. Increasingly desperate long-range movements. Example: starving herds reported from Malaya and Borneo. It remains largely unstudied how these different population states have been affected by the continuing loss, degradation, and fragmentation of forest habitats. Unconfirmed information from local people in Kalimantan and Sarawak suggests that mass migrations of pigs no longer occur to the same extent as reported formerly, even as recently as the 1980s and early 1990s, which might indicate that with the removal of millions of hectares of high timber value dipterocarp forests food dynamics and related population states have been severely disrupted.",,"Classified as Vulnerable on The IUCN Red List, mostly because of the rapid loss of its forest habitat and high hunting pressure throughoutits range. The Bearded Pig occurs in Peninsular Malaysia , Sumatra, and on Borneo. It is also reported from the island of Sibutu, west of the Sulu Archipelago in the Philippines , and possibly on Tawi Tawi Island. In Peninsular Malaysia and Sumatra its distribution is now limited to a relatively small part ofits presumed prehistoric range. In Borneo the species is still widespread but likely declining. There are additional records from a range of smaller islands, where the status of the speciesis unclear but populations have possibly been extirpated. This includes the islands of Balembangan, Banggi, Batam, Bauwal, Bintan, Bruit, Bunju, Burung, Durian Besar, Galang, Jambongan, Juanata, Karimata, Kundur, Lamukotan, Laut, Malawali, Mapor, Miang Besar, Molleangen, Panebangan, Pelapis, Ransang, Rempang, Rupat, Sauh, Sebuku, Sibutu, Tarakan, Tebing Tinggi, and Ungar. Humans have lived in Borneo for at least 40,000 years and have been hunting mammals such as Bearded Pigs for at least 35,000 years. Holocene and prehistoric cave finds in Sabah , Sarawak , and East Kalimantan indicate that Bearded Pigs have been the most commonly hunted Bornean mammal for at least the last 15,000 years. The archaeological evidence suggests that the Bearded Pig was hunted but was apparently fairly plentiful and widespread in the Malaysian Peninsula and Sumatra about 1500-2000 years ago. Overhunting has since led to population declines. In some parts of Malaysia , Sumatra, and Borneo, Bearded Pigs had already been hunted to near extinction by the 1920s. More recently, the threat of extinction is becoming a reality in many more parts of their range, where overhunting, logging, and conversion of forests have caused a rapid decline in Bearded Pig populations. Overhunting has also likely led to the extermination of many small-island populations. In 1906, such extinctions were reported for the Penata and Kebun Islands in the Burung group of northern West Kalimantan, and presumably extinctions have also occurred in the often densely settled islands where Bearded Pigs used to occur. It has been estimated that hunters in Sarawak take an annual harvest of up to one million or more pigs, making wild pork meat of considerable economic significance. This is quite often related to commercial timber extraction. One typical logging camp in Sarawak killed as many as 880 pigs per year, mainly for food. Hunting in these camps was found to be wasteful, with pigs being killed on sight even if the worker did not need the meat. In one logging area, for example, during a pig migration, people would kill an animal, take only the prime cuts of meat, leave the rest to rot, and kill another animal the next day. Bearded Pigs are by far the most preferred species of wild meat throughout Sarawak and Sabah , where they comprise as much as 72% of the dressed weight of all animals hunted. In these areas, the impact of hunting seems clear, with a significant correlation between hunting pressure and animal density. This pattern is so strong that hunting pressure overrides the large effects of habitat variables and is the single main determinant of animal density in an area. As hunting pressure increases, the density of all animal groups investigated, including Bearded Pigs, decreases, until all large animals are locally extirpated. This pattern of high hunting pressure on these animals is also found among Penan and Kenyah tribes in East Kalimantan, where pigs contributed 79-8% of all catches and 91% ofall the edible meat. On average these people consume of 133-6 kg of pig meat per person per year. The estimate for Sarawak is 12 kg of pig meat per person per year. In Peninsular Malaysia , the more sedentary population of Bearded Pigs, apparently associated with continuously fruiting Koompassia-Burseraceae forests, is endangered by hunting as well as habitat destruction. The habitat changes experienced on the peninsula since the Second World War have almost certainly favored Indonesian Banded Pigs (S. scrofa vittatus) over Bearded Pigs in those parts of Peninsular Malaysia and Sumatra where sympatry between these species occurs. This poses a further, and potentially serious, threat to Bearded Pigs. Available data indicate that wherever these two species are sympatric, the number of Eurasian Wild Pigs is greater than the number of Bearded Pigs, and that the Eurasian Wild Pig now has a much wider range of distribution than the Bearded Pig throughout these regions. In Sumatra, habitat disturbance has been at least as extensive as in Malaya. A comparison between the current distribution of Bearded Pigs and that of the remaining native forest supports the contention that the species cannot long survive the reduction and fragmentation of these habitats. The same situation probably applies to Bangka and the Riau Archipelago, where habitat disturbance has been at least as extensive as in Sumatra, and where the continued survival of the species is not clear. These animals are also potentially threatened by various contagious diseases. For example, a rinderpest epidemic that killed a large proportion of the domestic cattle population of south-east Borneo between 1871 and 1872 evidently spread to both domestic pigs and Bearded Pig populations over large parts of Borneo. Several similar and successive outbreaks of rinderpest in domestic cattle between 1878 and 1894 also killed off large numbers of these animals. The most serious may have been an epidemic in 1894, when populations of Bearded Pigs had already been severely reduced by epidemics in central Borneo in 1888 and 1889. A final epidemic occurred in 1906, when a great many Bearded Pigs succumbed to a contagious disease in the Tabalung area in South Kalimantan. There are no recent records of such epidemics, but the proximity of domestic animals to remaining Bearded Pig populations is a potentially serious threat, particularly at times when the pigs may already be nutritionally stressed.",Banks (1931) | Barton et al.

This species is endemic to the Philippines , where it is restricted to the “ Palawan Faunal Region,” which extends from Balabac and associated islands in the extreme south-west through all of Palawan Island and its associated offshore islets, as far as the Calamian Islands in the extreme north-east. However, this region also constitutes the easternmost extension of the Sunda Shelf and was intermittently connected by land bridges to Borneo by sea level changes during consecutive Pleistocene glaciations. The species remains relatively widely, if increasingly patchily, distributed. It is heavily hunted throughout most of its range, either for direct consumption or to be sold. One kilogram of pork fetches a price of about twice the price of domestic pork. Pigs are hunted throughout the year, but especially during forest tree-fruiting periods (no specifics are known) when pigs gather to forage on fallen fruits. They are also killed in reprisal for their occasional raids on neighboring forest gardens or other cultivated areas. Hunting methods include snares, low caliberrifles, and small, baited explosive devices known as “pig bombs,” which are made of ping-pong-ball-sized mixtures of gunpowder and shards of porcelain, coated with fish paste or other strong-smelling baits to entice the pigs. These are buried on pig trails or around cultivated plants close to forest edges. They explode when they are unearthed and bitten into by foraging pigs,killing the pigs or, more likely, causing horrendous wounds and producing trails that hunters with dogs can follow to collect the dead or dying animals the following day. S. ahoenobarbus is also threatened by encroachment into forest areas, because ofillegal “kaingin” (slashand-burn agriculture), mining, and other commercial developments. The species is legally protected by Philippine wildlife protection legislation. However, implementation of such legislation is generally poorly enforced and/or realistically unenforceable in most areas—including most designated protected areas. Priority requirements therefore include the more effective implementation of existing legislation and the addition of new protected areas, which should be designed to enable greater management by local governmental authorities than is the case under the existing national system. Awareness campaigns are also important: few hinterland communities are aware of any prevailing wildlife protection legislation, or disregard the laws because of the chronic lack of enforcement by salient governmental authorities. This is especially the case where reprisals against the pigs follow their occasional raids on crops; the reprisals are likely to illicit sympathy and non-action from the responsible agencies. Farming in protected areas and reprisals against the pigs are justified by claims of poverty and loss of livelihood,in spite of the highly dubious nature of such claims. Many claimants are not economically dependent on hunting, but instead hunt for predominately traditional/cultural and recreational reasons.",Boissiére & Liswanti (2006) | Caldecott et al.

Generally they are confined to various types of savanna grasslands, open bushlands, and woodlands, usually within range of perennial surface water. Although usually absent from forests, thickets, cool montane grasslands, deserts, and steppes, Common Warthogs are present in aridlands near the Danakil desert and Bale Mountain forests ( Ethiopia ) and in Djibouti forests. Abundance of Common Warthogs is probably linked to the availability of Aardvark (Orycteropus afer) holes, as the warthogs need deep burrows for protection from predators as well as from fluctuations in temperature and humidity. Their bodies can obviously sustain a certain tolerance range, and they cope with high temperature by sheltering in shade, wallowing, and dust-bathing. Piglets are particularly vulnerable to cold and malnutrition during drought, which, together with predation and other factors, account for an over 50% mortality rate during the first year.","Common Warthogs have an omnivorous diet composed of grasses, roots, fruits, bark, fungi, eggs, and carrion, as well as small mammals, reptiles, and birds. The diet varies with seasonal availability of food items, although the species is very selective. Areas with abundant food resources like bulbs, rhizomes, and nutritious roots can sustain large temporary congregations of animals. This opportunism and dietary versatility account for the Common Warthog’s successful survival strategy. They are powerful diggers, using both snout and hooves, but not tusks. When feeding, they often walk on their anterior knuckles with their hindquarters raised. They use their incisors to wrench grass stems or strip seedheads, and they excavate rhizomes and mineral-rich earth with the hard edge of their snout.","Both sexes reach puberty at 18 months. During the rut, boars locate estrous females by visiting burrows. Male fights consist of frontal-pushing, interlocking tusks, and hitting the opponent in the face or in the flanks. The mating system is promiscuous, with males roaming and mating with numerous females and females mating with more than one male. Where seasons are marked, breeding is seasonal, with females usually coming into estrus early in the dry season and farrowing at the beginning of the rainy season. Non-offspring nursing occurs. Gestation is 160-170 days and most common litter size is 2-3 (range: 1-8).","Common Warthogs are highly diurnal. They go underground before dark and sleep in abandoned burrows of Aardvarks or other animals. Males enterlast and commonly reverse in, with the head facing the opening, ready to fight an intruder or rush out as needed. To a certain extent, season and weather dictate their daytime activity, which includes a range of typical occupations like feeding, drinking, wallowing, rubbing against trees or termite mounds, and grooming. Feeding occurs mainly in early morning and late afternoon, but they also graze between irregular resting periods in the shade of bushy thickets or in mud wallows. Humans, Lions (Panthera leo), Leopards (P. pardus), crocodiles, and hyenas are the main predators, but Cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) and African Wild Dogs (Lycaon pictus) are also capable of catching small warthogs. Females are extremely aggressive and courageous when defending their piglets. It has been reported that Common Warthogs have inflicted deep and deadly wounds in Lions. Common Warthogs have been observed allowing Banded Mongooses (Mungos mungo) and ground hornbills (Bucorvus spp.) to groom them to remove ticks.",,"Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. Common Warthogs occur in most protected areas in savanna zones. Expansion of the Sahel has resulted in a contraction of its range in the north and accounts forits decline in Mauritania and Niger . Because of their susceptibility to drought and predation, populations may easily be prone to local extinction.

On Malenge and Kadidiri Islands, the species is most frequently seen moving through coconut plantations.","B. togeanensis reportedly feeds on rhizomes, fallen fruits (Pangium edule, Dracontomelon sp., Mangiferasp., Artocarpus sp., Spondias dulcis) and also tamarinds and cacao, as well as annual herbs and vegetables.

Babirusas on the Togian Islands are susceptible to habitat loss due to forest clearance and forestfires, to disturbance by humans, and to predation by dogs. They are occasionally hunted by the local people if perceived as a threat to crops. Hunting for food occurs only in a few non-Muslim village communities. In 1998, two thirds of Malenge Island’s forest was damaged by fire. No large animal carcasses were found and babirusas have been seen in several of these localities since, but the fire may have impacted food availability for the species. In 1978, the babirusa population on the Togian Islands was estimated in the region of 500-1000 individuals. Recent estimates place the upper limit of population size at about 500. Local residents questioned recently did not agree on population size, giving ranges from fewer than 100 to more than 1000, but the interview surveys did suggest that at least between 1995 and 2000 there had not been a sharp population decline.",Akbar et al.

No surveys have been done on the habitat use of babirusas on Buru Island, but the local Rana people report that babirusas are most often found in rocky habitat in hilly areas and mountains.","[Local people on Buru report that babirusas primarily feed on leaves, roots, and fruits in the forest, but never enter people’s gardens to feed on crops, unlike the other pig species on Buru, which causes considerable damage to crops. The species is also said to feed along the shoreline when the tide is out.","Nothing is known about the breeding behavior ofthis species, but it is likely to be similar to other Babyrousa spp.","On Buru, B. babyrussa is mostly seen during the morning and late afternoons, but rarely around midday.",,"CITES Appendix I.

Some workers seem to believe babirusas were introduced to these islands, though if this is true these same workers provide no indication of their likely place of origin. Unfortunately, the systematic relationships of babirusas from adjacent eastern and south-eastern parts of Sulawesi remain unknown, so it is also not possible to assess their presumed or potential close affinities to B. babyrussa . During extensive survey efforts on Buru in 1995, no direct evidence of babirusas was found, although a pair of pig mandibles found inland from Fogi, in logged forest at an elevation of 670 m , indicated that the species had been recently hunted. Village interviews in 1997 about the species’ presence suggested that on Buru its range had become fragmented by the 1990s,although locally the animals were still relatively common. The species reportedly was not uncommon on the slopes of Gunung Kepala Mada, the highest mountain on Buru. No surveys have been conducted since, however, and the present status is unclear. The people of Buru differentiate babirusas from other suid species, though it is presently unclear whether any other suids occurring on Buru are of S. celebensis or feral S. scrofa origin, nor whether any such populations (assuming they exist) are naturally occurring or introduced forms.With half the people of Buru being Christian and therefore willing to eat pork, hunting pressure on pigs is likely to be high.

Whereas previously the animal had been reported to occur in low-lying areas near coasts, recent anecdotal and survey reports indicate that the species is now confined mostly to the interior, on higher and less accessible ground. Although often associated with swamp and riverine areas, there is still insufficient data to be conclusive on the aquatic affinities of the species. The species frequently uses mineral salt licks.","Diet and feeding behavior in B. celebensis remain poorly studied in the wild, but observations on captive animals provide a useful picture of their potential diet. The anatomical structure of the stomach and digestive tract suggest that B. celebensis is omnivorous. In zoos, adults ofthis species have been observed to chase, catch, and eat small mammals and birds, implying that they may show similar behavior in the wild. Observations of both wild and captive individuals suggest that the species consumes a wide variety ofleaf , root, and fruit material, with fruit especially important. Their jaws and teeth are strong enough to crack very hard nuts with ease. Not unlike the Bornean Bearded Pig ( Sus b. barbatus ), the apparent requirement of B. celebensis for fruit-bearing trees as a component ofits environment has been implied, because as soon as mature trees were cleared by forestry operations or conversion to food crop production, the babirusas were no longer to be found in the area. Whether this is a result of changes in food resources or increased hunting pressure and disturbance from logging crews has not yet been clarified. B. celebensis forages for food items on the ground, under logs and stones, in wet areas, and on bushes and trees. Animals will stand with their forelimbs against tree trunks to reach hanging leaves and fruit, and will even balance on their hindlimbs to pluck leaves from the trees.","In zoological collections, B. celebensis may become sexually mature as early as 5-10 months of age. However,it is likely that the age of sexual maturity in the wild is influenced by a number of factors, including the level of nutrition. Precise data do not yet exist, but animals are unlikely to breed in the wild before they are one year old. Estrous cycle lengths of 28-42 days have been recorded, but recent endocrine studies suggest a narrower range of 35-37 days. Captive females generally re-cycle within three months after the birth of their young. Estrus lasts 2-3 days, and the female is not receptive to males at other times. Gestation length is usually 155-158 days, though up to 171 days has been reported. The body weight of the sow increases during gestation. The normallitter size in B. celebensis is one or two, but a low incidence of triplet births has been recorded both in zoos and in the wild, and a litter of four fetuses has been reported in utero in a wild female. Neonatal B. celebensis are uniformly brown in color, small in size, and weigh less than 800 g at birth. The female usually has four mammary glands, but an additional pair has sometimes been reported. Although females can have a life span of as long as 24 years in captivity,it is unlikely that animals in the wild live as long, perhaps no more than 7-12 years. In zoos, B. celebensis sows produce young at all times of the year, and may produce two litters within a twelve-month period. However, since it seems likely that diet or seasonal factors would normally influence interbirth intervals, litters may be produced less frequently in the wild. Observation in North Sulawesi revealed adult females accompanied by subadult animals as well as juveniles. However, there was no way to establish whether or not these youngsters represented the progeny of consecutive litters from the same female. Studies of the agonistic behavior of B. celebensis have so far revealed no evidence that the adult males use their teeth during male-male interactions. The ultimate form of agonistic behavior is described as “boxing,” and involves two males raising themselves off the ground until both are standing on their hindlegs facing one another, each leaning and paddling against the chest and shoulders of his opponent. Their snouts are held as high as possible. Females do not employ the same strategy.","Based on observations of captive animals, B. celebensis appears to be mostly diurnal. These animals slept at night, which is consistent with the general lack of activity at night recorded in North Sulawesi . About an hour before sunrise at 06:00 h, individuals began to wake up and move about. Voiding of fecal material and urine occurs at this time, and the animals appeared to prefer to defecate under branches and fallen tree trunks. Foraging extended throughout the day, but occupied a larger proportion of the time in the morning. From about mid-morning onwards an increasing proportion of the time was taken up with non-foraging activities. The animals were either wallowing or lying down. Both in the wild and in captivity, males have been observed to wallow more often than females.",,"CITES Appendix I, although international trade in this species is not thought to be an important issue. Classified as Vulnerable on The IUCN Red List. Adult B. celebensis appear to have few,if any, natural predators. There are no large native mammalian carnivores on Sulawesi , and the most likely non-human predators are probably large snakes and crocodiles. We here follow The IUCN Red List and treat all individuals occurring on Sulawesi , as well as those previously known from the Muna, Buton, and Lembeh Islands as belonging to B. celebensis , pending resolution of the taxonomy. B. celebensis has been much reduced on the northern peninsula of Sulawesi , primarily due to overhunting, and its distribution may now be largely limited to the western end of the Bogani Nani Wartabone National Park, the Nantu Wildlife Reserve, and the Panua Nature Reserve, all of which are in the western half of the northern peninsula. The species still occurs in central Sulawesi and the eastern and south-eastern peninsula, although precise information regarding the current extent of occurrence and area of occupancy is lacking. The species is unlikely to remain on the severely deforested southern island of Muna. On Buton the species was not found during recent mammal surveys, and its continued presence on the island of Lembeh is also uncertain. The small numbers of young born suggest that the species is not adapted to a high rate of natural predation. However, hunting by humans with snares, nets, spears, and dogs has undoubtedly been an important factor since prehistoric times, and widespread snare trapping constitutes the main threat to the remaining populations of B. celebensis in North Sulawesi and, more recently, elsewhere in Sulawesi . B. celebensis is apparently not hunted specifically for its own meat, but represents a by-catch to the hunting of the Sulawesi Warty Pig ( Sus celebensis ). Therefore, the population of B. celebensis in the wild is being placed under severe and increasing pressure by the market demand for wild pig meat. The species is also increasingly threatened by commercial logging, and by the spread of other land-uses resulting in forest conversion and degradation. Total lowland forest loss on the island is estimated to be likely more than 75%. The genus Babyrousa was accordedfull protection under Indonesian law in 1931.

They also feed on grasses, aquatic plants, bulbs,fruit, carrion, and various small animals. They use their snouts to root in the ground and can do serious damage to crops. The species uses the noises and calls of monkeys and frugivorous birds to detect potential food supplies. Seasonal aggregations of Red River Hogs at masting fruit trees account for observations of temporary groups of up to 60 individuals. In Makokou ( Gabon ), these groups are very noisy when breaking hard nutshells of Caula edulis and Irvingia gabonensis, which attracts the attention of predators and secondary feeders. The hogs are sometimes followed by guinea fowl, who peck about the turned over ground for food. Seasonal massive availability of preferred foods and the hogs’ high level of opportunism explain semi-nomadic circuits of movements.","This species uses a wide range ofritualized postures with release of glandular secretions during male fights and rut.

Farrowing occurs in February-March in Nigeria and in December—]January in Gabon , but females can give birth twice yearly in captive conditions.Litters of 1-4 piglets (rarely up to 6) are born in a sheltered hollow covered with a thick mattress of grasses and leaves, where they stay 10-15 days with their mother before joining the rest of the sounder. Weaning occurs at 2—4 months.","These animals are most active in the evening and during the night, and rest in burrows deep within dense thickets during the day. They are capable of covering long distances in search of food, and like to rest in wallows in shallow swamps. The whole sounder runs away when alarmed or frightened.

When cornered or wounded, the adult hogs can display considerable courage and vigorously attack predators, including humans. They are very good swimmers and are frequently seen crossing large rivers.

Within areas of co-occurrence (like the Albertine Rift), the Bushpig lives at higher elevations and the Red River Hog in lowland forests. Elsewhere, the two species are separated by ecological barriers such as the Congo River. Bushpigs occur in a wide range of forested and woodland habitats, from sea level to montane forest (up to 4000 m on Mount Kilimanjaro), with a marked preference for valley bottoms with soft soils and dense vegetation. There are striking differences in habitat among subspecies, with, for example, the hassama race primarily occurring in upland forest areas and the somaliensis race favoring riverine forests.","This species is omnivorous and highly adaptable. It is probably a major seed disperser. Bushpigs consume roots, tubers, bulbs, corn, fungi,fruit, eggs, invertebrates, birds, small mammals, and carrion.

Breeding may take place yearround, but most young are recorded at the end of the dry season or beginning of the wet season. The gestation period is 120-127 days. Just before giving birth, females retire to a sheltered nest or hollow. Most common litter size is 3—4, with a maximum of ten. Newborns weigh 700-800 g. They are weaned at 2—4 months.","Bushpigs are predominantly nocturnal, resting under heavy thickets of vegetation during the day. Nests for raising young or during rainy seasons are built in the cooler parts of their range. In the southern Cape , South Africa , they tend to be more diurnal during the colder months, suggesting that temperature regulation is a significant factor influencing the rhythm of activity. Mud wallowing and rubbing against trees are also regular activities. Population density is regulated by a wide range of predators including humans, Lions (Panthera leo), Leopards (P. pardus), Spotted Hyenas (Crocuta crocuta), pythons, and eagles. Courageous and dangerous when cornered, both boars and sows defend piglets cooperatively and aggressively. Fighting behavior includes frontal and lateral postures with dorsal crest erected, snout-boxing, and forehead shoving. Bushpigs run fast and swim easily. Their senses of smell and hearing are very good, but eyesight only fair.",,"Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List as the species is relatively widespread and common and there are no major threats believed to be resulting in a significant population decline. Though the Bushpig is still relatively widespread, its distribution is patchy in certain regions. It is reported to be increasingly rare outside of protected areas, and widely hunted either for subsistence or for commercial bushmeat trade at local, mostly urban markets. It is also hunted as an agricultural pest, or because it is a vector of livestock diseases like African swine fever, nagana (a form of trypanosomiasis), and sleeping sickness.

Forest Hogs inhabit a variety offorest types: subalpine areas and bamboo groves, forest—grassland mosaics, montane, lowland, and swamp forests, river galleries, wooded savannas, and thickets. It is an ecotonic species, preferring intermediate habitat zones where the edge effect is maximized and where resources from different vegetation types can be exploited within a limited area. It shows a preference for a convenient and permanent water source, thick understory cover in some parts of its home range, and a diversity of vegetation types. In dense forest areas, Forest Hogs tend to concentrate in isolated hilly, rocky habitats of savanna and forest, around clearings, or in mixed forest patches rather than in monodominant forest. The variety of forest habitats occupied implies a high degree of adaptability to local climatic conditions. Forest Hogslive in cold uplands (where night temperatures may fall to 0°C) as well as hot lowlands, but do not tolerate low humidity or prolonged solar radiation.","Forest Hogs are mainly grass-eaters and folivorous. Feeding habits show that they are neither exclusively forest animals nor pure grazers. They display great versatility in food selection, depending on the seasonal content, stage of growth, and quantity of plant resources available. Many species of grasses, sedges, and herbs are cropped. They root much less than other wild pigs and dig only in soft or muddy soils. In a savanna area of the Queen Elizabeth National Park, Uganda , they select more than 100 food plants. In Virunga National Park, however, five major savanna species were selected, on average, over the course of a year; the hogs preferred some grasses during dry seasons and others during rainy seasons, selecting grasses when their nutrient and energetic content is highest. Young piglets are known to feed on grasses well before weaning. In dense forest, both Forest Hogs and Bongos (Tragelaphus eurycerus) use mast seed areas in monodominant stands. Examination of adult hog dung reveals different types of material, including poorly masticated grass seeds, stems, and leaves, fragments of millipedes and shields of ticks, earth nodules, and bristles. They also excavate salty earth with their tusks and lower incisors. These salt licks may be termite mounds, shallow caves, dry river banks, or even the embankment of a deserted road. Occasionally Forest Hogs eat meat and bones ofcarrion, eggs, and larvae. Coprophagy is not common, but piglets are fond of fresh elephant dung.","Adult size and sexual maturity are reached by both males and females at 18 months. There are two mating seasons in Virunga National Park, with births occuring at the beginning of the rainy season. Gestation period averages 151 days. Before parturition, the expectant sow leaves the group and retreats under dense thickets in a nest made of grasses and branches where young are born. Litter size is 2-6 (average 2-4) piglets. The mother rejoins her group with her offspring only one week after parturition. Piglets may nurse from any female in the group, and are protected by all. Weaning occurs at 8-10 weeks. The averagelife expectancy is 3-5 years and average life span is five years, with a maximum of 18 years.","In the grassland-bushland—dry forest mosaic ofVirunga National Park, DR Congo , Forest Hogs spend on average 25% oftheir daily time moving and foraging in savanna, 21% moving, foraging, and wallowing in thickets or forested areas, and 54% resting in a sheltered sleeping site. Activity is most intense in the early morning and late afternoon, with a rest during hottest hours. There is no evidence of true nocturnal activity. Wallowing is a favorite activity, taking up about one hour each day in certain areas. Before sundown, family groupsretire to their sleeping place under dense thickets. Along the trails, the same dung heaps are always used as communal latrines. Males are fierce defenders of their group and sometimes lead the sounders in driving off predators and competitors. When shot at, they will attack humans. Competition between males is violent and may last for half an hour. Males rush at each other from a distance, crashing their foreheads together like rams. Despite their reinforced skulls, deaths among males due to fractures are not uncommon, but most wounds heal. This species is quite vocal, producing a minimum of ten recognizable categories of sounds. The main predators on adults are Leopards (Panthera pardus) and Lions (P. leo). Spotted Hyenas (Crocuta crocuta),, pythons, and eagles prey on young hogs and their mortality rate is about 50%.",,"Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List as the species is relatively widespread, sometimes locally abundant, has a high reproductive potential, and although itis subject to hunting in many parts ofits range,it is not believed to be declining at a rate that would merit its being listed as Near Threatened or in a threatened category.

The distribution of the northern population lies within two vegetation types, “Somalia-Masai Acacia-Commuphora deciduous bushland and thicket” and “Somalia-Masai semi-desert grassland and shrubland.” These habitats range from xerophylous bush and open woodland to subdesert steppe. Desert Warthogs prefer plains on predominantly sandy soils, and avoid hilly terrain. Most records are from lowland areas below 200 m , a few are at higher elevations, but none are above 1000 m . The species is dependent on the availability of water and shade and occupies regions with rainfall of 100-600 mm per year. Areas with higher rainfall are avoided,as are the driest and hottest desert regions with rainfall less than 100 mm per year. Desert Warthogs are not present in the hot coastal zone of Somalia , the eastern tip of Ogaden, and most of the subdesert shrubland east of Lake Turkana . The harsh climatic conditions associated with this vegetation type suggest that the species could,in fact, be totally absent from a vast desert area between Lake Turkana and the Lorian Swamps in north-eastern Kenya . The Desert Warthog, albeit more specialized for extremely arid environments than the Common Warthog, is not a true desert animal.","With its peculiar incisor-less morphology and other cranial features, the Desert Warthog is the most specialized living suid. Its diet is not known, and nothing is known ofits feeding habits and physiology. As the incisors are functionally absent, the lips and gumsare used to detach or pick up food items. The rootless third molars suggest an adaptation toward an abrasive diet.",Nothing is known.,"Little is known. The species seems most active during the day, even during the hottest hours. Family sounders spend the night in burrows. In the valleys of south Somalia , they raid crops seasonally and consequently are persecuted.",,"Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. There are no major threats to the species. However, evenif they live in Muslim-dominated areas, they may be subject to local hunting for bushmeat and trade in their ivory tusks.

The Brush Rabbit is confined to brushy habitat, as its common name implies.","Brush Rabbits feed mainly on grasses, and diets vary according to season and region. In September, they feed on spike rush ( Eleocharis palustris , Cyperaceae ) and grasses ( Poaceae ) such as creeping eragrostis ( Eragrostis hypnoides), foxtail grass ( Hordeum murinum), soft chess grass ( Bromus hordeaceus), and oats ( Avena fatua). Summer diets include wild roses ( Rosa californica, Rosaceae ), Mexican tea ( Chenopodium ambrosioides, Amaranthaceae ), and several plants in the daisy family such as sow thistle ( Sonchus asper), bull thistle ( Cirsium lanceolatum), and Baccharis douglasii; rush ( Juncus sp. , Juncaceae ); and berries ( Rubus sp. , Rosaceae ). In autumn, roots of poison hemlock ( Conium maculatum), stems and leaves of blackberry (R. vitifolia), and berries ( Rubus sp. ) also are eaten. In winter, green clover ( Trifolium involucratum, Fabaceae ) is most preferred, along with new available green grass. Brush Rabbits rarely feed in the open on the mainland, but they prefer to feed in the open and rarely underbrush on Ano Nuevo Island. Before venturing into the open to feed, individuals remain for a while just inside dense brushy cover. After entering an open area next to brushy cover, individuals remain motionless for some time, apparently watching for signs of danger. Several individuals might simultaneously feed in the same area. They rise up on their hindfeet to feed on newly grown tips of plants.","Breeding season of the Brush Rabbit varies from north to south. In California, it lasts from December to May or possibly June, but in Oregon, it lasts from February to August. Gestation lasts 24-30 days, averaging 27 days. Young are born with fine thin hair, do not open their eyes for c.10 days, and suffer postpartum weight loss. Females give birth in nests with cavities of 7.5-15 cm. Nests are lined mainly with hairs from mothers and small amounts of dried grass; nests are closed with plugs constructed of grasses. Young are nursed at night, grow rapidly, and stay in their nests for c.2 weeks. The Brush Rabbit is believed to breed shortly after giving birth, and different females in a population might breed at the same time. Brush Rabbits might have three litters per year in California, but four litters might be possible. Litter size also varies among regions; mean litter size is three in Oregon, 3-5 in northern and central California, and four in west-central California. Juveniles reach maturity at 4-5 monthsold, but it is thought that they reproduce for the first time in reproductive seasons following their births. In Oregon, a female Brush Rabbit produces an average of 15 young/ year in 5-3 litters. Brush Rabbits may not be as fecund as other species of Sylvilagus .","Brush Rabbits are basically crepuscular, being most active between sunset and 02:00 h and again from ¢.06:00 h to 10:30 h. Some reports suggest that most activity occurs in the morning. Individuals are least active between 11:00 h and 16:00 h. They spend considerable time sunning, usually in the mornings or afternoons.

Nothing is known about biology and ecology of the Annamite Striped Rabbit. Threats include habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation from logging, agriculture, and mining and intensive hunting. Although almost all mammals hunted in this region of Laos seem to have some medicinal use, there is no evidence that any medicinal trade demand exists for Annamite Striped Rabbits. They are apparently harvested to feed hunters while in the forests. Heavy hunting pressure might have deleterious effects on extant populations. One problem for the conservation of the Annamite Striped Rabbit might be that most strategies focus on remote high elevational areas, and lowlands are generally degraded by humans and lost to possible management. The Annamite Striped Rabbit inhabits border areas between Laos and Vietnam, and both governments do not actively support any conservation activities for it. Development of management plans and legislation to protect the Annamite Striped Rabbit are recommended. Research on distribution, status, biology, and ecology of the Annamite Striped Rabbit are needed to effectively protect it.

The Sumatran Striped Rabbit is endemic to Indonesia and apparently the rarest lagomorph. Historically,its distribution has been described as extending from southern Sumatra to Aceh along the Barisan Mountains, but no recent records have been made outside western Sumatra even though a numberof surveys and camera trappings have been conducted across the island. Recent sightings and photographs taken in the Bukit Barisan Selatan and Kerinci-Seblat national parks suggest that the two parks serve as current refugia for the Sumatran Striped Rabbit. Considering that it is only active at night and lives in remote inaccessible habitat, it might not be surprising that local people had no name for it when it was discovered. Detailed surveys for other rare species on the island such as the Sumatran Tiger (Panthera tigris sumatrae) or the Sumatran Rhinoceros (Dicerorhinus sumatrensis) have rarely encountered Sumatran Striped Rabbits, so they seem to be remarkably rare. Little is known about the biology, ecology, status, or distribution of the Sumatran Striped Rabbit. Only a dozen museum specimens collected between 1880 and 1916 exist. Since these collections were made, there has been only one confirmed sighting in 1972 and two photographic records of two different individuals taken by automatic camera traps in 1998. A few additional sightings and photographs from camera traps have been reported since 1998. Major threats to the Sumatran Striped Rabbit are deforestation, human encroachment, and poaching in many of Sumatra’s protected areas. Survival of the Sumatran Striped Rabbit depends on continued existence of their mountain forest habitat. Twenty-five years ago, recommendations highlighted urgent need for widespread studies of biology, ecology, status, and distribution of the Sumatran Striped Rabbit, but no funds have been provided to start these studies.

Current population is fragmented and declining and estimated at less than 250 breeding pairs. None of the ten subpopulations is estimated at more than 50 individuals. Moreover, these subpopulations seem to be isolated from each other by anthropogenic barriers, and dispersal of individuals among them is impossible. In the past 70 years, there has been a rapid decline of the population by more than 60% due to a loss of 50-60% of suitable habitat.

Other threats to the Riverine Rabbit include hunting for sport and by farm workers and accidental mortality in traps set for pests on farmlands. Moreover, reduction of Black-backed Jackals (Canis mesomelas) has resulted in an increase of Wildcats (Felis silvestris lybica) and Caracals (Caracal caracal)—main predators of the Riverine Rabbit. Population decline has been arrested due to a decrease in cultivation and public awareness and establishment of conservation areas.

After grazing ceases and grass cover has recovered, habitat becomes optimal for Pygmy Rabbits. This suggests that they are opportunistic, inhabiting disturbed sites in the sagebrush landscape that have an increased density of sagebrush. Intense feeding activity by Pygmy Rabbits near their burrows might sustain or even increase density of sagebrush. Pygmy Rabbits extensively use burrows that they mainly construct by themselves, so soil structure is thought to be another key habitat feature. Soft deep soils are required for burrowing. Burrows typically have 4-5 entrances but up to ten or only two have been recorded. Entrances are located at bases of sagebrush. Burrows are usually found on slopes and are oriented in a north-to-east direction. Entrance diameters are 10-12 cm. Tunnels widen below the surface, form chambers, and extend to a maximum depth of c.1 m. Pygmy Rabbits also use holes among volcanic rocks, in stone walls, around abandoned buildings, and those made by American Badgers (7axidea taxus) and Yellow-bellied Marmots (Marmola flaviventris). Dense stands of big sagebrush growing adjacent to streams, along fences, and in borrow ditches along roads might be used by dispersing Pygmy Rabbits.","Preferred diet of the Pygmy Rabbit is big sagebrush (A. tridentata); individuals sometimes even climb into tops of larger plants to feed. Big sagebrush consists up to 99% of the Pygmy Rabbit's food intake in winter. Grasses ( Agropyron spp. and Poa spp. , both Poaceae ) are more important, with 30-40% ofdiets in midto late summer. A study investigating characteristics of browsed vs. unbrowsed big sagebrush showed that higher crude protein increased chances that plants would be browsed by Pygmy Rabbits, and the opposite was the case for certain plant secondary metabolites.","Testes of male Pygmy Rabbits increase progressively in size beginning in January, peaking in March, and regressing in June. Time of reproduction is dependent on female readiness, which is influenced by photoperiod and vegetative condition of the habitat. A study based on DNA analysis found multiple paternities in the same litter, suggesting that the Pygmy Rabbit has a promiscuous mating system. Pregnant females were collected from late February through late March in Utah and from late March through late May in Idaho. Mating behavior of captive Pygmy Rabbits consisted of chasing and brief copulations, and gestation lasted for 24 days. Females give birth in natal burrows that are separate from residential burrow systems. Natal burrows have a single entrance leading to a nest chamber. Entrances to natal burrows are backfilled with soil and often located at bases of shrubs. Female Pygmy Rabbits returned to burrows to nurse 1-2 times/day in captivity. Litter size averages 5-9 young (range 4-8 young). A maximum ofthree litters per year has been reported in Idaho. Pygmy Rabbits start breeding after their first winter of life. Adult and juvenile sex ratios were not significantly different from 1:1 in Idaho.","Pygmy Rabbits are active any time within the 24hour period, but they are generally crepuscular and highly active in the morning except in winter. Activity level seems to increase at higher elevations with extreme weather conditions. Pygmy Rabbits usually rest near or inside their burrows throughout the day, but they also feed at midday. Forms under vegetation are used during daytime.",,"Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. Population status of the Pygmy Rabbitis extremely varied across its discontinuous distribution. It is locally threatened in parts ofits distribution. The Pygmy Rabbit is not ubiquitous overthis distribution but is restricted to areas of preferred habitat. A small, isolated, reintroduced population exists in Washington after the Columbia Basin population was extirpated by 2004. Habitat loss likely accounts for isolation of the Washington population. In other parts of its distribution, healthy populations remain in areas of expansive habitat. Primary threat to the Pygmy Rabbit is fragmentation of sagebrush rangeland, particularly on edges of its distribution. As these habitat patches become smaller, local extirpations of Pygmy Rabbits might occur. Probability of extirpation increases through overgrazing, uncontrolled wildfires, habitat modification, or genetic drift combined with stochastic events. Nevertheless, the fact that the Pygmy Rabbit can use sites that were once disturbed by grazing and have reverted to big sagebrush indicates that suitable habitat can be created. Where isolated populations of Pygmy Rabbits exist, corridors can be created to connect sites and thereby reduce chances of local extirpation.",Beauvais et al. (2008) | Campbell et al.

Volcano Rabbits occur at highest densities at elevations of 3150-3400 m and occupy areas with abrupt relief. Summer is warm and rainy; winter is cold and dry. Vegetation cover consists of open forest of mostly Montezuma pine (P. montezumae), intermixed with P. hartwegii, P. rudis, P. teocote, P. patula, and P. pseudostrobus (all Pinaceae ) up to 25 m tall. Understory has a dense ground cover oftall (up to 1-5 m), coarse, clumped bunchgrasses, mainly Muhlenbergia macroura, Festuca rosei, I. amplissima, and Stipa ichu (all Poaceae ). Volcano Rabbits also inhabit patches of dense secondary forest of alder ( Alnus arguta, Betulaceae ) up to 12 m tall, with some palm-like Furcraea bedinghausii ( Agavaceae ) up to 6 m tall. Shrub layer is up to 2:5 m tall, with heavy cover of a zacaton grass and herb layer. Volcano Rabbits temporarily colonize cultivated fields of oats ( Avena sativa, Poaceae ) when plants are half-grown in late July until they are harvested in early October. They use burrows with hidden entrances at bases of grass clumps. They probably do not actively dig their own burrows; it has been reported that they use abandoned burrows of the American Badger (Taxidea taxus), the Rock Squirrel (Otospermophilus variegatus), the Nine-banded Armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), and Merriam’s Pocket Gopher (Cratogeomys merriam). Hollows between rocks and boulders and large boulderstrewn sinkholes are used as temporary refuges.","Diet of the Volcano Rabbit consists of zacaton grasses, mainly Festuca amplissima, F. rosei, M. macroura, S. ichu, and Epicampes sp. (all Poaceae ). They select green and tender leaves of these grasses. A. arguta is a staple food. Spiny herbs (Cir sium, Asteraceae , and especially Eryngium , Apiaceae ) are also consumed. Forbs and shrubs are consumed mainly during the dry season. Oat and maize in cultivated fields are eaten during the rainy season.","Reproductive season of the Volcano Rabbit may last throughout the year because pregnant females have been found in January—October and lactating females have been found in February-December. Reproductive peak is noticeable during the warm and rainy summer. In captivity, a male always selected the same female, but in her absence, he became interested in another female. Copulations were observed during the day. The male kept pace directly behind the female, occasionally nuzzling her hindquarters. The female turned back toward his flank, and both circled each other rapidly for several turns. The male then mounted the female and engaged in a series of rapid pelvic thrusts. Parturition always took place at night in captivity. Gestation lasts 38-41 days. Female Volcano Rabbits have postpartum estrus. Nests are found in April-September. Nest is a shallow hole excavated in the ground nextto the base of a clump of zacaton grass and averages 15 cm in diameter and 11 cm in depth. Outer nest materials are dry plant fragments of pine, alder, herbs, and zacaton grass; inside, the nest is lined and filled out with hairs from the mother. Entrance to the nestis covered with plant fragments. Usually, nests are on flat terrain consisting of deep soil. Only a few nests are found on rocky or steep substrates. Mean litter size is 2-1 young (range 1-5), within the range of species of Lepus butsignificantly different from largelitters of species of Sylvilagus and Oryctolagus . Female Volcano Rabbits have three pairs of mammae, but only four mammae, on average, produce milk. Newborns are completely furred, but their eyes are closed. Fur is dusky gray above and pale dull gray below. Tail is externally visible and hair-covered in newborns. Eyes of young open at 4-8 days of age, but they remain in the nest for c.14 days. Young start to feed on solid food in the third week after birth and gradually become independent of the nest. Young are still nursed while moving around with their mother.","Volcano Rabbits are especially active in evening and early morning hours and usually rest quietly in the middle of the day. Nevertheless, large numbers of Volcano Rabbits have been observed outside their burrows between 11:00 h and 13:00 h.",,"CITES Appendix I. Classified as Endangered on The IUCN Red List. The Volcano Rabbit is endemic to Mexico, and its distribution is restricted to three discontinuous areas of core habitat of ¢.386 km? on slopes of Volcan Pelado, Tlaloc, Popocatépetl, and Ixtaccithuatl. Present distribution is fragmented into 16 patches. A distributional survey suggested that Volcano Rabbits have disappeared from areas of the central Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt such as on Volcan Nevado de Toluca or eastern slopes of Ixtaccithuatl where it has been reported in the recent past. A study based on fecal counts and line transects (on horseback) estimated population size at 2478-12,120 individuals. The smaller estimate was recommended for conservation purposes due to broad confidence intervals. Reasons for decline are habitat destruction from increasing encroachment of agriculture up the slopes of mountains, forest fires, overexploitation of timber, cutting of zacaton grasses for thatch and brush manufacture, and human settlements. Large areas of zacaton grasses are burned each dry season to improve grazing for sheep and cattle, but effects of frequentfires are under assessment because new data suggest thatfires actually improve habitat of the Volcano Rabbit. Habitat loss has been estimated at 15-20% over the last three generations. Habitat fragmentation is caused by contiguous habitat loss and highway construction, causing fragmented populations to become genetically isolated and increasing risk of local extinction by random processes. Despite it being illegal under Mexican law, hunting by nearby villagers and people from Mexico City is also a concern. Nesting habits of the Volcano Rabbit make the young particularly vulnerable to predation by dogs and humans. Most localvillagers are unaware of the protected status of the Volcano Rabbit, and although it occurs in several national parks (e.g. Izta-Popo Zoquiapan National Park), hunting and grass burning still occur within their boundaries. One conservation action was establishment of a captive breeding program. The breeding program has been partly successful, but infant mortality has been high. Conservation recommendations are to focus on habitat management including control of burning and overgrazing of zacaton habitat and enforcement of the existing law prohibiting hunting and trade of the Volcano Rabbit. Education at local, national, and international levels about the protected status of the Volcano Rabbit should be improved, and zoos should take part in the breeding program to enhanceits success.",AMCELA | Romero | Rangel | de Grammont & Cuarén (2008) | Barrera (1968) | Cervantes (1980 | 1982) | Cervantes & Lopez-Forment (1981) | Cervantes & Martinez (1992) | Cervantes | Lorenzo & Hoffmann (1990) | Cervantes | Lorenzo & Yates (2002) | Davis & Russell (1953) | De Poorter & Van der Loo (1981) | Fa & Bell (1990) | Fa et al.

The most suitable habitat seems to be a mosaic of the following different habitat types: rich undergrowth cover to provide abundant food, short arboreal cover of young secondary forests to provide hiding places, and old forests to yield acorns in autumn. The Amami Rabbit occurs from sea level up to 694 m on Amami Oshima and 645 m on Tokunoshima.","Diet of the Amami Rabbit consists of more than 29 species of plants: twelve species of herbaceous plants (e.g. Adenostemma lavenia, Asteraceae ; Carex , Cyperaceae ; M. sinensis and Peucedanum japonicum, Apiaceae ; and Mosla dianthera, 1.amiaceae) and 17 shrub species (e.g. Castanopsis sieboldii, Fagaceae ; Melastoma candidum, Melastomataceae ; Rubus sieboldii, Rosaceae ; Styraxjaponicus, Styracaceae ; and Zanthoxylum ailanthoides, Rutaceae ).

The Amami Rabbit is endemic on two Japanese islands: Amami Oshima and Tokunoshima. Its area of occupancyis estimated to be 334-4 km? (301-4 km? on Amami Oshima and 33 km? on Tokunoshima), based on fecal pellet presence and suitable habitat. Amami Rabbits exist in four fragmented subpopulations, three of which are very small. Amami Rabbits are experiencing continuing population declines because of their small area of occupancy, small area and quality of available habitat, and low numbers of mature individuals. Declines are aggravated by invasive predators and habitat loss caused by forest clearing and resort construction. Probably in 1979, the Javan Mongoose (Herpestes javanicus) was introduced to Amami Oshima,resulting in a serious threat because the Amami Rabbit evolved in the absence of large active predators. The only native predator of the Amami Rabbit is a pit viper, the habu snake (Trimeresurus flavoviridis). Feral cats and dogs on both islands also represent an additional threat. Habitat destruction by logging has caused a reduction of old forest by 70-90% since 1980. Forest roads constructed for logging encourage dispersal of predators into forests. Construction of resortfacilities (e.g. golf courses on Amami Island) have destroyed habitat. The larger population on Amami Oshima was estimated at 2000-4800 individuals, based on fecal pellet counts in 2002-2003. This represented a decline of ¢.20% since the last count in 1993-1994 (2500-6100 individuals). Area occupied by Amami Rabbits on Amami Oshima declined by 20-40% from 1977 to 1994.

In the northern part of their distribution, Swamp Rabbits inhabit mature forests, fiveyear-old regenerating forest tracts, and canebrake ( Arundinaria gigantea, Poaceae ) communities at about the 24°C isotherm. They are never far from water. Forms and runways are found in tangled marsh vegetation and brier bushes. Holes in the ground or in trees but also stumps, logs, low crotches oftrees, tangles, cane patches, and open grassy places are common form sites . Elevated objects such as logs are used as defecation sites, and these latrines probably serve as territorial markers. Hence, elevated objects are important habitat requirements. The nominotypical subspecies aquaticus is associated with mature forests, but littoralis is associated with coastal and riparian areas.","The Swamp Rabbit feeds on a variety of plants. One study reported that plants eaten in order of preference were crossvine ( Bignonia capreolata, Bignoniaceae ), sedges ( Cyperaceae ), poison ivy ( Rhus radicans, Anacardiaceae ), grasses ( Poaceae ), catbriers ( Smilax sp. , Smilacaceae ), and tree seedlings. Another study showed that plants were eaten according to their relative availability and were mainly sedges ( Carex lupulina) but also blackberry ( Rubus sp. , Rosaceae ), hazelnut ( Corylus sp. , Betulaceae ), deciduous holly (Zlex deciduas, Aquifoliaceae ), and spicebush ( Lindera benzoin, Lauraceae ).","The Swamp Rabbit is a postpartum synchronous breeder, with estrus lasting generally less than an hour. A series of behaviors precedes estrus: the female chases or threatens males, and males dash and preform a jump sequence. The male chases the female before copulation. Gestation lasts 35-40 days, with 36-37 days being most common. Timing of reproduction varies slightly throughout the distribution of the Swamp Rabbit. Breeding season is longest in the south-central USA and becomes progressively shorter with increasing latitude. Breeding is year-round in Texas but starts in mid-February and ends in August in northern Alabama. Captive females build their nests against or under fences, bases of trees, and wooden structures. Some nests were built a few days before parturition, but others were built the same night. Females regularly build dummy nests but only one-half as many dummy nests as active nests. Young are sometimes scattered among nests at birth. The female lines a nest with her abdominal fur. One female lined her nest with fur just prior to giving birth and began nursing immediately after birth. Most nursing occurred at dawn and dusk, and nursing periods lasted 10-20 minutes. Young continue to nurse after leaving the nest. One nest found in the wild was built on top of the ground in a heavy weed patch, with stalks of dead weeds pulled around an inner lining of fur. Nests are 4-7 cm deep, 15 cm wide, and 18 cm high, and they have side entrances. Meanlitter sizes of Swamp Rabbits vary by region but are 1-6 young, with three young most common.First litters are smaller (e.g. 2.7 in Missouri and 2-8 in Alabama) than second litters (4-1 in Missouri and 3-2 in Alabama). Yearling females may produce largerlitters and more litters per year and thus might have a higher reproductive success than older females. Captive Swamp Rabbits had 1-5 young/year. Adult sex ratio is slightly shifted in favor of females (52-57%). Neonates have dark fur on back, and white fur ventrally and on abdomen. Eyes open at b—8 days of age, and young leave the nest at 12-15 days of age. Young born early in spring reach adultsize in December at ¢.10 months old; young born later in summer do not attain adult weight until the following spring. Juveniles are capable of breeding at 23-30 weeks old, but there are few reports ofjuveniles actually breeding.","Onset of evening activity of Swamp Rabbits is delayed as sunset becomes progressively later in spring. Delay is greatest for females and lower ranking males. Time and onset of evening activity are variable but occur well before sunset in late spring and summer. In late winter and early spring, onset of evening activity occurs during twilight.",,"Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. The Swamp Rabbit is an abundant and important game species in the US states along the Gulf of Mexico. As a game species, harvest is regulated by state wildlife agencies. Habitat in northern parts of its distribution has been destroyed byits alteration and riparian drainages, and as a result, populations of the subspecies aquaticus have begun to decrease. Habitat fragmentation also impedes dispersal. Despite shrinkage of habitats of Swamp Rabbits on distributional peripheries, there are still large areas of prime habitat (e.g. in Louisiana). Populations also have been reported to persist in southeastern Missouri although its habitat has been greatly reduced.

They mostly live aboveground in dense habitat, but frequently use crevices in rocks or burrows as shelter in less dense vegetation.","In California, the diet of the Mountain Cottontail consists mainly of sagebrush, but they prefer to feed on grasses when available in spring and summer. Western juniper ( Juniperus occidentalis, Cupressaceae ) also is eaten. They usually feed underbrush cover or in clearings near shelter.","Start and duration of the reproductive season of the Mountain Cottontail vary across its distribution.

Historically, New England Cottontails occupied early successional forests that became abundant when farmlands were abandoned, and maturation of these forests into closed-canopy stands caused the decline of this species beginning in the 1960s. New England Cottontails prefers habitats with dense understory vegetation and fallow agricultural lands. They avoid venturing into the open and remain in close proximity to cover.","Diet of the New England Cottontail includes a variety of vegetation, but it is the only species of Sylvilagus that extensively consumes conifer needles.","Reproductive season of the New England Cottontail lasts from early March to early September, peaking in March—July.

Twenty percent of pregnancies are from juvenile females breeding in their first year. Hybridization between the New England Cottontails and Eastern Cottontails occurs in the wild, but frequency is unknown. A genetic study conducted in the north-eastern USA where both species live sympatrically indicated that no hybridization occurred.",There is no information available for this species.,,"Classified as Vulnerable on The IUCN Red List. The New England Cottontail historically inhabited boreal habitats throughout south-eastern Canada in southern Quebec and north-eastern USA from southern Maine to Connecticut and New York. Nevertheless, a recent study restricted current distribution to 12,180 km?, c.86% less than the historical distribution. It has been hypothesized that the New England Cottontail is a “refugial relict” and that its patchy distribution resulted from a gradual change in climate coupled with invasion and displacement by the Eastern Cottontail in lowland areas. This process appears to be accelerated by habitat alteration. Status of the New England Cottontail has been of concern to biologists and resource agencies for more than four decades. It once had a widespread distribution across New England, USA, but suitable habitats of early successional forest have declined by ¢.86% since 1960, and available habitat has become increasingly fragmented. Moreover, the Eastern Cottontail has invaded much of the habitat of the New England Cottontail. As a consequence, the New England Cottontail has disappeared throughout much of north-eastern USA. It is suspected that the population of the New England Cottontail has been reduced by more than 50% since 1994. They are rare to scarce in fragmented populations. Even in Barnstable County, Massachusetts, which had one of the densest populations in the 1980s, a dramatically decline seems to have occurred based on the last census in 2000-2001. The New England Cottontail is hunted for sport and food. Major threats are competition with the Eastern Cottontail, landscape fragmentation, and forest maturation. An ongoing population decline is expected because threats are unabated. A recent genetic study showed that populations of New England Cottontails in Maine and New Hampshire and on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, are at great risk due to low genetic variability caused by fragmentation that limits gene flow. Problems for conservation of the New England Cottontail are confusion with the Eastern Cottontail by hunters; lack of education on existence, biology, and habitat requirements of the New England Cottontail; and conversion of native shrublands to other land uses. Recommendations are to develop habitat connections among fragmented populations, increase suitable habitat such as early successional and shrub-dominated areas, prohibition of hunting, and recolonize of suitable habitat by translocations. Research on the New England Cottontail should be conducted on biology, ecology, population status, and competition with other lagomorphs.",Barry et al.

The Desert Cottontail lives from below sea level in Death Valley, California, up to elevations of at least 1829 m. It is often associated with riparian zones in arid regions. In California,its hides are found in heavy brush and willows along rivers. In pine-juniper woodlands, shrubs are its primary cover. Plant species associated with the Desert Cottontail are willows ( Salix sp. , Salicaceae ), buttonwillow ( Cephalanthus occidentalis, Rubiaceae ), wild grape ( Vitis californica, Vitaceae ), greasewood ( Adenostoma fasciculatum, Rosaceae ) in California and arrow-weed ( Pluchea sericea, Asteraceae ), screw-bean mesquite ( Prosopis pubescens) and catclaw ( Acacia greggii), both Fabaceae , in southern Nevada. Occasionally, the Desert Cottontail is found where there is little or no vegetation cover. Abundance of Desert Cottontails is highest under moderate cattle grazing. It relies on thick brambles for cover rather than using holes. The Desert Cottontail in south-eastern Arizona typically builds forms in areas with triangle-leaf bursage ( Ambrosia deltoidea, Asteraceae ) and tall plants (higher than 1-5 m). Desert Cottontails have some physiological adaptations that enable them survive in desert environments. A shift upward of the thermoneutral zone occurs from winter to summer, and basal metabolism decreases by 18% during the same period. Body temperature is 38-3°C when ambient temperatures are below 30°C, whereas body temperature equals ambient temperature of 41-9°C in summer.","Diet of Desert Cottontails depends on seasonal availabilities of plants. Food plants include various unidentified grasses; foxtail grass ( Hordeum murinum, Poaceae ); galingale ( Cyperus sp. ) and sedge ( Carex sp. ), both Cyperaceae ; rush ( Juncus sp. , Juncaceae ); willow ( Salix sp. , Salicaceae ); valley oak ( Quercus lobata, Fagaceae ); miner's lettuce ( Montia perfoliata, Montiaceae ); blackberry ( Rubus vitifolius) and California wild rose ( Rosa californica), both Rosaceae ; hoarhound ( Marrubium vulgare, Lamiaceae ); and Baccharis douglasii and California mugwort ( Artemisia vulgaris), both Asteraceae . True grasses ( Poaceae ) such as Johnson grass ( Holcus halepensis), Bermuda grass ( Cynodon dactylon), blue grass ( Poa pratensis), ripgut grass ( Bromus rigidus), and wheat grass ( Agropyron caninum), as well as morning glory ( Convolvulus sp. , Convolvulaceae ), bull mallow ( Malva borealis, Malvaceae ), honeysuckle ( Lonicera sp. , Caprifoliaceae ), and sow thistle ( Sonchus asper, Asteraceae ) were important dietary items of Desert Cottontails in the Sacramento Valley, California. Desert Cottontails living in fields fed almost entirely on grasses. Cultivated hollyhock, carrots, acorns of valley oak, and fruits of almond and peach also are eaten. Type of cover is an important factor to determine feeding sites. Most feeding in late morning and early evening takes place in areas of brushy cover adjacent to open grassland. Important factors that affect daily feeding periods are habitat, season of the year, fog, rain, and wind. Maximum numbers of Desert Cottontails were observed feeding at dawn. Wind appears to interfere greatly with normal feeding. Light intensity determines distance from shelter an individual will venture for food. Desert Cottontails traveled up to 100 m from cover after dark. They feed by taking successive mouthfuls in open situations. Subsequently, heads are elevated, and they start to chew. They extend their bodies along the ground when feeding on low-growing grasses. Necks are stretched out, and front feet edge forward. Hindfeet are brought forward with hops when food can no longer be reached. Generally, terminal parts of plants are eaten.","Timing of reproductive season of Desert Cottontails depends on the region. In California, it generally lasts for c¢.7 months in December—June, but one study reported that breeding occurred throughout the year. In Arizona, breeding lasts 8-9 months from January until August or September, whereas in Texas,it starts in late February or early March. Female Desert Cottontails give birth in nests. Five examined nests were pear-shaped excavations, 15-25 cm deep, and 15 cm in diameter near their bottoms. Cavities were first lined with thick layers of fine grass and weeds and then filled with the mothers’ fur. Type of site selected for a nest or burrow varies with habitat. Gestation is ¢.28 days. Neonates have sparse hair. When the nest is touched, young lunge upward and utter a “gupp” sound, which might also be a call used prior to nursing. Females nurse young by crouching over their nests. In one occasion, young were nursed between 13:00 h and 14:00 h after 13-5 hours had elapsed since the previous feeding. Another time, young were nursed at 20:00 h following 30 hours without a feeding. Eyes of Desert Cottontails open c.10 days after birth, and young leave the nest 10-14 days after birth but remain near the nest for up to c.3 weeks. Litter size depends on region and is small for species of Sylvilagus . Meanlitter sizes were 2:9 and 2-7 in Arizona, 2-6 in Texas, and 3-6 in California. In Arizona, females produced an average offive litters per year. Sexual maturity is attained ¢.80 days after birth. The Desert Cottontail appears to be less fecund than some other species of Sylvilagus .","The Desert Cottontail is most active in early morning and evening and has activity peaks at 05:00-07:00 h and 18:00-20:00 h. They are inactive at temperatures above 27°C. Individuals seek shelter from rain and high winds. The Desert Cottontail use burrows during most of their daily periods of inactivity in open habitat. They hide by sitting in forms that are small cleared places on the ground. Desert Cottontails are more vigilant in late morning and early evening than at dawn or dusk. In California, they remained hidden in thickets during winter days, but they moved about at any time in late spring.",,"Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. The Desert Cottontail is widespread and common, with a stable population trend. It occurs in a large continuous area and is a habitat and dietary generalist. It is an important game species, and population status is monitored in several states.

These grasslands originate in the succession between primary colonizing grasses through deciduousriverine forest to the sal ( Shorea robusta, Dipterocarpaceae ) forest climax. Tall grassland habitats might also have an understory during later stages of succession. Maintenance of tall grassland habitat is caused by prolonged inundation during the monsoon or by periodic burning in relatively undisturbed areas, or by regular burning, grazing, or regular harvesting in disturbed areas. Tall grassland habitat has different plant species, dominating in different situations. Main types of grassland are composed of Themeda villosa, Saccharum-Narenga associations, Arundo-Phragmates associations, Imperata cylindrica, and Cymbopogon spp. (all Poaceae ) and Alpinia allughas ( Zingiberaceae ), Typha elephantine ( Typhaceae ), and Leea crispa ( Vitaceae ). The Hispid Hare inhabits all of these and other plant communities of varying importance at different times of the year according to availability of cover. During the dry season when most of these communities are subject to extensive regular burning, the Hispid Hare is deprived of cover and all other resources until regrowth of vegetation following onset of early rains a few weeks or even up to 2-3 months later. During this period, the Hispid Hare is entirely dependent on any unburned cover such as marshy sward dominated by Phragmites , Arundo spp. , and Saccharum spontaneum (all Poaceae ) along riverbanks that are maintained by later prolonged inundation and are therefore left unburned. It has been suggested that carrying capacities of Hispid Hares are determined by sizes of small patches of tall grassland that escape annual dry-season burning. Enforced confinement within these isolated patches of post-burn cover might increase susceptibility of Hispid Hares to predation.","Based on fecal analysis, Hispid Hares in Nepal ate 19-23 plant species, with S. spontaneum, I. cylindrica, Desmostachya bipinnata, and Cynodon dactylon (all Poaceae ) having the highest frequency of occurrence in feces. Composition of plant species in the diet was proportional to availabilities. A significantly higher diversity of plants was recorded in the diet of Hispid Hares after the fire. Another study reported that Hispid Hares ate inner parts of stems of Narenga porphyrocoma, leaves of Cymbopogon sp. , I. cylindrical, and inner cores of S. spontaneum.","Based on a three-month study in western Nepal, Hispid Hares bred in January/February during the post-burn period in a belt of floodplain habitat dominated by marshes, swamps, oxbow lakes, and tall dense grasslands, intermixed with riverine forest. Uniformly small size of scrotal testes in males suggests a monogamous mating system. A single fetus found in a pregnant female during the study in western Nepal, a single young born in captivity, and four nipples on captured females suggest that Hispid Hares have small litter sizes. It is unknown if young Hispid Hares are altricial or precocial, but they might be intermediate as are young Volcano Rabbits ( Romerolagus diaz), which live in a similar habitat. Nests of Hispid Hares were made with leaves of Narenga ( Poaceae ), laid outcircular shapes.",The Hispid Hare is crepuscular.,,"CITES Appendix I. Classified as Endangered on The [UCN Red List. The Hispid Hare receives maximum protection in India under Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 and in Nepal under Schedule I of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Measures Act of 1973. It has been nationally listed as endangered in India and critically endangered in Nepal. Almost no information is available about population status of the Hispid Hare, but there is no doubtthat it has declined substantially due to loss oftall grassland habitat. It has been estimated that a population decline of 20-50% in suitable habitat has occurred since 1994 and the decline is expected to continue at this rate. The few patches oftall grassland habitat that remain all occur in national parks, wildlife reserves, and sanctuaries scattered across the former distribution of the Hispid Hare. There have been very few records from Uttar Pradesh and Assam since 1951. Current populations exist in a few isolated patches across its former distribution. Area of occupancy is estimated at 11-500 km?. Isolated relict populations of Hispid Hares remain at risk because of continuing degradation of habitat even within these protected areas. Major threats are habitat destruction for agriculture, forestry, human settlement, flood control, and irrigation schemes. Additional threats are habitat degradation due to dry-season burning, illegal grazing, and harvesting of tall grasslands. Recommendations are to further study distribution, status, biology, and ecology of the Hispid Hare. Research on its distribution should be conducted at different times of the year because Hispid Hares change habitat according to availabilities of cover during flood and burning seasons. Control of the burning season within the distribution of the Hispid Hare is needed to ensure that suitable habitat is available throughout the year. Moreover,status surveys of tall grassland habitats should be conducted. Results of a study on investigating effects of burning and cutting of grassland dominated by I. cylindrica showed that patches of grassland could be left unmanaged for a two-year rotation without significantly altering composition of the plant community and thereby provide refugia for cover-dependent species such as the Hispid Hare. More studies, particularly long-term ones, investigating effects of disturbing factors to habitat are required to formulate appropriate long-term management plans for remnants tall grassland.

South American subspecies inhabit arid and semiarid regions mostly in dry upland habitats. Habitat of the Eastern Cottontail has been improved by interspersion of old fields and briar thickets, creation of edge, establishment of open feeding areas, and breaking up large continuous areas of monotypic habitat. Forms used during inactivity are chosen to provide cover and shelter and consist of brush piles and herbaceous and shrubby vegetation. Dens can be used to escape.","Diet of the Eastern Cottontail includes a wide variety of plant species. Herbaceous plants are eaten during growing seasons, and woody plants are eaten during dormant seasons. Herbaceous plants might also be eaten throughout the year except when covered by snow. Two pronounced feeding periods have been reported: 3—4 h after sunrise and from sunset to one hour after sunset. Feeding habits of Eastern Cottontails vary seasonally and with successional changes of plant communities.","Timing of reproduction of Eastern Cottontails depends on latitude, elevation, and weather and varies among subspecies and populations and within the same population from year to year. Diet and rainfall might be important factors particularly in arid regions. Reproductive season begins later at higher elevations and northern latitudes; populations may breed throughout the year or only for ¢.6 months. Synchronized breeding behavior of Eastern Cottontail, even throughout the breeding season, has been recorded, and the synchronized initial pre-estrus stage for all populations over a wide geographical area is probably regulated by photoperiod. Reproductive interactions between males and females consist of a sequence of patterns that precede and culminate in copulation. This includes the male and female turning in a threat posture (face off), the male rushing the female, the female jumping over the male, and finally again the face off. When the female retreats from the male after a face off, the male chases the female before copulation takes place. Gestation typically lasts 28— 29 days but can be 25-35 days. Numbers oflitters per year are 3-7. Sizesoffirst litters of the year are 3-5 young and influenced by age or previous reproductive experience of females. Mean littersizes are 3-1-5-6 in the USA but usually only two young and rarely 1-3 young in South America. Mean annuallitter sizes are correlated with latitude and other factors such as conception dates, body weight, elevation, and, on one occasion, longitude. Annual numbers of young per female are 6-35. Young are born in a nest with a slanting hole into the ground. Nest’s measurements vary: lengths of 13-18 cm, widths of 10-13 cm, and depths of 9-12 cm. There is no relationship between nest size and litter size. Nests have outer linings of grass and herbaceous stems or leaves and inner layers of mothers’ fur. At birth, young Eastern Cottontails have fine hair, have tightly closed eyes, and are able to crawl into their nests. Eyes open at 4-8 days of age, and they leave nests at 12-16 days of age. Onset of sexual maturity is related to the first adult molt. Twenty-seven to 52% ofjuveniles breed during theirfirst year, but productivity is much lower than that of older individuals.","The Eastern Cottontail is most active at dawn and dusk, with increased activity on moonlit nights. Activity was greatest during summer when nights were shortest and when air temperature ranged from —18°C to 1°C. Rain apparently reduced activity.",,"Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. The Eastern Cottontail is the most widely distributed species of Sylvilagus and is abundant throughout its distribution, with an increasing population trend. It is unique among leporids of the world in that it occurs over broad geographical provinces. It has been widely introduced in North America and Europe. For example, introduction in France failed, but introduced Eastern Cottontails in northern Italy seem to expand. Introductions have permanently altered the gene pool of the Eastern Cottontail and also caused displacement of sympatric species such as the New England Cottontail in north-eastern USA. The Eastern Cottontail is an important game species especially in the USA and has been subject of numerous research projects and publications. The Eastern Cottontail is an aggressive species and a highly efficient colonizer, and it can displace other leporids as it expandsits distribution. Therefore, introduction of Eastern Cottontails to alien habitats is not recommended. Although it is abundant, subpopulations are threatened by hunting pressure, human perturbation, and predation from introduced species. Some populations are threatened by livestock competition and habitat fragmentation. Research is needed on taxonomy of the Eastern Cottontail and on how it affects other leporids.",Allen | D.L.

Black-tailed Jackrabbits favor heavily grazed areas, or where grasses are not abundant and cacti and low shrubs are scattered. They inhabit open habitats with mesquite ( Prosopis ), sagebrush ( Artemisia ), desert scrub, and open pine ( Pinus )—juniper ( Juniperus ) in Arizona. They avoid areas of tall grass or forest where visibility is obscured. Where Black-tailed Jackrabbits and Antelope Jackrabbits ( L. alleni ) live in sympatry, they are often seen togethersitting under the same bush or running away side by side. Antelope Jackrabbits are more numerous on grassy plains at high elevations, and Black-tailed Jackrabbits are more numerous in mesquite along valley bottoms and in barren chaparral desert.","Diet of the Black-tailed Jackrabbit varies among locations and seasons, but grasses and sedges are primarily eaten in summer. In Utah,it ate nearly all plant species available, including sagebrush ( Artemisia tridentata, Asteraceae ) and shadscale ( Atriplex confertifolia), Nuttall’s saltbush (A. nuttalliz), winterfat (Ewrotia lanata), and saltlover ( Halogeton glomeratus) all Amaranthaceae . The Black-tailed Jackrabbit also eats fungi, gravel, or sand, and it has been reported to feed on horse carcasses in Texas and Tamaulipas. During winter or in desert areas, the main food is dry and woody plant parts such as broom snakeweed ( Gutierrezia sarothrae, Asteraceae ) and creosote bush ( Larrea tridentate, Zygophyllaceae ). There is no evidence that the Blacktailed Jackrabbit drinks free water. In dry habitats, succulent plants and cacti are increasingly eaten as drought conditions increase. Shade seeking reduces heat load and need for water. Other factors that contribute to reducing water loss are insulation and reflectivity of pelage. The Black-tailed Jackrabbit can damage agricultural crops. In Kansas (USA), most crop damage was restricted to fields near resting areas, and buffer fields reduced damage. While feeding, Black-tailed Jackrabbits move slowly and are constantly alert for sings of danger. They rely on hearing more than on other sense to detect danger. Black-tailed Jackrabbits rear up on their hindfeet to browse on bushes.","Reproductive season of the Black-tailed Jackrabbit depends on latitude. In California, males are sexually active in all months of the year, but in Kansas, they are active in December—August. Breeding season is shortest in regions with severe winters (e.g. 128 days in Idaho) and longest in areas with warmer winters (e.g. 220 days in Kansas and more than 300 days in Arizona). A sexually active male Black-tailed Jackrabbit seeks a female with his nose close to the ground. Courtship behavior includes circling, hunting, approaching, chasing, jumping with urine emission, and boxing; copulation usually follows. These complex sequences of behavior may be repeated a couple of times. Breeding is promiscuous. Copulation occurs repeatedly, which induces ovulation. Gestation is c.43 days.Litter size is positively correlated with latitude and averages c.2 young in Arizona, c.3 young in Kansas and Nevada, and c.5 young in Idaho and California. Maximum number of young per litter is seven in California, Idaho, and Nevada. Litter size is dependent on environmental conditions during a particular year, quantity of precipitation, and time of the year; largest litters occur in the middle or end of the breeding period. There are 3-8—4-4 litters/year in Kansas and 3-6 litters/ year in Arizona. Postpartum estrus occurs, but consistent postpartum breeding does not occur in Kansas. Young are placed put in prepared nests with some hair for lining or in nests resembling shelters under bushes when soil is hard. Young are fully furred, and eyes are open at birth. Pelage of young is brown and richer in color than mothers’ pelage. Ear tips and tail are black. Dark natal fur gradually is replaced by paler immature pelage. Adult pelage occurs in the first winter when young are 6-9 months old. Young are nursed exclusively for their first ten days of life, and solid food is gradually eaten; they are weaned at 12-13 weeks of age. Until young are c.1 week old, they suckle lying on their backs, with their hindfeet around their mothers’ necks; then, nursing position changes to an upright posture. Newborns stay close to their birthplace for their first two days oflife; they gradually enlarge their home ranges and spend a lot of time digging. Females stay some distance away and moveto their litters only at night to nurse. Early-born females might breed in their first year of birth.","The Black-tailed Jackrabbit is primarily nocturnal, with activity peaks at 04:00-07:00 h and 18:00-20:00 h. Feeding periods vary greatly with weather, season, and moon phase. Wind is the most important weather factor limiting activity. Calm and dry evenings are more favorable for longer feeding periods than windy and wet evenings. Falling snow and fog limit nocturnal activities, but rain and temperature have little effect on movement. The Black-tailed Jackrabbit often builds forms to protect itself from heat during the day by making excavations in sand under vegetation. In the Mojave Desert, USA, the Black-tailed Jackrabbit retreats to burrows during hot summer days but only for 3-5 hours in the afternoon. Self-constructed burrows begin as forms and gradually are deepened by digging during hot afternoons. After several days, burrows are deep enough to enclose an individual. Some Black-tailed Jackrabbits also use holes dug by prairie dogs (Cynomys) or American Badgers (Taxidea taxus). Burrows are not used during high winds or cold weather, even though they are typically available.",,"Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. The Blacktailed Jackrabbit is widespread, and its distribution is expanding. Because the Blacktailed Jackrabbit adapts well to overgrazed areas, it seems to expand at the expense of the White-tailed Jackrabbit (L. townsendii) in the north-east and the White-sided Jackrabbit ( L. callotis ) and Antelope Jackrabbit in the south of its distribution. Major threats are hunting for sport and local subsistence, human perturbation, predation by introduced species, competition with livestock, habitat fragmentation, and humaninduced fires. Research is needed to definitively classify subspecies and on interactions among Black-tailed Jackrabbits and other sympatric jackrabbits (i.e. White-tailed Jackrabbit, White-sided Jackrabbit, and Antelope Jackrabbit).",AMCELA | Romero & Rangel (2008g) | Angermann (2016) | Arias-Del Razo et al.

Cape Hares move into burned areas as soon as grasses begin to sprout. Distribution of the Cape Hare has increased with bush clearing and extensive savanna fires. On the Arabian Peninsula, the Cape Hare prefers shrubs rather than grasses for shelter in summer. In the Namib Desert, it makes short burrows to avoid exposure to the sun.","Cape Hares are herbivorous and graze on grasses at night. Diets presumably vary according to habitat. Fecal analysis in Kenya revealed that 19% ofthe diet was dicotyledons, 40% grasses, 1% sedge, and 32% stem fibers. Grasses in the diet included Sporobolus sp. , Aristida sp. , Chloris sp. , Cynodon dactylon, Enneapogon sp. , and Eragrostis sp (all Poaceae ). The study found differences in proportions of grass species eaten at different sites, but seasonal differences, including wet and dry seasons, were small at each site. The Cape Hare is reasonably opportunistic, selecting different grass species according to their availabilities. It is expanding its distribution at the expense of less adaptable species of Lepus because it thrives on overgrazed pastures.","Reproduction of the Cape Hare varies by location. Near the Equator, males are sexually active and females pregnant throughout the year. Pregnancy rates are 80-100% for most of the year, except in April (wettest month of the year) and June/ July (end of wet season). Females have 6-8 litters/year, with a mean littersize of 1-5, or an average of 11-6 young/year. Mean littersize varies seasonally, probably in response to changes in rainfall and forage (one young in September to 1-9 in January). Litter size also varies by elevation; Cape Hares at higher elevations have small litters (mean of 1-2 young at 1800 m) than those at lower elevations (mean of 1-7 young at 600 m).",Cape Hares are nocturnal.

No population information is available for the northern African region ofits distribution. Population trends of Cape Hares in Arabia are characterized by moderate declines. Current population trends of Cape Hares on islands in the Persian Gulf, specifically Masirah Island and Bahrain, are of concern because it is possible that the form of the Cape Hare living on these islands is a distinct species. The population of the Cape Hare on Sardinia has been declining even though it is characterized as locally common. The Cape Hare has experienced habitat loss on the Arabian Peninsula since the 1950s mainly caused by urbanization, habitat fragmentation, overgrazing, livestock competition, agricultural encroachment, recreational activities, harvest/hunting, and infrastructure development related to tourism. These threats will likely lead to continuing population declines on the Arabian Peninsula.

Mountain Hares prefer to live in forests of pine, birch, and juniper. In Scotland and Ireland, heather moors and bog land are favored, and in Russia, copses in the middle of open steppe and reed belts around lakes are selected. In the Alps, Mountain Hares prefer highly structured forests and thickets at forest edges. In spring, abundant herbaceous food in meadows is important to Mountain Hares. When a habitat offers food and shelter against predators, Mountain Hares use it for rest and activity. Forms are usually a depression they make. In snow, Mountain Hares burrow to make forms and enter rock crevices or marmot (Marmota) burrows for shelter or escape. They sometimes dig permanent burrows 1-2 m long in the ground. Mountain Hares in Ireland and the Alps do not burrow, but in Russia, complex burrows up to 7 m long have been reported. On agricultural land, Mountain Hares tends to be replaced by European Hares ( L. europaeus ) in Europe and Cape Hares ( L. capensis ) further east.","Mountain Hares are grazers in summer and browsers in winter. Their diets vary with habitat. Plant species used as food in forest habitats include leaves and twigs of Salix and Populus (both Salicaceae ), Sorbus ( Rosaceae ), Betula ( Betulaceae ), Juniperus ( Cupressaceae ), and Vaccinium ( Ericaceae ); on Scottish moorlands and Swedish islands, Calluna ( Ericaceae ) is eaten. Different grass species and clovers are eaten when available. With snow cover, Mountain Hares feed on twigs, bark, moss, and lichens. They seldom drink water but may eat snow. Re-ingestion ofsoft pellets takes place at 09:00-16:00 h and increases dietary digestibility up to 25%; these pellets contain three times as much protein as regular pellets. Mountain Hares feed with their back to the wind and can clear snow from vegetation with their forepaws. When snow is hard, they move to lower ground to feed.","Gestation of the Mountain Hare lasts 46-55 days. Postpartum estrus with copulations a few hours after parturition is common. Superfetation does occur. Females have predominantly 2-3 litters/year, with litter sizes of 1-3 young, resulting in 5-9 offspring/female during a reproductive season. Weather has an important influence on numberof litters produced during a reproductive season.","Mountain Hares are nocturnal throughout the year, with a prolonged resting phase during the day. Activity patterns change seasonally with circadian rhythms. Mountains Hares rest by day in a form, with ears back and eyes half closed, but they only sleep for a few minutes at a time. In summer when daylight increases and in winter when food is scarce, more Mountain Hares are active during the day. Activity is highest during the first two hours after sunset.",,"Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. The Mountain Hare is widespread, populations appear to be stable across much ofits distribution, and it occurs in many protected areas. Nevertheless, historical game bag records in Northern Ireland indicate that there has been a substantial decline in abundance. Moreover, historical and recent records indicate that distribution of Mountain Haresis decreasing in southern Sweden. This decline started simultaneously with introduction of European Hares and continues while they expand northward. Furthermore, hunting statistics from Grisons, Switzerland, indicate a possible shift of both species to higher elevations. From 1990 to 2010, European Hares and Mountain Hares annually ascended more than 6 m and 3 m, respectively. Results of the study showed that European Hares advanced faster to higher elevations than Mountain Hares. A possible threat to the Irish Hare might be an introduced and expanding population of the European Hare in Ireland. The two examples from Sweden and Switzerland suggest that European Hares benefit from global warming and expand their distribution northward and to higher elevations and, thereby, might displace the Mountain Hares from their current distribution. Competitive exclusion and hybridization and introgression might explain how the European Hare is involved in the continuous decline of the Mountain Hare. Comparison of distributions of European Hares and Mountain Hares in Europe reveals that wherever European Hares occur, Mountain Hares are restricted to higher elevations or deep forests. It seems that European Hares and Mountain Hares are ecologically equivalent and strongly compete with one another. Studies of food preferences show that Mountain Haresin Ireland eat more grasses and herbs than Mountain Hares that live in sympatry with European Hares. Consequently,it has been argued that competitive exclusion by the European Hare restricts Mountain Hare distribution. Besides, in sympatric areas the forms of Mountain Hares are located in denser forest and further away from open fields than in allopatric areas. European Hares also expand their distribution and use of various habitats when densities of Mountain Hare are low. All these studies show that European Hares have the potential to expand into Mountain Hare territory and,in sympatry, Mountain Hares disappear from optimal European Hare habitat. European Hares and Mountain Hares hybridize with each other. Offspring are morphological intermediate and fertile. Normally, a male European Hare will mate with a female Mountain Hare. Reciprocal hybridization is also possible, but very rare due to typical mating behavior of European Hares and Mountain Hares in natural surroundings. Each time a Mountain Hare female hybridizes with a European Hare male, the local Mountain Hare population loses a species-specific litter. Consequently, observed decline in distribution and densities of Mountain Hares may be a direct consequence of unidirectional hybridization. This phenomenon is described as extinction by hybridization in the literature.",Acevedo | Jiménez-Valverde et al.

Northern populations of Alaskan Hares primarily live in tundra or alluvial plains, and southern populations primarily live in coastal lowlands. Diet of the Alaskan Hare in April/May consists mainly of shrubs. Woody parts of the Alaskan willow (S. alaxensis) and leaves of crowberry are most commonly eaten. In spring, they fed at edges of melting snow patches where crowberries from the previous summer were abundant. One captive Alaskan Hare seldom drank water. Breeding. Mating season of the Alaskan Hare occurs in mid-April and May, and gestation is ¢.46 days. Parturition occurs in late May and early June and seems to coincide with loss of snow cover in late May. Females have one litter per year, with 5-7 young (average 6-3 young). Precocial young are born in a nest aboveground in thick shelter of willow or alder. Nests are mere depressions in the vegetation and have no lining. Young have brownish buff upper parts and white under parts. Nose, eye rings, and feet are buff. Ear tips are black, and tail is white. Female Alaskan Hares nurse 5-9 weeks—a prolonged nursing period probably enhances survival of young and perpetuates rapid growth. A few weeks after birth, young begin to drift away from their mother. Rapid growth allows young to reach minimum adult body mass during the short summer; young are fully grown by late September. Initial rate of growth of the Alaskan Hare is greater than that of the Snowshoe Hare ( L. americanus ), the Black-tailed Jackrabbit ( L. californicus ), and the White-tailed Jackrabbit (L. townsendi). Activity patterns. Alaskan Hares leave dense thickets in the evening to feed. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Alaskan Hares live alone, except during mating when groups of 20 or more are observed. If they still have their winter pelage in May, they remain near snowfields at high elevations.

The Artic Hare prefers hillsides or rock-strewn plateaus rather than flat bog land. Throughout most ofits distribution, it spends summer in the tundra north of the tree limit, but in winter, it might penetrate up to 160 km into the forest. Areas with little snow cover and wind exposure are favored, and groups of several hundred Arctic Hares may aggregate in such areas in winter, moving from one place to the other in search for food.","The Arctic Hare feeds mainly on woody plants throughout the year. Arctic willow ( Salix arctica, Salicaceae ) is the main species eaten in all seasons, and its leaves, buds, bark, and roots make up to 95% of winter diets. It also feeds on mosses, lichens, buds, and berries of crowberry ( Empetrum niger, Ericaceae ), young blooms of saxifrage ( Saxifraga oppositifolia, Saxifragaceae ), mountain sorrel ( Oxyria digyna, Polygonaceae ), and various kinds of grasses. Summer diets of Arctic Hares are highly variable but mainly contain Arctic willow, mountain avens ( Dryas integrifolia, Rosaceae ), and grasses. On Baffin Island, dwarf willows (S. arctica and S. herbacea) and crowberry are the main food. In Greenland, diets consist of Arctic willow and mountain sorrel. The Arctic Hare regularly feeds on stomach contents of eviscerated Caribou (Rangifer tarandus). Water is obtained by eating snow. It makes trails from one grazing place to the next. Often high places are selected to forage. Arctic Hares dig through snow to find food. If snow has a hard crust, they stamp on it with their forefeet to make a hole. Feeding usually occurs in morning and evening.","Mating season of the Arctic Hare occurs in April/May. The male follows the female continuously. During copulation, the male bites the female fiercely on neck and back that she often is covered with blood. Mating corresponds with molting, so fur “flies” during the process. Gestation is c¢.53 days. Young are born in May-July in nests lined with dry grass, moss, and fur from the mother. Nests are either a depression among mosses and grasses or under or between rocks. Females have litter of 2-8 young, with an average of 5-4 young. Females in the far north have one litter per year, and in Newfoundland, average litter size was three young. Newborns are blackish brown, with white bellies, chins, and throats. When threatened, young flatten out on the ground, with their eyes closed and ears pressed tightly on their backs. During the first 2-3 days oflife, the mother stays with her young and defends them against danger. Nursing takes place every 18-20 hours, and nursing bouts lasts 1-4 minutes. By the third day oflife, young hide among stones when danger approaches. After c.2 weeks oflife, young disperse and hide behind rocks appearing only when nibbling on vegetation or nursing. The mother remains near the nursing site. Gradually, young increase their movements to a maximum of c.1 km from where they were born. Juvenile pelage is darker than summer pelage of adults. By the third week of life, young leave their mothers and form nursery bands of up to 20 individuals. Young are weaned at 8-9 weeks old. By late July, they are nearly as large as their parents and are white. Young breed for the first time as yearlings. Adult sex ratio of Arctic Hares is biased toward males.","The Arctic Hare rests during the day when the sun is shining, but during the dark winter, it has no fixed time for resting. When resting,it usually sits near a large stone, dozing or asleep, sheltered from wind, covered from aerial predators, and warmed by the sun. Usually, it chooses a site a little way up a slope. Arctic Hares often are immobile during resting,sitting crouched, with ears halfway erect and eyes nearly closed. Often 2—4 individuals rest together.

Distributions of the Arctic Hare and the Snowshoe Hare ( L. americanus ) slightly overlap, but the two species differ in their habitat preferences. The Arctic Hare occupies treeless barrens or tundra, whereas the Snowshoe Hare inhabits forests. In Newfoundland, replacement of the Arctic Hare by the Snowshoe Hare might be an example of competitive exclusion.

Distribution of the White-tailed Jackrabbit extends into the badlands of South Dakota and montane pastures among scattered evergreens in Colorado. White-tailed Jackrabbits use shallow forms at bases of bushes or besides rocks. In winter, they use cavities connected by tunnels dug c.l m into snow or use shrubs and trees for cover. When White-tailed Jackrabbits and Black-tailed Jackrabbits ( L. californicus ) are sympatric, they use different habitats. White-tailed Jackrabbits occur in open flats and fields of ryegrass ( Lolium , Poaceae ) in Oregon and bunchgrass and rabbitbrush in Washington; Black-tailed Jackrabbits inhabit predominantly sagebrush ( Artemisia , Asteraceae ). In California, the White-tailed Jackrabbit was recorded more often on higher slopes and ridges, and the Black-tailed Jackrabbit more frequently on valley floors.","The White-tailed Jackrabbit feeds primarily on succulent grasses and forbs. Shrubs are eaten in winter after grasses and forbs have become dry. When feeding on shrubs, woody stems are favored over leaves. Diet selection is influenced by age of White-tailed Jackrabbits, season, and availabilities of plant species. Abundant plant species in diets ofthis species are alfalfa ( Medicago sativa, Fabaceae ), creambush ( Holodiscus discolor, Rosaceae ), sagebrush, clover ( Trifolium sp. , Fabaceae ), common dandelion ( Taraxacum officinale, Asteraceae ), dryland sedge ( Carex obtusata, Cyperaceae ), Indian paintbrush ( Castilleja integra, Orobanchaceae ), goosefoot ( Chenopodium sp. ), and winterfat (Ewrotia lanata), both Amaranthaceae . One study in Colorado recorded 67 plant species in stomachs of White-tailed Jackrabbits. Pregnant or lactating females usually feed alone; males feed in groups of 2-5 individuals. After feeding, White-tailed Jackrabbits groom their heads and ears with their forepaws and lick their bodies. When sympatric, the White-tailed Jackrabbit seems to be a more selective feeder than the Black-tailed Jackrabbit and therefore has a competitive disadvantage.","Reproductive season starts in late February and ends in September. Breeding condition and environmental factors affect number oflitters born in a year. In the southern part of the distribution, a maximum of fourlitters are produced per year: the first in late April, the second in earlyJune, the third in middle July, and the fourth in late August or early September. In the northern parts of the distribution, only one litter is produced per year between May and early July. Gestation lasts 30-43 days and might be influenced by elevation and latitude. Litter sizes are 1-11 young, with an average of 4-5 young. The White-tailed Jackrabbit is polygamous. Courtship behavior involves a series of circling, jumping, and chasing activities that last 5-20 minutes and end in copulation. Normally, groups of 3-5 males chase one female during the evening hours. Subspecies campanius has breeding synchrony, and postpartum estrus allows conception immediately after parturition. Expected reproductive potential was estimated at 23 young/year, but due to prenatal mortality, it averaged 15 young/year. Nests for young are made of dry leaves and grasses, densely lined with fur from mothers, and well hidden in bushes or vegetation; alternately, they might only be a form on bare ground. Young are born fully furred, with open eyes and mobile to a limited extent. They start to forage at c.15 days old and are completely weaned at c.1 month old. Individuals have the potential to breed as early as c¢.7 months of age, but there is no evidence ofjuvenile breeding.","White-tailed Jackrabbits are nocturnal and forage mainly between sunset and sunrise. A study in summer revealed that they start feeding at 15:00-16:00 h, peak activity was at 22:00-01:00 h, and most activity stopped by 03:00-04:00 h.

Since the early 1900s, there was a gradual distributional expansion to the north and east as favorable habitats (e.g. agricultural land) were created. Since about the 1950s, there has been a gradual reduction in the distribution of the White-tailed Jackrabbit coupled with distributional expansion of the Black-tailed Jackrabbit in the north-western part ofits distribution where habitats have been altered to favor the latter. The White-tailed Jackrabbit does not occur in most of Nebraska and Kansas anymore, and existence in Missouriis debated. Population status of the White-tailedJackrabbit across its entire distribution is currently unknown, but declines have been observed in two national parks in Wyoming. Populations in Grand Teton and Yellowstone national parks decreased to only a few individuals in 1978 and 2008. Causes for these declines are currently unknown.

During feeding, dominance hierarchies among individuals have been demonstrated.","Reproduction of European Hares takes place from winter solstice until the end of summer, with a peak in spring (“March madness”). During the peak, males congregate around a female in estrus. The female boxes and chases off males. Female European Hares have 1-5 litters/year, with an average ofthree litters per year. Females have between 4-6 young/year in Argentina and 13 young/year in the Czech Republic, but in most populations, females are remarkably consistent at ¢.10 young/year. Litter size can vary with respect to season, with smaller litters produced earlier and larger litters later. Superfetation (a female ovulates while pregnant and then carries both embryos and fetuses) is common in captivity and reduces normal gestation of¢.42 days to ¢.38 days. In the wild, superfetation is less common. Nursing takes place once per day, about one hour after sunset, and lasts only a few minutes. Females reach maturity at 7-8 months old and males at ¢.6 months old. Young from the firstlitters of the year may breed in theirfirst year. Where sympatric, European Hares and Mountain Hares ( L. timidus ) can hybridize and produce fertile offspring.","European Hares are mostly nocturnal. In winter, activity starts with regularity shortly after sunset and ends shortly before sunrise. In summer, activity is less consistently tied to the dark period so that active European Hares can be regularly observed in full daylight. With GPS telemetry, it was possible to gain new knowledge on daily activity patterns of European Hares during summer.

The European Hare is widespread and mostly abundant throughout its distribution. Since 1910, however, populations evidently have decreased throughout Europe due to industrialization of agriculture. The European Hare is listed under Appendix III of the Bern Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats. Several countries have placed the European Hare on their red lists as near threatened or threatened. There is growing concern regarding status of regional forms of the European Hare. A meta-study, reviewing literature from twelve European countries and comparing population densities related to habitat characteristics, concluded that the primary cause of declines of the European Hare was agricultural intensification. Abundance was negatively associated to predation. Field size, temperature, precipitation, and hunting had no effect on densities. In Greece, Spain, France, and Denmark, restocking of European Hares from other regions or countries to supplement densities for hunting has been identified as a threat to regional gene pools. Diseases such as the European Brown Hare Syndrome (EBHS), pasteurellosis, yersiniosis (pseudotuberculosis), coccidiosis, and tularaemia are additional threats because they have been identified as principle causes of mortalities of European Hares in some regions.",Angermann (1972 | 1983 | 2016) | Averianov et al.

Geographically isolated population in Pilbara inhabits the most arid zone in overall distribution.","The Orange Diamond-faced Bat is an aerial hawker and preys on ﬂying insects of various sizes, mainly smaller moths and beetles. Diet composition shows opportunistic prey selection; during wet season, it clearly prefers ﬂying tennites that provide fat-rich diets for pregnant and laetating females. Annually, diet averages 70% moths, 17% beetles, 7% termites (but in December, 056%), 5% ﬂies, and mosquitoes, with occasional ants, wasps, mantises, lacewings, bugs, and cockroaches (representing 1 —2% together). Individuals forage along gorges, ravines, and larger watercourses and in open woodlands and over grassland hills.","The Orange Diamond-faced Bat seasonallv monoestrous. Females give birth to one young in late December or earlyjanuary after ﬁve-month gestation. First three months of pregnancy and sperm production occur during periods of low food availability, and late pregnancy and lactation coincide with maximum food availability. Gestation is prolonged for c.1550 days, although sperm storage and delayed embryonic development have not been observed. Females leave their dry season roosts during late pregnancy and lactation, returning only after young are weaned and independent in late February. This suggests they use separate roosts for birth and rearing of young in wet season. Females are reproductively mature at c.7 months old; males do not mate until 16-18 months old. Males have enlarged testes and mate injuly; mature spermatozoa were observed in testes in April, with increasing numbers up until copulation and declining numbers from August to October; and none were observed in December-March (wet season).","The Orange Diamond-faced Bat is unable to enter torpor and does not hibernate or estivate; remains active year-round and forages in all seasons. lt is strong and highly acrobatic ﬂier; it ﬂies rapidly (up to 26 km h) with fast wingbeats, tends to forage with an erratic ziglagging ﬂight pattem, and remains in ﬂight all the time while foraging. 1 t forages at various heights: low to the ground or water surface at c.0 -1 m, up to the height above tree crowns, and in all stories in between, including understories and tree canopies. When leaving the day roost, ﬂight is most enatic, which is considered anti-predator behavior. It roosts in underground spaces in natural caves, man-made mines, and occasionally buildings. might roost in tree hollows, but this has not been conﬁrmed. Because the Orange Diamond-faced Bat cannot enter torpor, it needs to roost in relatively wann and humid spaces (28-32 C and 85-100% relative humidity) that naturally occur in deep caves or mines. Underground spaces with such conditions are relatively uncommon in most rocky landscapes of north-westem Australia , but in the monsoonal nonh, humid conditions probably allow use of more caves and rarely buildings. Orange Diamond-faced Bats are often seen ﬂying along roads at night. They leave day roost 10-20 minutes after sunset and forage for several hours (mostly 1 -5-4 hours) or the entire night; however, most individuals return to roosts c.2 hours before sunrise. Sometimes, there is a second activity period of 1-2 hours before sunrise. When roosting, they hang freely from the cave ceiling or on cave walls and are separated from each other by 10-15 cm.

During the peak of the dry season (July/August) the depth of the river is dramatically reduced, exposing extensive sandbanks. The Tocantins River, however, is embanked, with relatively clear water, several rapids and a faster current. Botos occurin all habitats in this river, but highest densities occur (both during the seasons of low and falling water) in confluences and bays.","Very little information is available for this species, but accounts of fishermen and observations of Araguaian Botos stealing fish from hooks and nets and pursuing schools of fish in an apparently cooperative way confirm the piscivorous diet of the species, similar to that of the two other species of botos. One study reported three species of fish seen in the mouths of Araguaian Botos: Hydrolycus armatus (Characiformes), and Pimelodus blochii and Oxydoras niger (both Siluriformes) of estimated size of 80 cm, 40 cm, and 60 cm respectively. Large catfish (over 60 cm) were found floating dead with boto teeth marks and missing chunks of the posterior part of the body torn out by botos.","There is no specific information available for this species, but it is likely similar to the Amazon River Dolphin. Lactating females were recorded in the months ofJuly, August, and September without reference to the size of their young. Two halfgrown fetuses were collected in August, several years apart. Apparent neonates have been observed year-round.","There is no specific information available for this species, but due to the strong seasonal variation in the water level, and fish movements during the transition from high to low waters, Araguaian Botos must move from lagoons and flooded areas to main river channels, as do the other species of botos.",,"Because of its recent description, the Araguaian Boto has not yet been formally evaluated on The IUCN Red List. However, due to population-level threats and fragmentation of the population by dams, the species conforms to IUCN criteria designating it as Vulnerable. The Araguaian Boto has a restricted distribution, with fragmented habitat and population, and low population size when compared to the Amazonian River Dolphin. Animal densities of only 0-8-0-98 ind/km* have been reported, and the species appears to have low levels of genetic diversity. In addition to the seven large dams that have been built in the Tocantins River (Tucurui, Luiz Barreto, Lajeado, Peixe Angical, Sao Salvador, Cana Brava, and Serra da Mesa) and two new large dams planned (Serra Quebrada and Maraba) which divide the boto population into nine fragments, agricultural and ranching activities cause cumulative negative effects on several biotic and abiotic aspects of the river basin ecosystem. After 1984, the Tucurui Dam, 11 km long and 78 m high, totally isolated the Araguaian Boto population, stopping its contact with botos from the Para River and estuary about 350 km below. Before the construction of the dam, botos were recorded above and below the rapids and falls that existed in the area, all flooded bythe reservoir. So, potentially, the species can also occur below the Tucurui Dam and its confluence with the Para River to near Soure on the east side of Marajo Island. Recent analysis of mtDNA for a specimen from Para State revealed a different and isolated geographic form of boto, genetically distant from the Amazonian River Dolphin and the Bolivian Boto. In the Tocantins River, the most upstream and southerly records were well above the rapids near Jatobal as well as below and above the hydroelectric dam of Serra da Mesa, near Uruacu and rivers Lajeado and Manoel Alves, among others. In the Araguaia River, the Araguaian Boto has been recorded between the city of Aragarcas/Barra do Garcas and the southern part of Bananal Island past the city of Luis Alves to Santa Isabel rapids and down to Maraba, and in tributaries such as the Formoso, Cristalino, Vermelho, Peixe, Crixas Acu, and Agua Limpa rivers, as well at lakes dos Tigres and Rico in Goias State, up to the confluence with the Tocantins River, and also in Lake Montaria in Mato Grosso State. Interactions with fisheries, including net entanglement and dolphins being shot for taking fish from nets and offlines, result in direct mortality. Anotherthreat is the large concentration oftourists on the Araguaia River from May to October (dry season) when camping facilities are established on riverine sandbanks, motorized boats, and other high-speedvehicles are common, and intensive sport fishing results in botos ingesting hooks and lines.",Araujo (2010) | Araujo & da Silva (2014) | Araujo & Wang (2012) | Best & da Silva (1989a) | do Carmo & da Silva (2010) | Costa et al.

Botos can swim in water shallower than 2 m and come very close to the shore c.1 m depth. Most Amazon River Dolphins live in areas of low gradient, where annual cycles of water depth produce profound habitat changes. For half the year, Amazon River Dolphins have access to vast areas of inundated floodplain, much of it consisting of a complex mosaic of forest, lakes, and channels. This habitat is characterized by low current and high fish density, providing a safe environment, especially for young individuals. Occupied rivers, lakes, and channels vary substantially in character. Some have acidic, black water emanating from flooded forests. Others have clear water originating in geologically old drainage basins. Many have white water laden with sediments from the Andes. Fish communities vary among these ecosystems, but Amazon River Dolphins feed on a wide variety of fish species. Seasonal changes in precipitation and water depth dominate habitats of botos. Major rivers and channels retain adequate water for Amazon River Dolphins throughout the year, but many of the smaller channels and lakes cannot be relied on to retain water in the dry season, so botos and most fish abandon them for several months of the year. The flexible body and broad, rotatable flippers of Amazon River Dolphins, together with the lack of a “normal” falcate dorsal fin, are adaptations for swimming in the tangled vegetation of the flooded forest.","The heterodont (more than one type of tooth) dentition of all three species of botos, unique in cetaceans, allows them to capture and crush armored prey such as armored catfish, crabs, and, on occasion, turtles.

More than 50 fish species, representing more than 20 families, have been found in the stomachs of Amazon River Dolphins in the Central Amazon area, Brazil, including freshwater fish of benthic, littoral, and pelagic habits. Fish of 5-80 cm in length (average c.20 cm) are consumed. Prey diversity is greater at high water levels when botos have access to flooded forests.","Births of botos in Central Amazon, Brazil, occur throughout the year, with a small peak in the low-water season. Length of gestation is not accurately known, but it is probably 11-12 months. Littersize is always one. Neonates are 80-90 cm long and c.10-13 kg at birth. They remain with their mothers for at least two years. Simultaneous pregnancy and lactation are not uncommon, and reproductivciy active mature females spend most of their lives accompanied by a dependent offspring.","There is limited evidence of diurnal activity patterns of Amazon River Dolphins from echolocation click density and movements, but presence or absence of light is arguably unlikely to be of profound importance because botos live in waters where visibility and light penetration are usually very low. Indeed,vision is not essential to their well-being, and a substantial number of healthy botos have opaque eye lenses (cataracts).",,"CITES Appendix I. Classified as Data Deficient on The IUCN Red Lust. Population sizes and trends are inadequately known. The Amazon River Dolphin is distributed throughout most of the Amazon Basin, and it occurs in and near the main stem of the Orinoco River and its largest tributary, the Apure River. It has been reported in smaller rivers of the Orinoco River system and may occur at low densities throughout this basin. Amazon River Dolphins do not occupy salty or brackish waters, but they are tolerant of a wide variety of types of freshwater and habitats. Shallow water, impassable rapids, and availability of food likely limit distribution of the Amazon River Dolphin. Total population size is unknown, but it is likely tens of thousands or more. In the year 2000, 13,000 Amazon River Dolphins were estimated to occur in an area of ¢.11,240 km? in Mamiraua Sustainable Development Reserve in the central Brazilian Amazon. Encounter rates are ¢.0-6 ind/km of waterway, and most botos in the major rivers occur near the margins. Estimated density of Inia in the Amazon River in Colombia (Loretoyacu and Javari rivers) was 1-8 ind/km? in an area of 593 km?, giving a total population estimate of 1115 botos. In Peru, in the Samiria River and a stretch of the Maranon River between the city of Iquitos and the confluence with the Samiria River, densities were 2.7 ind/km? and 5-9 ind/km? in an area of 554 km?, and estimated population size of 917 botos. In the Ecuadorian Amazon, in the rivers Napo, Cuyabeno, Yasuni, Lagartococha, and Aguarico in a surveyed area of 144 km?®, the population size estimate was 147 botos; encounter rates ranged 0-03-0-4 ind/km®. In the Orinoco River estimated density was 1-1 ind/km?* and population size 1779 in a surveyed area of 1684 km. The Amazon River Dolphin has been widespread and abundant, despite loss of many individuals (probably thousands) per year to entanglement and drowning in monofilament gillnets,first introduced in the 1960s and now used by almost every riverside household in the region. Young and juvenile botos were, and remain, especially vulnerable. Since 2000, standardized monitoring of abundance of Amazon River Dolphins in Mamiraua Sustainable Development Reserve detected a marked increase in mortality and the beginning of a steady decline in boto abundance. This coincided with reports of the deliberate killing of botos for use as fish bait. Botos are used as bait to catch an abundant scavenging catfish, the zamurito (Calophysus macropterus, Siluriformes), which is widely distributed in the Amazon River Basin. One person can catch hundreds of catfish in a single night, with no equipment other than a large box to hold the catch and a supply of suitable bait. As stocks of catfish diminished in Colombia, this method offishing was exported downriver into Brazil, and today botos from the Brazilian Amazon are harpooned and often sold specifically for bait in Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, and Brazil. Hunting botos is illegal, clandestine, and almost impossible to quantify. Nevertheless, the approximate size of the catfish catch is known, and calculations of the ratio of botos used per ton of catfish landed, derived from the communities involved, indicates that across its distribution, thousands of Amazon River Dolphins are killed each year in pursuit of this one fishery. In some places, the impact of this hunt on the overall population of Amazon River Dolphins appears to be profound. The hunt continues unabated, and the population continues to decline at an annual rate of ¢.10%. The Amazon River Dolphin is steeped in folklore legends. River-dwelling communities in Brazil fear and revere the Amazon River Dolphin, which is reputed to transform into a man under cover of darkness and seduce women, thereby explaining unexpected pregnancies in human fishing communities. Supposed body parts of Amazon River Dolphins are bought as love charms in Amazonian markets, but DNA analyses have revealed that these are rarely accurately labeled, at least in recent times. Most derive from domestic pigs and sheep, and the Guiana Dolphin (Sotalia guianensis), an ocean dolphin.",Aliaga-Rossel et al.

The elevational range ofthe Aye-aye is from near sea level up to 1875 m.","Diet of the Aye-aye varies by locality and season. It consists mainly ofinsects and their wood-boring larvae, along with hard-shelled fruits, seeds, tree sap, bamboo shoots and pith, flowers, nuts, nectar, honey (obtained by the destruction of active hives), fungus, and eggs. Presence ofthe Aye-aye in some areas appears to be determined by one ofits primary food sources, seeds of “ramy” ( Canarium madagascariense, Burseraceae ). Other dietary staples include seeds of Orania trispatha ( Arecaceae ) and Terminalia catappa ( Combretaceae ); beetle and moth larvae embedded in trees, bamboo, and seeds of Terminalia fruit; cankerous growths on Intsia bijuga ( Fabaceae ); nectar from traveler's palm ( Ravenala madagascariensis , Strelitziaceae ); and crops such as coconuts, lychees, sugar cane, and mangos. Crop damage by Aye-ayes can be considerable; in one case, they destroyed 80-100% ofthe coconut crop in two villages. Aye-ayes spend most oftheir active hours foraging for insect larvae. Using their oversized, highly sensitive ears, they intently listen for sounds oftheir quarry tunneling within the wood and simultaneously tap the surface of the bark with their fingers to trace hollow pathways. When a grub is located, the Aye-aye usesits long front teeth to gouge a hole in the wood and then extracts the grub with its wiry middle finger. The same basic technique is used to get at the insides of coconuts and eggs and even while drinking, using the finger to draw water to the mouth. This movement of the third finger from the food or water to the mouth can be extraordinarily rapid; it has been measured at a rate of3-3 strokes/second. They are extremely noisy eaters. Captive individuals have been known to hide coconuts.","The Aye-aye breeds throughout the year. Females have a regular monthly cycle, which lasts, on average, 47 days in captivity. They have an externally visible genital swelling, and the vulva changes color in estrus. Full estrus lasts 3-9 days. In the wild, swollen genitalia and an increase in scent marking have been observed in both sexes before and during mating activity. The solicitation posture of a captive female consists ofplacing herselfsideways next to a male and then turning her head toward him. Other methods offemale solicitation include vocalizations and running up to the male, touching faces, and then running away. Females are polyandrous; they mate with more than one male during a single estrus. As many as six males will group around a female and aggressively interact for access to her. Although copulation is quick in captivity (generally lasting about two minutes), it lasts for about one hour in the wild—possibly a consequence of mate-guarding by a male to prevent access by other males. Males attempt to disrupt copulation to mate with her themselves. They copulate suspended from a branch, with the female holding on to the branch and the male grasping only the female. After copulating, the pair may groom each other, or the female may move away quickly and resume calling. The reproductive rate of Aye-ayes is low, a single young born about every 2-3 years. Births may take place at any time of the year, but they usually occur in February or March after a gestation of 164-172 days. The newborn spends the first couple of months at or near the nest. The mother carries it in her mouth and will often “park”it in a nest while she forages. Infants have green eyes for the first nine weeks, after which they become brown. Ears are floppy for the first six months or so, and the fur on the face, shoulders, and belly is paler than that of adults. They begin to eat solid foods at about three months of age. Play is very important for the young. Full independence appears to occur when they are 18 months to two years old. Females typically begin to reproduce at about 3-5 years old, and males will start copulating (though not successfully) at 2-5 years old. Age of dispersal is unknown. Individuals have lived up to 24 years in captivity.","Nocturnal and mainly arboreal. Aye-ayes sleep generally rolled up into a ball with the tail wrapped over the body, during the day in tree forks, vine tangles, or their large bowl-shaped nests. They emerge from the nest as early as 30 minutes before sunset and may not return to until after sunrise. Males become active earlier than females. Over the course of the night, more than 50% of an Aye-aye’s timeis spent moving, interspersed with bouts of feeding, grooming, and resting. When they rest, they remain sedentary but are fully aware of their surroundings and not asleep. These rest periods can last for as long as two hours. Individuals groom themselves several times during the night in bouts lasting up to 30 minutes—the longer the session, the higher in the canopy they perch, presumably for safety. The long, narrow third finger is used for combing, scratching, and cleaning the fur; the other fingers are flexed during these behaviors.",,"CITES Appendix I. Classified as Near Threatened on The IUCN Red List. However, at the JUCN/SSC Lemur Red-Listing Workshop held in July 2012, the Aye-aye was assessed as endangered due to an inferred and projected ongoing and future population decline of more than 50% over three generations. The Ayeaye is still killed in some areas as a harbinger of evil and a crop pest (e.g. coconuts), and they are hunted for food. Habitat destruction also threatens them throughout their range, with trees such as Intsia bijuga and Canarium madagascariense—dietary staples—preferentially harvested for construction of boats, houses, and coffins. Aye-ayes are known to occur in twelve national parks (Andohahela, Andringitra, Mananara-Nord, Mantadia, Marojejy, Masoala, Midongy du Sud, Montagne d’Ambre, Ranomafana, Sahamalaza-Iles Radama, Tsingy de Bemaraha, and Tsingy de Namoroka), three strict nature reserves (Betampona, Tsaratanana, and Zahamena), and 13 special reserves (Ambatovaky, Analamazaotra, Analamerana, Anjanaharibe-Sud, Ankarana, Bora, Foret d’Ambre, Kalambatritra, Manombo, Manongarivo, Marotandrano, Nosy Mangabe, and Pic d’Ivohibe). Theyalso are found in the forests of Daraina (part of the Loky-Manambato protected area) and Maroala and Anjiamangirana classified forests. Despite occurring in many protected areas, their presence is often based only on signs and infrequent sightings, and little is known about their population sizes and dynamics. There is an urgent need for a systematic census of this important flagship species throughout its range, with the ultimate goal of developing a conservation action plan. In the mid-1990s, the total world population was estimated at 1000-10,000.",Albignac (1987) | Ancrenaz et al.

In the Alps, the West European Hedgehog occurs up to elevations of 2000 m but does not live above tree line. It generally does not enter extensive coniferous forests because oflack of ground cover. It is common in parks, gardens, and golf courses, and it seems to favor edge habitats between open and more densely vegetated areas. Rocky outcrops and piles of rocks can serve as shelters. Populations in cultivated areas are small or lacking where removal of hedgerows and use ofpesticides have reduced cover and amounts ofinvertebrate prey. It may move ontoirrigatedfields in dry years.","The West European Hedgehog is omnivorous but primarily eats invertebrates such as beetles, larvae, slugs, worms, andspiders. It also eats fruits, fungi, and small vertebrates including frogs, snakes, lizards, young birds, eggs, mice, and carrion. It has been reported to congregate around gardens and vineyards to feed on snakes. It commonly eats millipedes and carabid beetles, which use distasteful and noxious substances in defense. Some other distasteful species such as woodlice, staphylinid beetles, and some ladybird beetles seem to be avoided. It enjoys bread and milk, pet food, and kitchen scraps offered by humans. When foraging, it generally progresses slowly and pauses briefly to sniff the air or ground. It also will forage in a more rapid andlinear style whereit covers much more ground but still searches for suitable prey. The West European Hedgehog always is alert and constantly sniffing and listening. Prey likely are detected mainly by their odor, but sound also is important in finding prey. Prey items usually are snapped up rapidly, anditems buried in litter, grass, or soil are quickly rooted out. Males tend to travel faster than females while foraging, and both sexes travel fastest in short grass and progressively slower as density of cover increases.","The West European Hedgehog is believedto be polygynous, but multiple paternities oflitters indicate that at least some individuals practice polyandry. There usually are two breeding seasons each year, and they vary geographically. In Scandinavia, breeding occurs in May to mid-July, and in England, pregnancies occur in May-October, with peaks in May-July and September. Later mating generally occurs ifthe first litter is lost or aborted. Rate ofgrowth ofyoung borntolate litters is faster than for young bornto early litters. There is no difference in rate of growth between sexes. Sexual cycle of males varies regionally. During breeding season, reproductive organs of males increase to 10%ofbody weight. Gestation lasts 31-35 days, but some estimates are up to 42 days. Litters have 4-7 young (range 1-11). Reports of conjoined twins are rare. Young are born in nests ofleaves. Neonates are nearly hairless, eyes are closed, length is ¢.70 mm, and weights are 8-25 g depending onsize oflitter. Young are born with soft whitish spines that harden and begin to be replaced by adult-type spines at","The West European Hedgehog is predominantly nocturnal, resting by day under piles of brush or in leaf nests in rocky crevices and burrows. Activity during midday often indicates that an individual is sick, but healthy individuals can be active during the day, particularly in autumn. Some lactating females can be almost as active during day as at night during summer, some individuals tend to emerge before sunset, and some retire to their nest well after dawn. Usual gait is slow, meandering walk that frequently is punctuated by short bursts of speed up to 50-120 m/minute. Males usually move at an average speed of 3-7 m/minute, females at 2:2 m/minute, and subadults at 2:2 m/minute. The West European Hedgehog lives on the surface ofthe ground without extensively burrowing or climbing. It is a good climber, and spines, besides serving as protection from predators, act as a cushion when it falls or drops from a height. It is a good swimmer but might not be able to escape from steepsided garden pools. It hibernates from about October to early April in colder parts ofits distribution, but individuals become active, emerge, and move to another nest 2-3 times in winter. Hibernation bouts last 5-27 days (average nine days). Some nests are repaired and re-used, and others are abandoned. Nests may be occupied, then abandoned for up to four months, and later re-occupied.

In the Middle Atlas Range of Morocco, the North African Hedgehog occurs up to elevations of ¢.2000 m. It reportedly does not inhabit arid deserts, but it has been documented at oases in the Sahara Desert up to 500 km south of coastal Algeria. It seems to do well in areas inhabited by humans such as fallow or cultivated fields, palm groves, almond and olive plantations, hedges, woodlands, and suburban gardens. In Spain, it occupied open grass-scrub areas and used fields when available, butit avoided forests and urban areas.","The North African Hedgehog is primarily insectivorous and opportunistic. Diet includes fungi, worms, eggs,fruits, snails, insects, other invertebrates, small vertebrates, and carrion. In Algeria, diet included c.85% insects (mostly ants and beetles), 6% centipedes and millipedes, 5% spiders, 2% gastropods, and 1% crustaceans (isopods). On the Balearic Islands, diet contained snails, centipedes, insects, some small vertebrates (snakes, lizards, and frogs), and a truffle-like fungus. On the Canary Islands,it ate berries, corn, and pumpkins. Results of laboratory studies revealed that color of eggs did not influence rates of consumption of eggs, but size of eggs was important. North African Hedgehogs preferred to consume smaller eggs (quail) more than intermediate-sized eggs (partridge), and large eggs (chicken) were not consumed at all.","Reproduction of the North African Hedgehog appears limited to spring and summer. In Libya, breeding occurs in April-June, and occasionally a secondlitter is produced in July. On the Balearic Islands, breeding season occurs in June-October, with mostlitters born from the second half ofJuly through the first half of September. Gestation lasts 30-48 days. Litters have 1-7 young. Young remain close to their mother for several months.","North African Hedgehogs are nocturnal. In Algeria, males were first observed dead on roads in spring from March onward. During this time, more males (45%) than females (31%) were found dead. High level of activity of males in spring (maximum in May) and summer coincides with breeding. Most juveniles were found dead on roads in late summer and early autumn (24%), corresponding to dispersal and foraging in preparation for winter. In late autumn,activity begins to decrease and becomes more reduced in winter, apparently to save energy during cold weather. In winter, North African Hedgehogs probably reduce their metabolism and hibernate. Day-resting sites are spherical structures that can be constructed offoliage, herbaceous vegetation, and human-made waste (e.g. plastic strings from nearby crops). These dayresting sites can be under dense vegetation on margins of cultivated crops and in giant canes, open-vegetated areas, buildings (farm sheds, retaining walls, or houses), and piles of logs or wooden boxes.",,"Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. Humans introduced the North African Hedgehog in Menorca during the 13™ century, continental Spain about 3000 years ago, and the Canary Islands in 1892. European populations have declined, and it has disappeared in some places where it occurred in past decades, including southern France where it might be extinct. Loss and fragmentation of habitats are the possible causes of declines in Europe. The North African Hedgehog is a regular victim of traffic on roads in all parts ofits distribution, especially during breeding in spring and summer. Cattle grids, which are designed to restrict movements of livestock, are hazardous to hedgehogs because they can fall into them and are not able to escape. These grids often are used on narrow roadways with grassy borders and hedges, which are preferred habitats of hedgehogs in rural pasturelands.

The Four-toed Hedgehog lives in areas with dry soils and is absent from deserts, marshes, and dense forests. It seems to be drawn to relatively open, dry, or seasonal habitats, with sparse or patchy grasses, especially overgrazed areas with dense populations of ungulates where there is an abundance of trampled herbage and dung to support termites and other insects.","The Four-toed Hedgehog is omnivorous. It will eat fungi and plant material such as fallen fruits, roots, and groundnuts, but it primarily preys upon invertebrates, especially termites, beetles, earthworms, millipedes, ants, grasshoppers, slugs, snails, and crabs. It also eats small vertebrates including snakes, lizards, frogs, and young and eggs of ground-nesting birds. It usually forages alone and hunts mainly by scent. It will dig for prey in soft, loose soils. Hearing and sight also are involved with searching for food. Immobile foods are toyed with before being ingested, and mobile prey is snapped up and chewed noisily. Lizards and mice are seized and shaken to death. Snakes are approached with caution and are bitten severely and repeatedly while the Four-toed Hedgehog protects its face with spines to avoid being struck;it will continue the attack until it has broken the spine or eviscerated the snake. It readily consumes carrion and will scavenge road kills at night.","Times of reproductive activity of the Fourtoed Hedgehog vary in different parts of its distribution, but it is sexually active throughout the year in central and northern Africa. Farther south in Zambia and Zimbabwe, it breeds seasonally. Courtship is ritualistic. When a female is in search of a mate, she calls with a whine. Males serenade females during courtship with bird-like call of repeated squeaks that vary greatly from almost a whistle to a coarse squawk. Males court females by persistently following them. Male walks around a female in estrus with his snout pointed toward her and puffing; this may last for several days. When the male approaches, the female reacts aggressively by raising her spines and snorting. She respondsto a serenading male by vigorously butting him as she hisses and snorts, and she rejects him by running away, by pushing him on his flank with spines on her head, and with other evasive moves. Such behavior can last for hours. Copulation occurs when the male mounts the female from behind after she has flattened her spines, lowered her abdomen to the ground, and pressed her hindquarters outward. The male has an especially long penis, which might be because spines on the rump of the female prevent the male from getting too close to her during copulation. Gestation lasts 35-37 days. Young are born during any month in central and northern Africa, but in southern areas, young are born during warm and wet months, mainly October—March. In Zambia and Zimbabwe, young are born in November, ¢.2 months after females emerge from estivation. Nests are in well-hidden cavities, lined with vegetative material. After parturition, the female licks the young, eats the afterbirth, and places young on her abdomen to nurse. Young vigorously search for a nipple; after nursing begins, swallowing noises and motion of the throat are apparent. Litters usually have 3-5 young (range 1-10). Young are altricial and nearly hairless, eyes and ears are closed, they weigh ¢.10 g (range 8-13 g), they are 20-26 mm long, and their spines are pliable for the first few daysafter birth. Neonatal mortality is high due to desertion and cannibalism by mothers. Young grow rapidly; they weigh 25 g by day 7, 50 g by day 13, 70-75 g by day 20, 110-120 g by day 28, 130-150 g by day 34, and 170-190 g by day 40. Young huddle together, especially during periods of inactivity. Legs are thin and fragile, and feet are formed with nails intact. Young exhibit boxing, hissing, self-anointing, and anti-predator behaviors before their eyes open. Eyes open at 14-15 days. Deciduous teeth erupt at c.3 weeks, permanent teeth at 7-9 weeks, and consumption ofsolid food begins at ¢.24 days. Young typically are weaned by 4-6 weeks of age when they weigh 170-195 g; then, they begin to accompany their mother and typically leave her by c.7 weeks of age. In captivity, sexual maturity is attained as early as 61 days, but in the wild,it is reached at c.1 year of age. Females can give birth several times each year. There is no record of a reproductively active, captive-born female more than two years of age. Only one wild-caught female that was in the lab for 33 months was able to reproduce longer; females in the wild probably are reproductively active for an even shorter time.","The Four-toed Hedgehog is predominantly nocturnal, but it can be both crepuscular and nocturnalto avoid daytime heat and desiccation. In captivity, two peaks of activity are evident: 21:00-24:00 h and ¢.03:00 h. It rests by day curled up in a ball or reclined full-length under rocks, logs, or matted grass or in leaflitter, termitarium, rocky crevice, or hole in the ground. Such refuges change daily unless they are being used to rear young or as a hibernation site. During warm rainy season when food is abundant, the Four-toed Hedgehog gains weight and enters torpor when weather is cool and dry. In southern Africa, hibernation takes place in June-September, with individuals remaining torpid for up to six weeks and emerging during warm intervals. In some parts ofits distribution,it probably does not hibernate. The Four-toed Hedgehog can climb and swim; it typically moves slowly butis capable of bursts of speed.",,"Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. In eastern Africa, many superstitions surround the Four-toed Hedgehog. Its skin or spines often are used as fertility charms. In Uganda and Kenya, a bumper harvestis believed to be obtained by placing skin of a hedgehog on seeds before sowing, and for maximum yields of cotton, its skin should be burned on the cotton field. Humans eatit as bushmeat. In Nigeria, holes where it lives are located, and they are captured by digging, pouring water into the hole, or filling the hole with smoke.

It does not seem to be dependent on free water.","The Southern African Hedgehog is polygynous. Testosterone levels are high in September—January and low in February—June, and testicular activity resumesat the end of winter (July-August) when individuals are still experiencing bouts of torpor. It hibernates in June-August or September. Nothing is known about breeding season in more arid regions to the south and west. In precopulatory encounters, the male approaches the female who huffs and puffs and jerks her body in rejection, always on the move. During copulation, the female might move about, huffing and puffing, as if trying to get rid of the male who has a bite-hold of quills on her lower back. He thrusts and moves with the female on his hindlegs, his forepaws pushing on her back. His penis appears locked inside the female who might fall over several times, but mating continues while lying on their side. Upon termination of copulation, the female moves off while the male remains behind. Gestation lasts 35-42 days. Young are born during warm-wet summers, usually in October—-March but sometimes as late as April. Females give birth in sheltered nests in debris or in holes lined with dry leaves. The Southern African Hedgehog sometimes uses termitaria for nesting. Males do not participate in parental care. Litters usually have 4-5 young (range 1-10); litters with 8-9 young are common. Sizes of neonates are head-body lengths of 50-53 mm,tail lengths of 4-5 mm, and weights of 9-12 g. Neonates have eyes and ears closed, their body is pink and hairless, and they actively crawl about. Rudimentary spines are visible beneath the skin. Within 1-3 hours after birth, tips of unpigmented spines emerge through the skin. Actively flexing after birth probably assists in forcing quills through the skin. After 2-3 hours, spines average 3-8 mm long. After a day, spines have grown to 4-9-5-5 mm long. In three days, pigmented spines appear, and in seven days, distinctly hedgehog-like appearance is attained, along with characteristic frowning, puffing, and jerking. Eyes open at 10-14 days old. Spines of infants are shed at 4-6 weeks. Weight at weaning is ¢.200 g. Young are weaned and begin to accompany the mother at c.5-6 weeks. Sexual maturity can be reached as soon as 9-10 weeks after birth. Females can become pregnant during their first year so that parturition takes place during favorable summer conditions. One captive Southern African Hedgehog produced a litter at 13 months old. Females can produce more than onelitter each year.","The Southern African Hedgehog is predominantly nocturnal and usually emerges in evening to forage but exhibits some diurnal activity following rainfall, probably to feed on emerging earthworms. It generally moves about slowly but is capable of remarkable bursts of speed. It rests by day curled up in a ball under matted grass or in leaf litter, rocky crevice, or hole in the ground. Such resting sites are changed daily unless they are being used to rear young or for hibernation. During warm rainy season when food is abundant, it gains weight. In cool, dry winter when availability of food declines and ambient temperatures decrease, the Southern African Hedgehog becomes scarce and burrows into loose sandy soil to hibernate. Hibernation is characterized by low oxygen consumption, low respiratory rate, and lowered body temperature. During this time, fat reserves accumulated in wet season are used to obtain energy. It appears that it can modify length of torpor in response to availability of food and energy. Hibernation is in June-September and is slightly less in northern parts ofits distribution. It remains torpid for up to six weeks at a time and temporarily arouses during warm weather. Torpor ends when temperatures increase in spring. Both sexes can lose c¢.15% of their weight during three months in hibernation.",,"Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. The Southern African Hedgehog is considered rare in South Africa, and populations have declined because of popularity as a pet, use as food by humans, mortalities on roadways, use of domestic and agricultural pesticides (these kill prey), climate changes, and loss",Apps (2012) | Beer (2003) | van der Colf & van Aarde (1992) | Dippenaar & Baxter (2013a) | Ellerman et al.

Females can produce up to four litters each year, with peaks in February-March and June. It nests in clumps of vegetation or uses burrows under shrubs or among rocks. The Desert Hedgehog does not line its nest; a female gave birth to one young in a sand and peat hollow, making no use of hay, wood shavings, and leaves that were available. Gestation lasts 34-46 days. Litters have 2-7 young. Neonates weigh 6-9 g. Weight at ten days of age is 20 g, 20 days is 40 g, 30 days is 60 g, 40 days is 80 g, and 60 daysis 150 g.

The Common Long-eared Hedgehog is not desert adapted, but it is moderately tolerant of heat and drought, and its large ears might be important in thermoregulation. It is rare in sparsely vegetated areas. It favors mesic sites such as suburban parks and gardens, olive groves, and agricultural lands and is commonly associated with humans. In Pakistan,it is plentiful above elevations of 900 m and can occur in valleys up to 2500 m. In Iran, it spends days in shallow burrows, beneath mud walls, or in piles of hay. In Egypt, it often is in buildings, crevices in walls, piles of bricks and stones, fissures in rocks, small caves, graveyards, and burrows of the Fat Sand Rat (Psammomys obesus) in salt-marsh habitats. It selects soft ground such as sandy dunes where it can dig relatively deep burrows that slope at a slight angle.","The Common Long-eared Hedgehog is omnivorous,it is a voracious feeder, and it can survive for up to ten weeks without eating or drinking. Diet primarily is insects (bugs, beetles, grasshoppers, termites, lepidopterans, ants), but it also eats other invertebrates (worms, millipedes, and snails), small vertebrates (mammals, birds, snakes, and lizards), eggs, carrion, fruits, and seeds. It seems immune to poisons and stings of insects and other invertebrates and will hunt and eat scorpions, venomous spiders, and stinging hymenopterans. It will kill and eat small snakes, some venomous, by rolling into a ball after grabbing the lower body of the snake so that the snake strikes in vain against the spines, often damaging itself. The Common Longeared Hedgehog feeds on grapes, mulberries, and watermelons, which it hollows out. It does not eat food discarded by humans, and captive individuals show a tendency toward cannibalism. Even with its protective spines,it is an important source of food for carnivores.","The Common Long-eared Hedgehog is polygynous. Breeding probably occurs immediately after emerging from hibernation in early spring (mid-April) and continues into late summer (September). Courtship behavior is well developed and includes sniffing, licking genitalia, and flank rubbing. Male copulates by standing almost vertically on his hindlegs, while the female lies on her abdomen with hindlegs extended. Gestation lasts 28-42 days. Births peak in July-September. Before giving birth, females excavate nest chamber in their burrow. Apparently, they clear all debris from the floor of the nest chamber, they do not line the chamber, they give birth on the smooth floor, and they lick neonates until they are clean. Litters vary geographically but usually have 3-5 young (range 1-7). Neonates are born naked, except for some scattered spines. They weigh 7-13 g, body length is 47-61 mm, hindfoot length is 7 mm, and ear length is 3-4 mm. Their backs are thickly covered with spines by 14 days old, eyes open at 15-20 days, solid food is eaten at 21-28 days, teeth appear at 23-24 days, weaning is at ¢.31-40 days, and young leave nest at ¢.30-40 days. There is no evidence that more than one litter is produced each year. Young can reach sexual maturity as soon as six weeks of age. Longevity is 6-7 years.","The Common Long-eared Hedgehog is nocturnal and begins foraging early in the evening. Day-resting sites usually are in burrows that are under small shrubs or bushes. Burrows are 20-150 cm long and have a single opening. Rest sites occur in caves and crevices and under piles of rocks and bricks. Long limbs enable it to walk and run quickly. It is an active digger and will excavate its own burrow when abandoned dens made by rodents or other mammals are not available. Generally, it excavates burrows under large rocks and can dig in sandy, clay, or rocky soils. Digging employs broad-clawed forefeet to loosen and throw soil backward; snout is not used in digging. The Common Long-eared Hedgehog periodically moves backward up its burrow and kicks out accumulated soil using hindfeet. In firm soil, 30-38cm burrows are completed in 3-4 hours. In soft soil,it can dig a 10cm hole in five minutes and can dig several burrows each night. It enters and exits burrows headfirst. Females widen ends of burrows to accommodate young. During early spring when insects and other invertebrates are plentiful, it builds up a layer offat. It can enter torpor in any season during droughts, shortages of food, and cold or hot weather, and it can remain partially awake, or sufficiently conscious, to react quickly to any disturbance. Even during short periods of torpor and estivation, respiration is slow and shallow, and heart rate decreases. Body temperature usually remains within 1-2°C of ambient temperatures. In regions where temperatures in winter are as cold as —6-5°C, body temperature during hibernation can approach 0°C. In North Africa, it can enter torpor during the cold season (December—February) and remain in its burrow 5-40 days. In northern India, it might hibernate up to 3-5 months in winter, and in the mountains of Pakistan, hibernation occurs in October-March and can be 5-5-6 months. In China, it enters torpor in October and emerges in spring. During hibernation, the Common Longeared Hedgehog wakes up periodically and might emerge briefly to forage or move only within its nesting burrow. In warmer areas, there is no prolonged hibernation in winter.",,"Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. The Common Long-eared Hedgehog is common in much ofits broad distribution.

The Indian Long-eared Hedgehog tends to avoid hot, dry deserts.","The Indian Long-eared Hedgehog is omnivorous and will grab and eat any prey that it can overcome. When foraging,it takes short, rapid steps and appears to depend primarily on scent to locate food. It sniffs with its snout in roots of grass or leaflitter in search of insect larvae. Venomous snakes are grabbed anywhere on the body, and with spines erect and head lowered,it keepsits face partially concealed so that the reptile strikes against spines and injures itself. When an Indian Longeared Hedgehog seizes a snake or limb of a large animal, it will roll itself into a ball and begin chewing on the held portion. Diet primarily contains insects, especially dung beetles and orthopterans (mole crickets, crickets, and grasshoppers), but other insects and arthropods; earthworms; small vertebrates including frogs, toads, lizards, snakes, eggs and nestlings of ground-dwelling birds, and small mammals; carrion; and fruit also are eaten. Cannibalism is common. Females will eat their offspring, and males will attack and eat any young they encounter.","In India, breeding occurs in June-September, which is between extreme heat in May-June and cooler weather in December—January. Young benefit from increased availability of food following monsoons in July-August. Similarly, in Pakistan, mostlitters are born August-September at the height of the monsoon when insect prey is most abundant. The male copulates by standing almost vertically on his hindlegs, while the female lies on her abdomen with hindlegs extended on the ground. Gestation probably lasts 30-40 days. Young are born in burrows. If natal burrow is disturbed, the mother will abandon it. Young are transported by the mother only at night. To carry them, she grasps loose skin on the neck or side with her mouth. Litters average 2-3 young (range is 1-6). A litter of four young was born over a five-hour period. Neonates have closed eyes and seem to locate their mother by smell. Nursing occurs with the mother lying on her side, and infants knead mammae with their forefeet and suck loudly. Neonates average 8:3 g, are 47 mm long, and are nearly hairless, except for scattered spines that are 2 mm long, whitish, and soft. Within c.5 hours of birth spines have grown to ¢.8 mm and begin to darken but are still soft. When c.5 days old, numerous pigmented spines are visible, and by the time young are two weeks old, their back is thickly covered with spines. Young do not leave nest burrows until! four weeks old, after which they accompany their mothers","In summer,the Indian Long-eared Hedgehog escapes intense desert heat by being strictly nocturnal in foraging activity. It emerges at dusk and forages for 5-6 hours. When food is plentiful, it returns to its burrow by about midnight and does not emerge again until the following evening. It is an active digger and excavatesits own burrows. Opening of burrow is entirely or partially concealed under a bush, and if the ground is hard,it can be short, extending no more than 30 cm. In softsandy soil, the burrow can be 150 cm deep. Burrow terminates in slightly wider chamber that is unlined. An individual that descends head first into and out ofits burrow can turn around inside the small chamber. Burrow usually slopes down to ¢.30-35 cm below the surface and will be used by the same individual for an entire year.",,Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List.

In linear sand dune country, Central Desert Marsupial Moles appear to favor dune flanks and crests and avoid the hard loamy sediments of the dune swales. On the western margin ofits distribution, in the vicinity of the Warburton Range, the Central Desert Marsupial Mole may occur in regional sympatry or syntopy with the Northwestern Marsupial Mole.","Information on the diet of the Central Desert Marsupial Mole comes from attempts to maintain them in captivity and from analysis of gut contents of museum specimens. Captive individuals have accepted numerous food items including eggs, larvae, and pupae of various insect species including ants and termites, earthworms, centipedes, spiders, and gekkonid lizards. Larvae of longicorn beetles ( Cerambycidae ) and scarab beetles ( Scarabaeidae ), moths (Lepidoptera), and commercial mealworms (larvae of Tenebrio molitor , Tenebrionidae ) have been acceptable food items, but adult beetles seem to be rejected. B. Spencer reported his captive Central Desert Marsupial Moles fed readily on ant eggs, larvae, and pupae, but he postulated that adult ants are ingested coincidentally. F. Wood Jones found earthworms ( Lumbricus sp. , Lumbricidae ) to be acceptable to captive Central Desert Marsupial Moles, but others have had the opposite experience. At any rate, earthworms are not usually available in the sandy desert environment occupied by Central Desert Marsupial Moles. There are no observations of feeding above ground by free-living Central Desert Marsupial Moles. Captive individuals will sometimes feed above ground, but they more often grasp large prey items in the mouth and burrow underground to consume them. Small food items like ant or termite eggs are simply licked from the surface, but larger items may be held down or sometimes suspended by forelimbs while they are grasped in the mouth or chewed. Reduction of large food items appears to take place through progressive reduction in the posterior premolar and molar region, and there is no attempt to tear off pieces of food. Gut contents of Central Desert Marsupial Moles have contained a variety of invertebrate prey items and some plant material, most often grass seeds. A specimen examined by C. Brazenor in the mid-1950s contained burrowing sawfly larvae ( Pergidae ), ants of the genus Rhytidoponera ( Ectatomminae ), and legs of leaf beetles ( Chrysomelidae ). K. Winkel and I. Humphrey-Smith examined ten specimens of Central Desert Marsupial Moles and found remains of adult predatory ants (/ridomyrmex spp., Dolichoderinae ), seed-eating ants ( Myrmeciinae ), and their eggs, larvae, and pupae. Grass seeds were also present, but these may have been ingested accidentally from underground caches maintained by Myrmeciinae . More recently, C. Pavey and coworkers examined gut contents of 16 Central Desert Marsupial Moles and compared prey abundances in soil cores taken on sand ridges in the general region of original capture. Five insect orders ( Coleoptera , Hymenoptera, Isoptera, Lepidoptera, and Orthoptera ) were represented in gut samples, along with scorpions, spiders, and plant material. Two main prey types were dominant: social insects (ants and termites) and larvae of beetles. Ants, termites, and beetle larvae also dominated samples obtained in soil cores. Termites alone were potentially underrepresented in gut contents compared with their natural frequency. Results suggest that the Central Desert Marsupial Mole is a dietary generalist despite its specialized adaptations for a subterranean lifestyle.","Instances of single and twin pouch young have been recorded for the Central Desert Marsupial Mole. Although only two teats are present in the pouch, the uterus of one pregnant female contained six subterminal fetuses along with two degenerating blastocysts, suggesting a degree of embryonic wastage that is unusual among Australian marsupials. Otherwise, there is no information on timing of mating, duration of pregnancy, and processes of birth and development of the Central Desert Marsupial Mole.","There has been much speculation regarding timing and environmental correlates of surfacing behavior of the Central Desert Marsupial Mole, but none of the hypotheses are supported by any field data. Surfacing may take place primarily in the evening when soil surface temperatures are dropping but before night air temperatures fall dramatically. Some individuals located on the surface during the day seem to have been moribund while others may have been forced to the surface by high groundwater after flooding. Otherwise, nothing is known about activity patterns of free-living Central Desert Marsupial Moles.",,"Classified as Data Deficient on The IUCN Red List. In a recent assessment, A. Burbidge and coworkers in 2014 recommend a conservation status of Least Concern for the Central Desert Marsupial Mole. There are recent records from several localities in central Australia and one from the Great Victoria Desert. Burrows of Central Desert Marsupial Moles have been found in many more localities, but it is unclear how populated somesites are and how long these burrows may persist within the soil profile.",Bennison et al.

The North-western Marsupial Mole has been collected at fewer than 15 localities in Gibson, Little Sandy, and Great Sandy deserts of Western Australia; however, information from Aboriginal informants suggests a much broader distribution that probably takes in ¢.30% of the land area of Western Australia—a huge and largely unpopulated area. At the south-eastern extremity of its distribution,in the vicinity of the Warburton Range, the North-western Marsupial Mole may occur in regional sympatry or syntopy with the Central Desert Marsupial Mole.","The diet of the North-western Marsupial Mole has not been studied either in the field or from examination of gut contents. A captive individual held in the laboratory of P. Withers of the University of Western Australia initially proved difficult to maintain, although it later seemed to feed avidly on large insect larvae collected from the stems of dead grass trees (Xanthorrhoea sp., Xanthorrhoeaceae ). Mealworm larvae ( Tenebrio molitor , Tenebrionidae ) were refused. The individual inexplicably stopped eating and died after five weeks in captivity.","There is no specific information available for this species, but if the specimen in the South Australian Museum from Sturt Creek in Western Australia is a Northwestern Marsupial Mole, then it provides a record of twin pouch young.","The only information on activity patterns of the North-western Marsupial Mole comes from observations on a single captive individual that was maintained for five weeks. Its general behavior conformed to reports on captive Central Desert Marsupial Moles. Whether above or below the surface, it alternated between bouts of frenetic activity and periods of immobility during which it appeared to be asleep. When brought to the surface, it usually burrowed again rapidly.",,"Classified as Data Deficient on The IUCN Red List. A recent assessment by A. Burbidge and coworkers in 2014 recommends a conservation status of Least Concern. Each known locality for the North-western Marsupial Mole has yielded only 1-2 specimens, and there is nothing to match the large singlelocality samples available for the Central Desert Marsupial Mole. While this might reflect a genuine ecological contrast in abundances between the two species,it is more prudent to conclude that it represents circumstances of collecting. All capture records of North-western Marsupial Moles since 1990 come from localities in the north-western part of its distribution. This is an area of active resource development, and several North-western Marsupial Moles have been uncovered during road construction.",Benshemesh (2004) | Benshemesh & Aplin (2008) | Benshemesh & Burbidge (2008) | Burbidge & Aplin (1996) | Burbidge et al.

In South Africa , the percentage occurrence of food items in 21 stomachs was 62% insects, 38% mammals, 10% birds, 10% arachnids, 5% frogs, and 5% myriapods. In the Cape Province , stomachs contained birds, mammals, reptiles, and insects (Coleoptera, Coleoptera larvae, Orthoptera, Lepidoptera, and Diptera). One stomach from Kalahari National Park, South Africa , contained mostly reptile remains. In Botswana , twelve stomachs contained insects, reptiles, and small mammals. Most prey are detected by sight or smell, and captured after stalking or short chases. Larger mammals, such as ground squirrels (Xerus) and spring hares, are followed to their burrows and killed. Zorillas often hunt for invertebrates in loose soil, plant debris, and at the base of grass tufts. Typically, a Zorilla pushesits nose into loose soil and sniffs audibly. When food is detected,it is excavated with the forefeet. Slow prey are bitten directly, whereas faster-moving prey, such as moths, mantids, or beetles, may either be bitten or pinned to the ground with a forefoot and eaten head first. All parts of insects are eaten. Rats (Rattus) are located mainly by sight. On occasion, rats are stalked and quickly captured or are chased. They are captured either by direct biting or by being pinned to the ground with the forefeet and then bitten. Mostkilling bites are directed at the back of the neck, head, or chest. Rats larger than 140 g usually require more bites and pinning with the forefeet. Occasionally, Zorillas roll while biting. Large rats are eaten by biting at the flesh and holding the skin with the forefeet. Birds presented to captive Zorillas are quickly and easily killed by a bite at the head, and then eaten head first. Zorillas will consume young birds completely, but they leave most ofthe feathers, feet, and tibia of mature birds. The contents of broken eggs are readily consumed, but captive Zorillas experience initial difficulty with unbroken eggs. Eventually, they learn to open them by biting or rolling the egg against a hard object such as a rock. Once cracked, the egg is easily opened and consumed. Zorillas will kill snakes and can attack large cobras. Snakes are approached cautiously and bitten on the back several times, after which the Zorilla retreats rapidly. Each bite is directed to the posterior half of the snake and is accompanied by vigorous shaking. After four or five such attacks, the Zorilla pins the snake to the ground with the forefeet, and repeatedly bites 10-15 cm from the head. Some of the bites involve vigorous shaking. Most snakes are eaten head first, but occasionally the tail or even flanks may be consumed first. Lizards are captured following short chases, pinned to the ground with the forefeet, and killed by a bite at the head. Lizards are entirely consumed and eaten head first. Amphibians are pinned to the ground with the forefeet and killed by biting the head and neck region; all parts of amphibians are eaten.","Mating occurs in the spring. The young are born in late spring or summer, after a short gestation of 36 days. Littersize is two to three. Females have one litter per year, but may breed again if the first litter is lost early. The young are born blind and hairless; color patterns appear after one week.

It is generally not found on higher mountain ranges, but has been recorded up to 2100 m . In Europe, the Marbled Polecat inhabits steppes with sparse hawthorn bush and sloe trees, and oldfields. In western Yugoslavia , they occur in montane-steppe and woodland-steppe areas. In eastern Yugoslavia , Marbled Polecats are found from river terraces and low hills to mountainous meadows. In western Serbia , they inhabit the outskirts of settlements. On the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt , one adult male was captured in a sparsely vegetated sandy area. In Lebanon , Marbled Polecats are restricted to cultivated areas in close association with humans. In Israel , they live in the steppes and hills. In Central Asia, the Marbled Polecat is found in oases, tugai (river-valley complexes of forest, scrub, and meadow), dunes with sparse bush vegetation, clay steppes, and salt marshes;it is also found in irrigated country, melon patches, and vegetable fields, and sometimes enters buildings to forage. In Kazakhstan , Marbled Polecats are found in shifting dune country containing saxaul (Haloxylon), winter fat (Ewrotia ceratoides), and pea tree, and in salt marshes overgrown in saxaul. Marbled Polecats are also found in wormwood deserts, semi-deserts, and occasionally fescue and needle-grass steppes of the foothills. In north-western China and the Ordos Desert, the Marbled Polecat occurs in forested areas, and in Siberia, it inhabits the western foothills of the Altai and the Cuya steppe.","The diet includes small mammals (ground squirrels Spermophilus sp., Gray Dwarf Hamsters Cricetulus migratorius, Libyan Jirds Meriones libycus , mice, voles, and rabbits), birds, reptiles, amphibians, snails, insects, and fruits. In Quetta and Kandahar, rodents, small birds,lizards, snails, and beetles are eaten. In Israel , Marbled Polecats show a high seasonal variability in the diet. During summer, mole crickets (Gryllotalpa gryllotalpa) make up 66% of the diet, whereas in winter, 62% of the diet is rodents, such as voles (Microtus guentheri), House Mice (Mus musculus), Lesser Blind Mole Rats (Spalax leococon ehrenbergi), and Meriones sp. Marbled Polecats may take small poultry. Excess food may be cached for later use. The eyesight of Marbled Polecats is quite weak and they rely principally on a well-developed sense of smell. They have two kinds of killing bites: the first is the penetration of the prey’s body by the canines, and the second is crushing the prey without canine penetration. To kill small vertebrate prey, Marbled Polecats crush the thorax. If the prey struggles, they may pin the prey down with the forepaws and deliver headshakes or follow up by a bite to head or neck. On large prey, such as Guinea Pigs (Cavia porcellus), a Marbled Polecat bites the nape of the neck and eventually severs the spinal column at the base of the skull. With rats, it bites the throat. Fleeing prey are bitten dorsally, but defending prey are bitten on the head or neck.","Mating occurs from March to early June. Pregnant females have been observed in January, February, and May. In Israel , it is estimated that births occur from early February to early March. In Kazakhstan and Central Asia, Marbled Polecats give birth in February or March. Delayed implantation ofthe fertilized eggs into the uterus occurs and the total gestation length is from 243 to 327 days. Littersize is fourto eight. Only the mother cares for the young, which are reared in a nest of grass and leaves within a burrow. The eyes do not open until 40 days, but the young begin eating solid food at 30 days. Weaning occurs at 50-54 days and dispersal occurs at 61-68 days. Females attain adult size and sexual maturity at three months; males reach adult size at five months and sexual maturity at one year.","Mainly nocturnal and crepuscular, but sometimes active during the day. Den/rest sites are in burrows of large ground squirrels or other rodents, or they dig their own dens. Marbled Polecats in Central Asia live in tunnel systems dug by the Great Gerbil (Rhombomys opinus). In Baluchistan , they live in burrows dug by the rodents or they may use underground irrigation tunnels. Sleeping chambers are 60-100 cm from the den entrance. In winter, they line the den with grass. When a Marbled Polecat digs, it presses its chin and hindpaws firmly to the ground and removes earth with its forelegs. Obstacles such as roots are pulled out with the teeth.",,Classified as Vulnerable in The IUCN Red List. The subspecies Vp. peregusna is classified as Vulnerable. The major threat to this speciesis the loss of natural steppe and desert habitats. Steppe habitats are declining in Europe as they are converted to farmland. Secondary poisoning by rodenticides and population declines in key prey species may also be threats.

Out of twelve stomachs obtained in KwaZulu-Natal , six contained small mammals (Mastomys natalensis, Rhabdomys pumailio, and Mus minutoides). African Striped Weasels hunt by scent, with vision being used only in the last 50 cm . Their shape enables them to hunt inside the burrows of rodents. When prey is sighted, the weasel stops and then lunges at the prey; short chases may occur. In captivity, all prey were killed within seven minutes. Prey are seized by the back of the neck. African Striped Weasels do not shake the prey when attempting to kill; instead, they roll around and vigorously kick at the back of their victim, possibly dislocating the neck and immobilizing the prey. Although most killing bites are directed at the back of the head and the neck, females may use throat bites when killing large prey. In captivity, African Striped Weasels were unsuccessful in killing rats (Rattus) that were more than 108% the mass of the weasel.

They inhabit the murky waters of southern alluvial valleys as well as the crystal-clear waters of rocky mountain streams. In many areas, they occur in close association with American Beavers; Beaver ponds provide prey and dens/rest sites.","The diet is mainly fish, but also includes amphibians, crustaceans (especially crayfish), rodents, molluscs, reptiles, birds, and fruits. In many areas, the abundance and availability offish is the primary determinant of North American River Otter abundance. Typically, fish are consumed in inverse proportion to their swimming abilities: slow-moving species are captured and eaten more often. In coastal areas, the fish eaten are those that are abundant, intermediate in size, and found close to shore. North American River Otters hunt by sight and by touch. They inspect logjams, pools of deeper water in shallow streams, areas below waterfalls, natural eddies, or any other areas likely to hold fish and other prey. Upon detection, prey are pursued until captured. In shallow or murky water, North American River Otters hunt and detect prey with their vibrissae or by feeling with their forefeet. They can remain underwater for up to four minutes, and can swim at speeds of 11 km /h. They may hunt in small family groups, herding fish to shore or to each other to facilitate capture.","North American River Otters are polygynous. Mating occurs from December in the south to April in the north. Implantation of the fertilized eggs into the uterus is delayed for eight months; embryonic development lasts 61-63 days. Births occur from February to April, usually in a bank den or an abandoned Beaver lodge.

The main fish species eaten are from the suborder Characoidei and are 10-60 cm in length. Other prey items are rare, but may include crabs, small mammals, amphibians, birds, and molluscs. There are records of Giant Otters eating large prey such as anacondas and other snakes, black caimans, and turtles. On the Jauaperi River in the central Brazilian Amazon, remains of fish were found in all spraints. The main fish groups were Perciformes ( Cichlidae , 97-3%), Characiformes (86-5%) and Siluriformes (5-4%). The Characiformes were represented mainly by Erythrinidae ( Hoplias sp. 90-6%), followed by Serrasalmidae (28%). The Anostomidae occurred with a frequency of 18:7%. On the Aquidauana River , the Characiformes were the most frequent fish group, represented in 100% of all samples, followed by Siluriformes (66-6%) and Perciformes (33:3%). Prey is caught with the mouth and held in the forepaws while being consumed. Small fish may be eaten in the water, but larger prey are taken to shore.","The young are apparently born at the start of the dry season, from August to early October, although births may also occur from December to April. Gestation is 65-70 days, although evidence of delayed implantation of the fertilized eggs into the uterus has been observed in captivity. Litter size is up to five, usually one to three. Neonates weigh c. 200 g and measure c. 33 cm . They are able to eat solid food by three to four months and weaning occurs after nine months. The young remain with the parents until the birth of the next litter and probably for some time afterward. Adult size is reached after ten months and sexual maturity is attained at about two years.","Diurnal. Giant Otters frequently go ashore to groom, play or defecate. Rest sites are in burrows, under root systems, or under fallen trees. At certain points along a stream, areas of about 50 m * are cleared and used for resting and grooming. Dens may consist of one or more short tunnels that lead to a chamber about 1-2- 1-8 m wide. Nine vocalizations have been distinguished including screams of excitement and coos, given upon close intra-specific contact.",,"CITES Appendix I. Classified as Endangered in The IUCN Red List. The Giant Otter is protected throughoutits distribution.The current total wild population is estimated at between 1000 and 5000 individuals. Major threats are habitat degradation, water pollution, and the ever-increasing encroachment of humans on their habitats, which may lead to a potential future reduction in population size of around 50% over the next 20 years. Other threats for this species are the continued illegal killing for their skins or meat, captures for the zoo trade, or robbing of dens for cubs to be sold as pets. There are also conflicts with fishermen as otters are perceived to reduce available fish stock, although studies have shown little overlap in otter prey species and those of commercial interest. Canine diseases that are transferred through domestic livestock, such as parvovirus and distemper, are also a threat.",Autuori & Deutsch (1977) | Brecht-Munn & Munn (1988) | Carter & Rosas (1997) | Chebez (2008) | Corredor & Tigreros (2006) | Defler (1986b) | Duplaix (1980) | IUCN (2008) | Laidler & Laidler (1983) | Parera (1992) | Rosas et al.

They prefer waterways with clear water, abundant waterside vegetation, and high availability of potential den sites; they are rare or absent from sluggish, murky, lowland waters. In Northern Mexico , along a 30 km stretch ofriver, the habitat preferred by a Neotropical Otter included pools that averaged more than 0-8 m deep, more than 14- 6 m wide, with over 64% understory vegetation cover, and rock talus/vegetation cover within 4-8 m of the water's edge.","The diet is mainly fish, but also includes crustaceans, molluscs, small mammals, birds, reptiles, and insects. In southern Brazil , spraint analysis revealed a diet comprising mainly fish (including Loricariidae, Callichthyidae, Cichlidae , Pimelodidae, Auchenipteridae, and Erythrinidae ), and also mammals and insects. In the coastal plain of Santa Catarina State , southern Brazil , spraints contained fish (mainly Hoplias malabaricus and Geophagus brasiliensis ) and crustaceans (mainly the river crab Trichodactylus fluviatilis). The presence of fruits, reptiles, birds, and mammals in the diet was occasional and opportunistic. On Ibera Lake, Argentina , 205 spraints contained mainly fish ( Cichlidae , Characidae, Synbranchidae, Loricariidae, and Erythrinidae ), but also crustaceans and molluscs. Seasonal variation was observed in the diet: in the summer, crustaceans and vertebrates (other than fish) increased. A higher percentage of benthic fish species was also observed in the summer, while pelagic and benthopelagic species increased in the winter. Such dietary changes may have resulted from the different habitat used in different seasons, from the lake coast in winter towards a more internal marshy area in summer. Foraging dives last 20-30 seconds. Small prey are eaten while in an upright position at the water’s surface; large prey are taken ashore.","Mating occurs mostly in spring, but may occur throughout the year in certain localities. Gestation lasts 56-86 days. Litter size may be up to five, but is typically two or three. Births occur in nests of grass and leaves located on the banks of streams, in hollow logs or trees, among root systems, or in cavities excavated by the female. The young are born blind but fully furred. Their eyes open after 44 days, and they start to venture outside the natal den when c. 52 days old. Aquatic activity starts at c. 74 days. Before they are old enough to follow the female, the young spend most of the day playing near the natal den. Females raise the young alone as males do not provide parental care.","Mainly diurnal, with activity peaks in the middle or late afternoon. May become nocturnal in areas of high human activity. Rest sites are in natural cavities along riverbanks, in excavated burrows, or in dense grass. In Brazil , two large caves were also used as shelters and to raise young. Neotropical Otters mainly use rest sites located high on riverbanks, probably because they are less vulnerable to flooding. Sprainting sites are usually on solid, high and dry areas, in close proximity to deep water; these sites include logs, root systems, rocks, sand bars, and planks under bridges.",,"CITES Appendix I. Classified as Data Deficient in The IUCN Red List. Because the Neotropical Otter is secretive and lives in remote areas, the status of populations is unknown in many regions. The major threat for this species is hunting for its pelt. Another threat is water pollution caused by mining and ranching. Neoptropical Otters are sometimes kept in captivity and trained to catch fish.

They spend most of their time within 150 m of shore, but occasionally may venture into freshwater tributaries flowing into the sea.","The diet is primarily crustaceans, molluscs, and fish, but also includes birds, small mammals, and fruit. Along the Chilean coast, the diet consists of crabs (69-8%), fish (19:9%), shrimp (6:4%), and molluscs (3-9%). On the Valdivian coast in the south of Chile , spraints contained 25 species: 52% crustaceans, 40% fish, and 8% molluscs. Marine Otters showed opportunistic feeding behavior, selecting prey seasonally according to their availability. Marine Otters fish by first swimming to a hunting area, where they then dive underwater for 6-64 seconds. Captured prey are consumed in the waterif they are small enough to be handled easily, or taken ashore if larger. Crabs are almost always taken ashore. Prey can be carried in the mouth, or carried on the belly while swimming dorsally. Unlike Sea Otters, Marine Otters do not use rocks as anvils to crack open bivalves or shellfish. At Isla Choros, northern Chile , Marine Otters spent more time foraging in a wave-protected site compared with a wave-exposed habitat. Successful dives reached 26-9% in the wave-exposed habitat and 38-2% in the wave-protected habitat. Foraging dives were 18% shorter in wave-exposed as compared with wave-protected habitat.","Mating occurs in December orJanuary.

Although marine mammals, they rarely venture more than one km from shore. Typically, they live and forage in waters at depths of up to 100 m , but the highest densities of Sea Otters occur in waters less than 40 m deep.","The diet is mostly marine invertebrates such as abalones, sea urchins, crabs, and molluscs. Other prey include squid, octopus, chitons, tubeworms, scallops, and, very occasionally, fish. In the northern Kodiak Archipelago, clams were the most frequently identified prey (57-67%, mostly Saxidomus giganteus); mussels (Mytilus sp.), crabs (primarily Telmessus sp.), and green sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis) contributed 25% to the diet. On the north side of the Alaska Peninsula, the dominant prey species in 50 spraints were mussels (Mytilus edulis), followed by three species of clams (Siliqua sp., Spisula polynyma, and Tellina lutea), sand dollars (Echinarachnius parma), and helmet crabs (Telmessus cheiragonus). In south-east Alaska , butter clams (S. giganteus) are the major prey items. Sea Otters on the outer coast of Washington feed heavily on bivalves (63%) and have a diverse diet consisting of several prey groups. In contrast, Sea Otters in the Strait ofJuan de Fuca have a restricted diet dominated by more than 60% red urchins (Strongylocentrotus franciscanus), with only two other prey species comprising more than 10% of their diet. Sea Otters forage in both rocky and soft-sediment areas on or near the ocean floor. They have good underwater vision and most prey is captured by sight. Prey hiding under rocks or in crevices may also be captured by feeling with the forefeet. Underwater dives are sustained by lungs that are 2-3 times larger than those of similarsized terrestrial mammals. Most hunting dives last 50-90 seconds. In coastal Washington , the average dive time was 55 seconds and average surface time was 45 seconds, irrespective of dive success. At least 77% of all dives were successful in capturing prey. Prey capture success was significantly lower for subadults (63%) than adults (82%). Sea Otters break the exoskeleton of large or hard-shelled prey by hitting the prey item on a rock carried by the otter on its belly. Sea Otters face a tremendous thermoregulatory challenge because of their constant life at sea. When in water, buoyancy and insulation are provided by their fur and the air bubbles trapped within it. The integrity of their pelage is thus essential to thermoregulation. Their metabolic heat production is 2-3 times greater than that of similar-sized terrestrial mammals. To sustain such heat production requires that Sea Otters consume 20-33% of their body mass in food daily. Sea Otters can drink seawater, and their kidneys produce very concentrated urine to avoid unnecessary water loss.","Sea Otters are polygynous: males may mate with more than one female during the season. Mating and births occur throughout the year, but parturition peaks are in May and June in the Aleutians and from January to March off the coast of California . Implantation of the fertilized eggs into the uterus is delayed, and total gestation lasts from 4-12 months. Births occur in water. Litter size is one, very rarely two. At birth, neonates weigh 1.4-2.3 kg . The female swims on her back and nurses with the young on her chest. Young Sea Otters may take some solid food shortly after birth, but may nurse until they are almost adult size. The period of dependency on the mother is thought to be about five to eight months. Offspring start diving after two months. Sexual maturity is reached at four years of age. Most females do not have young every year, although some females are capable of annual reproduction. Males may begin mating at five orsix years, but usually do not become active breeders until several more years have passed.","Generally diurnal, with peaks in activity at dawn and dusk. Daytime foraging increases when females care for young. In Prince William Sound, Alaska , more time was spent foraging (30%) than on any other activity, and foraging bouts were longer than all other activities. Sea Otters rest by floating belly-up in the water with their feet out of the water. They sometimes rest on rocks near the water and often spend the night in a kelp bed, lying under strands of kelp to avoid drifting while sleeping. Ten vocalizations have been described for Sea Otters including screams of distress (heard especially when mothers and young are separated) and coos (heard mostly when individuals are content or in familiar company).",,"CITES Appendix I and II.

They are legally harvested in Alaska , with the annual harvest slightly exceeding 1000 animals. Sea Otters are also persecuted as perceived competitors for shellfish.

In the southern marine habitats of Chile , Southern River Otters feed mainly on fish. In Argentina , crustaceans largely dominate the diet (99%) and fish occur rarely (less than 2%). Differences in the proportion offish and crustaceans in the diet may reflect the differential availability of prey types in different habitats: fish productivity is low in freshwater lakes compared to the oceans, which may explain the high proportion of crustaceans in freshwater lakes.","In central Chile , mating occurs in July and August, and young are born in September or October.

They avoid areas of deep water.","The diet is mainly fish, frogs, and aquatic invertebrates (including crustaceans and crabs). Birds and small mammals (such as rodents and lagomorphs) may be consumed on occasion. In general, the mean proportion offish declines from 94% on seashores, to 71% on lakes and fish ponds, to 64% on rivers and streams. On inland waters, the abundance of crayfish is an essential food item. In Northern Ireland , over 50% of spraints were composed of sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus), salmonids and cyprinids, with Sticklebacks constituting the most frequently occurring prey category. The frequency of occurrence of eels ( Anguilla anguilla) was found to be consistently higher in spraints collected from smaller streams. In eastern Poland ,fish constitutes 51% of the food biomass consumed in spring-summer and 40% in autumnwinter, with perch (Perca fluviatilis), pike (Esox lucius), and roach (Rutilus rutilus) being captured most frequently. Amphibians (mainly Rana temporaria) make up 34% of the food biomass in spring-summer and 58% in autumn-winter. The cold season diet depends on river size. On small rivers with forested valleys, Eurasian Otters feed nearly exclusively on amphibians (72-90% of food biomass). As the size of the river increases, and riverside habitat becomes more open (sedge and reed marshes instead of forests), Eurasian Otters shift to catching predominantly fish (up to 76%). In southern Poland , the main component of the diet is fish (47-9%, including brown trout Salmo trutta and rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss). Other important food items are 21-4% frogs ( R . temporaria) and 30% birds, small mammals, aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates, and plant debris. In southern Italy , spraint analysis revealed that fish represented the dominant food (57-3% mean volume), followed by amphibians (18:9%) and crayfish (15-6%). Seasonal variations in fish consumption were related to changes in fish activity and to environmental conditions; the importance of fish decreased in winter, when flooding increased water speeds and turbidity, and thus reduced the hunting efficiency of the otters. Hibernating amphibians represented a primary alternative resource. Insects and reptiles were eaten more frequently in summer, while birds predominated during their breeding season. In Hungary , the primary food is fish (89-8% for riverine and 87-5% for backwater habitats); Eurasian Otters living in riverine habitats, compared to backwaters, consume more birds (3-9% and 0-7%, respectively), less mammals (0-5% and 0-9%, respectively), less reptiles and amphibians (5-6% and 10-2%, respectively) and less invertebrates (0-1% and 0-6%, respectively); most fish eaten are small-sized (below 100 g ), and the most frequently taken species is Carassius sp. In Iran , the major food items are 38-1% chub (Alburnoides bipunctatus) and 34-8% carp (Cyprinus carpio). Prey are captured with the mouth, but the forepaws are used to handle the prey for consumption.","Females are polyestrous, with the cycle lasting four to six weeks; estrus lasts about two weeks. Mating typically occurs in late winter or early spring. The gestation period is 60-63 days and births peak in April or May. The main entrance of bank burrows may open underwater and then slope upward into the bank to a nest chamber that is above the high-water level. Litter size is one to five, usually two to three. The young are born blind and weigh about 130 g at birth. They open their eyes after one month and emerge from the den and begin to swim at two months.

In Eastern Cape Province , South Africa , the diet is mostly fish (47%), crabs (38%), and frogs (8%). In KwaZulu-Natal , the frequency of occurrence of food items in 516 spraints was 64% fish, 43% crabs, 43% amphibians, and 18% insects. In contrast, 228 spraints collected near a troutriver contained 39% crabs, 38% fish, 20% frogs, 2% insects (mostly dragonfly larvae, Odonata), and unidentified birds. In a non-trout area, 66 spraints contained 30% crabs, 27% frogs, 25% fish, 10% birds (mostly Anatidae and little grebe Tachybaptus ruficollis), and 5% insects. In three stomachs from the Cape Province , South Africa , one contained crabs, one contained frogs and fish, and one contained frogs,fish, a beetle (Coleoptera), and a caterpillar. Spotted-necked Otters generally fish alone and almost all fishing is done within 10 m from the shore. When fishing in groups, cooperation among individuals may help facilitate prey capture by herding fish toward each other. Fishing in groups probably occurs when females are training their young. Fish are captured during short dives of less than 20 seconds. Once underwater, a Spotted-necked Otter scans for prey, turning its head from side to side. Prey are detected visually and pursued until captured. Crabs, fish, and frogs are captured with the mouth; the forefeet are not used in prey capture. Fish smaller than 10 cm are consumed in the water, but larger fish are taken to shore for consumption. Fishing forays typically last 10-20 minutes, but may last up to 3 h.","In Tanzania , mating occurs in July and the young are born in September, after a gestation of c. 60 days. In Zambia , three two-week-old cubs from one litter were captured in December. Delayed implantation probably does not occur. Litter size is one to three. Neonates are blind and helpless. The young remain with the mother for up to one year. Males do not provide parental care.","Mostly diurnal, with activity peaks during early morning and late afternoon. In KwaZulu-Natal , Spotted-necked Otters were most active from 06:00-09:00 h and 15:00-21:00 h. Nocturnal activity usually only occurs during periods of full moon. Rest sites are in rock cavities, bank dens, holes in root systems, or dense vegetation. Spotted-necked Otters can dig their own burrows. In KwaZulu-Natal , resting sites were among trees and shrub roots (29%), reeds (21%), small islands near dams (23%), tall grass (14%), swamps (11%), and sheltered places among rocks (2%). A 4-2-km section of river contained ten resting sites, with a mean distance of 467 m between dens.",,"CITES Appendix II. Classified as Least Concern in The IUCN Red List. Although this is a widespread species, there are local population declines occurring. Spotted-necked Otters are sensitive to habitat alterations and pollution, and because they consume fish, they are susceptible to bioaccumulation of pesticides and other toxic chemical compounds. Throughout Africa, otters are killed for their skins and meat or because they are regarded as competitors for food, particularly in rural areas where fishing is an important source of income. During the last few years, their habitats have been drastically changed or lost following bush clearance, deforestation, overgrazing, siltation, draining of wetlands, water extraction, or denudation ofriparian vegetation.",Angelici et al.

They occur mostly in fresh water; some populations inhabit saltwater coasts, but because they require fresh water to drink, even coastal populations occur near freshwater tributaries. They also occupy many natural or man-made lakes and reservoirs, but prefer areas of shallow water. In South Africa , African Clawless Otters prefer riverine habitats covered with dense vegetation, while areas of short grass are avoided. They also select areas with boulders and/or reed beds, which provide high crab density and shelter. In southern Nigeria , African Clawless Otters are mainly restricted to brackish streams (with mangrove vegetation along the banks) and, more occasionally, transitional habitats between freshwater and brackish-water environments.","African Clawless Otters are primarily crab eaters, but other foods such as frogs, fish, and insects are consumed. Fish increases in importance in the diet during winter, when they are lethargic and easier to capture. Lobsters, octopus, and shellfish are eaten along the seacoast. In two reserves in the Eastern Cape Province , South Africa , the diet was more varied at Mkambati (15 prey species) than Dwessa (seven species). In terms of relative percentage frequency of occurrence, the spiny lobster (Panulirus homarus) was found to be the most common prey item at both Mkambati (37-9%) and at Dwessa (35-2%), followed by fish (31% and 36-6%, respectively), crabs (22:4% and 19-7%) and molluscs (3-1% and 4-2%). Lobster and fish are relatively abundant within these reserves, suggesting prey availability rather than selective feeding influenced diet. At another site in the Eastern Cape Province , the three most common prey categories found in otter spraints were the crab Potamonaules perlatus (51%), insects (19%), and the fish Tilapia sparrmanii (18%). At Betty’s Bay, South Africa , fish are the most important prey category (59% of the biomass), followed by octopus (15%), red rock crab Plagusia chabrus (13%), cape lobsterJasus lalandii (10%), and the brown rock crab Cyclograpsus punctatus (0-8%). In eastern Zimbabwe , the diet is mainly the river crab Potamon perlatus (42%). African Clawless Otters use various hunting methods. In shallow or murky water, they detect crabs with their forefeet as they feel around underwater rock crevices. Prey is grabbed with the forefeet and then bitten and eaten. In shallow but clear water, African Clawless Otters may immerse their heads and scan for prey visually while feeling under rocks with the forefeet. In deeper water, they dive straight down and can remain underwater for up to 50 seconds. African Clawless Otters eat small prey while they swim upright at the surface, whereas larger prey are taken to shore for consumption. In South Africa , African Clawless Otters were observed to select open water within 8 m of the shore. Foraging involved moving into shallow water (c. 0-2 m deep) and walking along the substrate feeling for prey with the forefeet. African Clawless Otters prefer hunting at depths of 0-5- 1- 5 m.","Mating may occur anytime during the year, but most births occur during the start of the rainy season. Births have been recorded in July and August in Zambia , and young have been found in March and April in Uganda . There appears to be no set breeding season in West Africa. Most births in a coastal area of South Africa occurred in December and January. Gestation lasts 63 days. The litter size is one to three. The young are born blind, but with some fur. Their eyes open after 16-30 days, and weaning occurs after 60 days. Sexual maturity is reached during the first year.","Mainly nocturnal, but may be active during the day in areas remote from human disturbance. Rest sites are in burrows (holts), under large rocks or root systems, or in dense vegetation near water; they may dig their own burrows. In South Africa , the occurrence of spraints, couches and resting places is closely tied to freshwater sources; holts are located adjacent to river banks, oxbow lakes, or dam shores, and spraint sites are found in dense, tall grass cover beside water less than 1 m deep. In the Tsitsikama Coastal National Park, South Africa , the activity at several holts indicated about 32% utilization, with an estimated one otter to every three holts.",,"CITES Appendix I and II. Classified as Least Concern in The IUCN Red List; the Congo Clawless Otter (congicus) is also listed as Least Concern. Habitat alteration and water pollution are the main threats to this species, asit affects the abundance of crabs and other prey.

In a subarctic area in Finland , adult females were found to live in areas where the abundance of their preferred Microtus prey was the highest; dominant males lived in less productive habitats than females, but in more productive areas than non-dominant mature males.","The diet consists mainly of small mammals, such as voles, mice, rats, lemmings, squirrels, and lagomorphs, but also includes birds, eggs, lizards, frogs, snakes, insects, earthworms, and fruit. In Great Britain , the percentage frequency of occurrence in the diet consists of 65% lagomorphs, 16% small rodents, and 17% birds and birds’ eggs; males eat a greater proportion of lagomorphs than females, which eat more small rodents. In Denmark (where European Rabbits are absent), a dietary study showed that rodents are the most important prey group, constituting 84% of their diet (frequency of occurrence). Ermines ate birds and birds’ eggs more often than sympatric Least Weasels, while Least Weasels ate more insectivores. Ermines ate more Microtus voles and Water Voles than Least Weasels, while Least Weasels ate more Bank Voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) and Moles (Talpa europaea). In the Italian Alps, 60% of scats contained small rodents, indicating that they were the main prey. However, the frequency of occurrence offruits in the diet increased significantly in August, after rodent biomass had dropped by more than 50% in July.

Ermines generally hunt in a zig-zag pattern, progressing by a series of leaps that are up to 50 cm long. Prey are located mostly by smell or sound, and are often pursued into underground burrows or under snow. Ermines usually kill prey by biting the base of the skull. They sometimes attack animals considerably larger than themselves, such as adult hares. Ermines may cache excess food underground for later use during the winter.","Females are polyestrous, but produce only one litter per year; the estrous cycle is four weeks. Mating occurs in late spring or early summer, but implantation of the fertilized eggs into the uterus is delayed for 9-10 months. Embryonic development is just over one month. Births occur in April or May in the Northern Hemisphere and around October in New Zealand . Litter size may reach 18, but typically is four to eight. Neonates are born blind, naked, and weigh 2-7-4- 2 g . Their eyes open after four to six weeks. Solid food is taken after four or five weeks, though lactation may continue until weeks seven to twelve. They grow rapidly and by eight weeks are able to hunt with their mother. At two to three months, their permanent detention is complete. Females reach adult size at six months. They attain sexual maturity at two to three months and sometimes mate during their first summer. Males attain full size and sexual maturity after one year.","Primarily nocturnal, but can be active at any time during the day. Their long shape makes them sensitive to cold temperatures and this, combined with a high metabolic rate, requires that Ermines hunt constantly to fulfill their energetic demands. Short periods of activity and rest alternate every three to five hours. Dens/ rest sites are in crevices, among tree roots, in hollow logs, or in burrows taken over from a rodent. Several nests are maintained within an individual’s home range; these are lined with dry vegetation or the fur and feathers of its prey.

Because of their larger size, males generally consume larger prey than females. In North America, Long-tailed Weasels feed upon a wide variety of small vertebrates, but concentrate on rodents and rabbits of small to medium size. The diet of tropical Long-tailed Weasels, although not well known,is thought to consist mainly of small mammals, rabbits, and birds and their eggs. Small-sized prey, such as mice and voles, usually are subdued when the weasel throws its body into a tight coil around the prey; these are then killed by a bite to the nape of the neck. Long-tailed Weasels can kill animals larger than themselves, such as rabbits. Large prey is initially grabbed by the most convenient part of the animal before a killing bite is administered. Underground mediumsized prey is subdued by a ventral attack and killed by grasping the throat, which results in suffocation.","Females are monoestrous. Mating occurs in July and August. Implantation of the fertilized eggs into the uterusis delayed until the following March; embryonic development is approximately 27 days. Births occur in April or May. Litter size is up to nine, but is usually around six. The young are born blind and weigh about 3 g at birth. They open their eyes after 35-37 days and are weaned at around 3% weeks.

They tolerate habitats with a rainfall of over 2000 mm (annually) as well as arid areas with less than 100 mm annual rainfall. Honey Badgers are found from sea level up to 4050 m .","The diet is mostly mammals, insects, amphibians, reptiles and birds, but also includes roots, berries, and fruit (such as ber Zizyphusjubata). Favorite foods are honey and the larvae of honeybees (Hymenoptera). However, their adaptation to burrowing, together with the abundance of subterranean animals found in six stomachs, suggests that honey is only a secondary food item. Consumption of honey may also be seasonal because it is more widely available in the drier months of the year. In October and November, Honey Badgers in the Kalahari Gemsbok National Park, South Africa , were found to eat mainly rodents, which occurred in 60% of scats and made up c. 30% of the volume of food. Ostrich (Struthio camelus) chicks, Spring Hares (Pedetes capensis ), Meerkats, as well as domestic sheep and goats, were also eaten. They are strong diggers, and do not hesitate to dig after rodents or other prey hiding underground. Food items are detected mostly by smell or sound. Excess food may be cached in a den. When Honey Badgers eat, the food is held between the front claws while the forelegs rest on the ground. Beehives are opened by tearing away the wood of trees; honey combs are also scooped out from the cracks of rocks with the claws of the forefeet. Grubs are removed from the comb with their incisors. The clay capsules of estivating lungfish (Protopterus aethiopicus), cases of insect pupae, carapaces of turtles, or skins of animals are peeled away to expose the softer inner parts to be eaten. Honey Badgers dig large spiders out of holes 15-25 cm deep in the ground. Fish are caught with the claws at the edge of streams or from drying pans. They may raid campgrounds or dumpsters at night and are widely blamed for breaking into poultry houses and apiaries. The anecdotal relationship between the Honey Badger and a bird, the greater honeyguide (Indicator indicator), may be mythical. Although these two animals may occur together at the nests of bees, a complete observation of this supposed symbiotic relationship, from the initial attraction by a greater honeyguide of a Honey Badger, through guiding to a nest by the honeyguide, to the breaking open of the nest by the Honey Badger does not exist.","Mating occurs throughout the year and there appears to be no distinct breeding season. The gestation period is 50-70 days. Litter size is commonly one to two. Only the motherraises the young. The young are born blind and helpless inside a burrow. At two days of age, one captive Honey Badger weighed c. 0-23 kg and was hairless except for a few hairs on the face; the head and body length was 19- 7 cm , and the tail was 3-8 cm . It uttered squeaks and low guttural sounds during the first weeks, usually at feeding time; vocalization changed to deep, drawn-out, ominous growls at ten weeks. Within three months, the young have a fully developed adult pelage. The claws are fully formed on each foot at four weeks of age. The eyes open after 33 days and teeth begin erupting at 36 days and are fully developed at around three months. Adult size is reached after six months. Attempts at walking progress from a swimming motion (using all four legs) at age two to three weeks,to a forward dragging movement by the front legs at age five weeks, to a trot, similar to that of an adult, at eight weeks. Climbing starts at ten weeks. The young reach independence after 12-16 months.","Primarily nocturnal, although diurnal observations are numerous. Honey Badgers shelter in burrows, thick brush, caves, clumps of fallen bamboo, hollow trees, old ruins, rock shelters, dens excavated by themselves, or abandoned burrows. Hollow trees are entered from the top.",,Classified as Least Concern in The IUCN Red List. Honey Badgers do not occur at high densities and are considered uncommon throughout their range.

In British Columbia , they prefer open range and agricultural habitats that have fine sandy-loam and well-drained soils.","The diet includes small mammals (especially marmots, ground squirrels, prairie dogs, pocket gophers, cottontail rabbits, mice, voles, chipmunks, and squirrels), birds, eggs, reptiles, amphibians, and invertebrates (insects and molluscs). Carrion is also eaten. In British Columbia , the six main prey species are the Columbian Ground Squirrel (Spermophilus columbianus), Yellow-bellied Marmot (Marmota Slaviventris), Northern Pocket Gopher (Thomomys talpoides), Muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus), Southern Red-backed Vole (Myodes gapperi), and Meadow Vole (Microtus pennsylvanicus). In south-eastern Wyoming , prairie dogs were found in 57% of stomach and fecal samples from female American Badgers. The most common food item in the diet in west-central Minnesota and south-eastern North Dakota is small mammals (98%, primarily Muridae and Geomyidae). Other prey includes insects (40%), and birds and eggs (32%, mostly ducks Anatidae ). Reptiles, amphibians and molluscs are also eaten, but are less common than other foods. Insects and birds’ eggs are more common in the diet during spring (April-May) than summer (June-July). Birds are more frequent in the diets of adults than juveniles. In South Dakota , 40% of stomach contents were mammals, 35% were of plant origin, 10% were birds, 10% were insects, and the remainder was mostly inorganic materials. American Badgers obtain most of their food by excavating the burrows of fossorial animals. If large prey is taken, such as a rabbit, the badger may dig a hole, carry in the prey, and remain below ground with it for several days. There are reports of American Badgers forming a “hunting partnership” with Coyotes. The Coyote apparently usesits keen sense of smell to locate burrowing rodents and the American Badger digs them up with its powerful claws. Both predators then share the proceeds. The techniques used by American Badgers when hunting Richardson’s Ground Squirrels (Spermophilus richardsonii) have been observed. They frequently hunted hibernating squirrels in the autumn, sometimes hunted infants in the spring, but rarely hunted active squirrels in the summer. They always captured hibernating and active squirrels underground, but sometimes intercepted fleeing squirrels aboveground. The most common hunting technique used was excavation of the burrow, but plugging of openings accounted for 5-23% of hunting actions. Plugging occurred predominantly in mid-June to late July, before most ground squirrels hibernated, and in late August to late October when juvenile males were active, but other squirrels were in hibernation. American Badgers usually used soil from around the tunnel opening or soil dragged 30-270 cm from a nearby mound to plug tunnels. Theykill ground squirrels with a single grasping bite directed dorsally or laterally to the thorax. The canines and third upper incisors generally only bruise the skin, without puncturing it, but cause extensive hemorrhaging in the thoracic cavity. Food items are sometimes buried and eaten later.","Mating occurs in late July or August. Implantation ofthe fertilized eggs into the uterus is delayed until December—February, and births take place in late March or early April. The total gestation period is about seven months; actual embryonic development is about six weeks. Litter size is one to five, usually two. The young are born underground in a nest of dry grass. They are weaned at aboutsix weeks and disperse soon after. Some young females may mate in the first breeding season following birth, when they are about four months old; males wait until the following year.","Mainly nocturnal, but can be active at any hour. American Badgers rest underground in burrows; these are either self-excavated or are modified burrows that were initially made by another animal. The burrow can be as long as 10 m and can extend 3 m below the surface. A bulky nest of grass is located in an enlarged chamber; the entrances are marked by mounds of earth.

They prefer densely forested areas adjacent to open fields, up to 1700 m . Occasionally, they are found in suburban areas. In central Spain , European Badgers prefer mid-elevation mountain areas, where both dehesas (open woods with pastures) and pine forests prevail; lower elevation areas are avoided. They are associated with watercourses and prefer trees and rock covered areas. In the Swiss Jura Mountains, European Badgers use forests and wooded pastures in the winter and spring and grain fields in the summer and autumn.","The diet includes earthworms (Lumbricus terrestris) and other invertebrates (such as insects and molluscs), small mammals (mice, rabbits, rats, voles, shrews, moles, hedgehogs), birds, reptiles, amphibians, carrion, nuts, acorns, berries, fruits, tubers, and mushrooms. In forests, European Badgers rely predominantly on earthworms (on average, 62% in diets). In farmlands and pastures, earthworms and plant material (usually garden fruit and cereals) play equally important roles (34% each). In England , the main foods are earthworms, insects, fruit, and wheat; grass is also ingested in substantial quantities. Earthworms are the most frequent food items, but wheat is almost as important in terms of percentage volume. In Poland , earthworms constitute 82-89% of the biomass consumed in spring. In summer and autumn, the proportion declines to 56% in pristine forest, and to 24% in a mosaic of forests, fields, and orchards. Supplementary food items during this time are amphibians (in forests) and garden fruits (in a rural landscape). In Denmark , earthworms, small mammals, cereals, and arthropods dominate the diet. In central Switzerland , the diet comprises 55% faunal material and 45% vegetal material. Earthworms have the highest frequency of occurrence. Voles, insects, and maize are eaten during most of the year, but never in large volumes, while wasps, cherries, plums, and oats are eaten seasonally and in large volumes. In Italy , earthworms and maize are the staple foods and together account for 57% of the mean estimated volume. Earthworm consumption varies seasonally, with a marked decrease in summer; this decline is compensated by a significant increase in fruits eaten. Maize is consumed all year round with no significant seasonal variation (from 21% in summer to 44-6% in winter). Prey items include amphibians (9%) and mammals (7-2%, primarily rodents and lagomorphs). In a dry Mediterranean coastal habitat in central Italy , European Badgers feed primarily on fruits and insects (90% ofthe total amount of food eaten each year). Other less important food items include myriapods, molluscs, birds, and mammals; earthworms do not play an important role in the diet in any period ofthe year.","Mating can occur year-round, but typically occurs in late winter to midsummer. Implantation of the fertilized eggs into the uterus can either be immediate or delayed for about ten months; the time of implantation seems to be controlled by light and temperature conditions. Embryonic developmentlasts six to eight weeks. The total gestation may thus be up to 9-12 months. Births occur mainly from February to March.Litter size is usually three or four, but can be as many as six. The young weigh 75 g at birth; their eyes open after one month. They nurse for 2:5 months and usually separate from the mother in the autumn. Both sexes reach sexual maturity after one year.","European Badgers show crepuscular or nocturnal activity, generally starting after sunset and ending before sunrise, and are active on average for about eight hours per day. The highestlevel of activity is between 20:00 h and 03:00 h. During the day, they mainly rest in elaborate, communal burrow systems (setts) with numerous entrances, passages, and chambers, but other types of rest sites may be used. Setts may cover an area of 0-25 ha; they are used year after year and increase in complexity over time, and may eventually cover several hectares. There are two types of burrows: “main” setts (with many entrances) and small “outliers” (with usually only one entrance). Nests may be located 10 m from an entrance, 2-3 m below the surface, and have a diameter of 1- 5 m. Within a burrow system, European Badgers may utilize one nest for several months and then move to another part of the burrow. The living quarters are kept quite clean. Bedding material (dry grass, bracken, moss, or leaves) is dragged backwards into the den. Around setts, there are several dung pits, sunning grounds, and play areas. Well-defined paths, up to 2-3 km , extend from the sett to foraging areas. In south-western Spain ,setts are located almost everywhere, but European Badgers prefer easily dug, well-drained soils, with good vegetation cover within foraging habitats. They select sites with high surrounding shrub density, large shrubs covering the burrow, and close to the centre of the territory. During bouts of cold weather or deep snow, European Badgers may sleep in the sett for days or weeks. In northern Europe, this winter sleep may last several months. During this period, there is a substantial drop in body temperature and the badger lives off fat reserves accumulated in the summer and autumn. In south-west Portugal , main setts are the most frequently used restsites (62:3%); however, an average of 14 other resting sites are used in each territory. Females use more than twice as many occasional resting sites as do males. Generally burrows (predominantly main setts) are most frequently used during winter and autumn, whilst non-burrow shelters are preferred during spring and summer, when the weather is hot, dry and not windy. In northern Italy , ten setts (mean number of entrances = 2-1) were detected in the study area. Each radio-collared badger used 2-3 setts, occupying one sett from one to eight months before moving to another one. All badgers shared (although in different periods) one main sett located in the inner part of their ranges.",,"Classified as Least Concern in The IUCN Red List. European Badgers are generally considered common and of no special conservation concern, although declines in numbers have occurred in some areas. They sometimes damage property or consume crops, and thus are often regarded as pests and persecuted. The hair is used to make various kinds of brushes, and badger skin has been used to make rugs. European Badgers are commonly killed on roads; as many as 50,000 may be killed each year in Great Britain . They are vectors of bovine tuberculosis, which has led to controversial efforts to reduce European Badger numbers in parts of Britain.",Balestrieri et al. (2004) | Elmeros et al.

They are inhabitants of remote northern areas where there are few humans. Wolverines make greater use of forested areas during winter, and greater use of tundra during summer. Altitudinal movements may also occur seasonally, with higher elevations being occupied during the summer and lower altitudes during the winter, probably because of snow accumulation and prey abundance. In central Idaho , USA , radiotracked Wolverines used higher elevations in summer versus winter, and they shifted use of cover types from whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) in summer to lower elevation Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziezii) and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) communities in winter. Wolverines also preferred northerly aspects, but avoided roads and ungulate winter range. In British Columbia , Canada , radio-telemetry revealed that Wolverines negatively responded to human disturbance within occupied habitat; males tended to avoid helicopter skiing areas. Habitat associations of females were more complex, but in the summer they avoided roads and recently logged areas. In the Columbia Mountains, where winter recreation is widespread, females prefer alpine and avalanche environments where Hoary Marmot (Marmota caligata) and Columbia Ground Squirrel prey are found in the summer. During the winter, females tend to avoid areas with helicopter and backcountry skiing, and prefer areas where Moose (Alces alces) can be found.","The diet includes the carcasses of large ungulates, such as Moose and Reindeer (Rangifer tarandus). In many areas, Wolverines are dependent on the ability of larger predators, especially Gray Wolves, to provide kills. In coastal areas, they also feed on the carcasses of whales and seals that wash ashore. Wolverines also prey opportunistically on deer, sheep, small mammals (rodents such as Marmota and Myodes, lagomorphs, and ground squirrels), birds, and eggs. Berries, nuts and fungus are occasionally eaten. Within two study areas in British Columbia , scat analysis revealed a diet that varied regionally and seasonally: Moose, Reindeer, and Hoary Marmots were abundant and common prey items within both study areas. Mountain Goats (Oreamnos americanus) and North American Porcupine (Erithizon dorsata) were more frequent prey items in the Columbia Mountains, while Snowshoe Hare (Lepus americanus) and American Beaver (Castor canadensis ) were more frequent prey items in the Omineca Mountains. Reindeer, Hoary Marmots, and North American Porcupines were found in significantly higher frequencies in the diet of reproductive females. Predation on ungulates (such as Reindeer)is facilitated when there is deep snow. Wolverines kill larger prey by a bite at the neck or throat. Small rodents may be chased, pounced upon, or dug out of the ground. Excess food is cached for later use and is covered with earth or snow, or sometimes wedged in the forks of trees. In Alberta and British Columbia , cache sites were in stands of black spruce (Picea mariana) or mixed-wood of high complexity, dominated by conifers, and in which the trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) and balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera) component consisted of mostly dead or dying trees. These sites offered relatively good visibility of the surrounding area; caches were never located in the very dense homogenous spruce stands. Cache sites were classified as “simple caches”, composed of a single feeding site and/or excavation, and “cache complexes”, involving one or more feeding “stations”, latrines, resting sites, and climbing trees that may have been used as avenues of escape from competitors or predators. The better used cache complexes were accessed by numerous well-used trails made by the Wolverines themselves. Caches contained the remains of Moose that were believed to have been killed by Wolves.","Wolverines exhibit a polygamous mating system, as some males produce offspring with more than one female in a single year. Females often reproduce with the same male in subsequent breeding years, but sometimes change their partner, possibly as a consequence of a change in the territory-holding male in the area. Females are monoestrous and apparently give birth about every two years. Mating occurs from May to August. Ovulation is induced; implantation of the fertilized eggs into the uterus is delayed until the following November to March. Births occur from January to April, after a total gestation period of 215-270 days. Maternal dens are located in alpine, subalpine, taiga, or tundra habitat; reports of dens in low elevation, densely forested habitats are rare. Dens in Alaska are usually long, complex snow tunnels with no associated trees or boulders. In Idaho , dens are associated with fallen trees or boulders. In both areas, all dens are covered with at least 1 m of snow. Litter size is one to five; usually two to four. The young weigh about 84 g at birth and are born fully furred, but with their eyes closed. Weaning occurs after seven to eight weeks, and adultsize is reached by November, when the young separate from the mother. Females raise the young alone. Sexual maturity is attained after two or three years.","Mainly nocturnal, but occasionally active during the day. Rest sites may be a rough bed of grass or leaves in a cave or rock crevice, in a burrow made by another animal, or under a fallen tree. In Alberta and British Columbia , resting sites were located on top of the snow in relatively open locations that offered good visibility of the surroundings. Wolverines do not appear to be hindered by deep snow and are active year round.",,"Classified as Near Threatened in The IUCN Red Listt. Wolverines are harvested for their pelt; although their fur is not used widely in commerce it is valued for parkas. Fur trapping has contributed to a decline in numbers and distribution of the Wolverine. Wolverines are also intensely hunted because they are considered a nuisance animal: they follow traplines and devour trapped furbearers, they break into cabins and food caches, they allegedly prey on domestic reindeer, and they attack sheep.

They sometimes occur in gardens, plantations, and in agricultural fields. Tayras may hunt in grasslands, although much of their time is spent in forested areas. In the Ilanos of Venezuela , Tayras are usually found along gallery forests; at night, they may cross extensive grasslands, presumably moving from one forest to another. In Veracruz , Mexico , Tayras generally are restricted to forested habitats. They are found in the Atlantic rainforest of Brazil , in deciduous and scrub forest of the Pantanal in Paraguay and Bolivia , and in gallery and scrub forest and tall grass savannas in Argentina , Bolivia , and Paraguay . In Belize , no significant habitat preference was found for the Tayra.","The diet includes fruits, small vertebrates, insects, and carrion. In Venezuela , three species of vertebrate (Echimys semivillous, Rhipidomys sp., and Iguana iguana) and four species of fruit (Genipa americana, Zanthozylum culantrillo, Guazuma tomentosa, and Psychotria anceps) were recorded from 18 scats; both FE. semivillous and G. americana were found in 50% of the scats. In Belize , four species of small mammals were found in 31 scats: Didelphis marsupialis (9-6%), Oryzomys palustris (22-5%), Sigmodon hispidus (32:3%), and Rattus rattus (29-0%). In addition, 19-4% small birds, 58-0% arthropods, and 67-7% fruit were found. The primary fruit eaten was Calocarpum mammosum. Additional fruits consumed included Cecropia mexicana, Astrocaryum standleyanum, and Spondias mombin. Prey and other foods are detected primarily by smell, as its eyesight is relatively poor. Prey are captured after persistent chases; the Tayra does not stalk or ambush prey.","In captivity, breeding activity of adult Tayras occurs during the day. However, on Barro Colorado Island, Panama , two males and one female may have engaged in nocturnal sexual behavior. Males appear ready to mate year round and can reproduce by 18 months of age. Female Tayras have their first estrus at about 22 months of age; the estrous cycle is c. 52 days in young females and c. 94 days in older females. Females enter estrus several times each year for periods of 3-20 days. Gestation lasts 63-67 days. Delayed implantation does not occur. Tayras give birth to one to three young, but two are most common. In the wild, males do not remain with females, who raise the young alone. The young are born blind, covered in fur, and weigh about 100 g . The ears open at 27-34 days and the eyes open at 35-47 days. Deciduous teeth begin emerging at day 36 and are completely erupted by day 99. Permanent teeth appear at day 115 and are completely emerged by day 224. The young consume solid food by day 70 and are weaned by day 100. Five stages of development have been defined. First is the infant stage, days 1-50, during which the young suckle and do not leave the den. During days 50-75, the fledgling stage, the young leave the den for short periods, and solid food is provided by the mother, in addition to milk. The weaning stage, days 75-100, includes exploratory excursions, with independent feeding on fruits and insects. During the transition stage, days 100-200, the birth den is abandoned, the young are weaned, and they begin to hunt with their mother and kill prey on their own. During dispersal, days 200-300, family bonds break down and the young go their separate ways. The young reach adult size at six months. When outside the den, the young and mother use a clicking call to maintain contact if they are not within sight of one another. Mothers are protective of their young and will carry them by the middle of the body when a threatis perceived. This protective behavior persists as the young grow and mothers may also carry or drag them back to the den by their necks or ears. Prey-catching ability develops slowly and is learned. When only three months old, the young will follow and bite rodents and small birds on the rump or limbs. Through experience, bite placement is improved, resulting in killing bites to the base of the skull. The mother will bring wounded prey to her young and release it for them to catch and kill.","Primarily diurnal, with peaks of activity in the early morning and late afternoon. On occasion, some nocturnal activity may occur, especially near human habitations. Rest sites are in hollow trees or underground burrows.",,"Classified as Least Concern in The IUCN Red List. The Tayra is considered common throughout most ofits range. However, the range of E. b. senex has been greatly reduced in Mexico because of the destruction of tropical forests and the spread of agriculture.

Preferred habitats are mature old-growth spruce-fir communities, with greater than 30% canopy cover, a well-established understory of fallen logs and stumps, and lush shrub and forb vegetation. They avoid large open spaces such as clearcuttings, but may use riparian areas, meadows, forest edges, and rocky alpine areas above the timberline. In the coastal forests of California, American Martens select the largest available patches of old-growth, old-growth and late-mature, or serpentine habitat; dense, spatially extensive shrub cover is a key habitat element. In Alberta , during the winter, American Martens use young forests, and mature/old coniferous and deciduous stands, according to their availability. In the Selkirk and Purcell Mountains of south-west Canada , American Martens were detected in all habitats sampled including recently logged areas, regenerating stands, dry Douglas-fir (Pseudosuga menziesii) forest and subalpine parkland. They selected for greater crown closure and older stands at the finer resolution; no selection for forest structure was detected at the larger resolution except that American Martens selected against increased overstory heterogeneity. They preferred coniferous stands over deciduous-dominated stands and were more abundant in wetter than in dryer areas. In a clearcut boreal landscape in western Quebec , in which black spruce (Picea mariana) is the predominant forest type , American Martens avoid open regenerating stands composed mostly of recent clearcuts with sparse regeneration. They do not select coniferous stands, even those that are mature or overmature, but prefer deciduous and mixed stands, a large proportion of which has a dense coniferous shrub layer. Winter home ranges usually contain less than 30-35% open or closed regenerating stands and more than 40-50% uncut forest. In south-eastern Labrador, American Martens avoid areas with low productivity and low canopy cover (<20%), but show no selection for tree species composition or cover among more productive forests. In eastern Newfoundland, mature coniferous forest is the dominant cover type in most American Marten home ranges and is the only forest type used proportionately more than its availability by resident individuals. Otherforest types used in proportion to their availability include coniferous scrub and insect-defoliated stands; open areas and sites recently disturbed by fire are avoided at this scale. In northern Maine, in an area where trapping and timber harvesting had been excluded for more than 35 years, American Martens were found to use nearly all the available habitat, although during the summer, they preferred stands that had substantial mortality caused by spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana). Mature, well-stocked coniferous forest was the least abundant forest type in the home ranges of both sexes, in both seasons, whereas mature, well-stocked deciduous forest was the most abundant.","The diet consists mostly of rodents and other small mammals, including voles, mice, chipmunks, squirrels (7amiasciurus and Glaucomys sp.), and lagomorphs, especially the Snowshoe Hare. Other food items include birds, eggs, reptiles, amphibians, invertebrates (insects, earthworms), fruits, and berries. In Newfoundland, Meadow Voles were the most prevalent food item found in scats (80% in summer and 47-5% in winter); Snowshoe Hares occurred in 28% of winter samples, and 16% other food types were found in scats during each season. In the mixed-conifer forests of southern Sierra Nevada , where the American Marten and Fisher are sympatric, the diet of Fishers appeared to include more remains of birds, lizards, hypogeous fungi, and insects than that of American Martens. However, the dietary overlap between these two species was high. The diets of both species were more diverse than previously reported in North America, perhaps due to the absence or rarity of large prey (Snowshoe Hares and North American Porcupines) or to a greater diversity of available prey types in the southern Sierra Nevada . American Martens hunt and find food by constant searching, sometimes in trees, and often tunnel under snow during winter to search for microtines.","Mating occurs from July to August. Implantation ofthe fertilized eggs into the uterus is delayed for 190-250 days; embryonic development is about 28 days. Total gestation period is thus 220-275 days. The young are born in late March or April, usually in a hollow tree or arboreal cavity; the natal nest is lined with dry vegetation. In the Sierra Madre Range, Wyoming , natal and maternal dens included rock crevices (28%), snags (25%), Red Squirrel (Tamasciurus hudsonicus) middens (19%), and logs (16%). Littersize is one to five, usually two to three. Neonates weigh c. 28 g , open their eyes after 39 days, are weaned after six weeks, and reach adult size after three months. Sexual maturity is attained at 15-24 months.","Primarily nocturnal and crepuscular, but can be active during the day. Den/rest sites are in hollow logs ortrees, in rock crevices, or in burrows. Large logs, large snags, and large, live spruce and fir trees are important characteristics for den sites in the central Rocky Mountains. Squirrels provide important denning structures as well as prey for American Martens.",,"Classified as Least Concern in The IUCN Red List. American Martens are considered common in some parts of their range, and are legally harvested for the fur trade. However, by the early 20"" century, excessive trapping had severely depleted the American Marten in many areas, particularly in Alaska, Canada , and western United States . Protective regulations subsequently allowed the species to make a comeback in some areas and reintroduction programs have been carried out in Michigan , Wisconsin , and parts of north-eastern USA and south-eastern Canada .",Buskirk (1984) | Buskirk & MacDonald (1984) | Clark et al.

They also occur in fragmented forests, hedgerows, and cultivated areas, and in close proximity to humans. They are generally found in more open environments than other marten species and appear to avoid conifer forests. In a fragmented agricultural landscape, Stone Martens were found to prefer areas with wood and scrub vegetation and watercourses with continuous vegetation along their verges; they tended to avoid arable land.","The diet consists of rodents, birds, eggs, reptiles, amphibians,insects, fruits, and berries. In France , voles (Microtus sp.) make up to 30-55% of the total diet; there is strong seasonality, with microtines eaten more often in winter and spring. In the Swiss Jura, mammals are the main prey, representing 37-9% ofall food items; Water Voles (Arvicola terrestris) were found in 90-4% of scats during peak vole numbers. In central Italy , fruit and berries are the staple diet, but mammals and birds are also important; the diet varies seasonally in relation to resource availability, with a predominance of fruit in autumn and insects in summer. In east-central Italy , the winter diet is almost completely frugivorous; fruit represents 84% of the total volume in the diet, with a 55% occurrence.

In south-eastern Romania , birds (45-2% of the biomass) and mammals (36-1%) predominate in the diet; reptiles, amphibians, insects, and fruits are supplementary food. In the Caucasus, the diet is 85% murine rodents during the summer; vegetable matter forms a major part of the late summer and early fall food in some areas.","Mating occurs in summer, but because of delayed implantation of the fertlized eggs into the uterus, births do not occur until the following spring.

In Norway , they prefer spruce-dominated forests with large trees, and avoid clearcuts and open habitats. In north-east Belarus , the higher food abundance in woodlands on clay soil results in a higher population density and a more even distribution of European Pine Martens than in woodlands on sandy soil, where they mainly live in valley habitats.","The diet consists of small mammals (including mice, voles, and squirrels), birds, amphibians, invertebrates, honey, fruits, and berries. In western Scotland , European Pine Martens prey extensively on small mammals (particularly Field Voles Microtus agrestis) and birds. Invertebrates are also important dietary items, with a high intake of beetles (particularly Geotrupes sp.) from March to September. Predation on birds and the intake of earthwormsis highest during the winter;fruits (bramble and rowan berries) are also important in autumn and late winter. In the Scottish Highlands, the diet is very varied and includes small mammals, large mammal carrion, birds, insects, and fruits. Small mammals are consistently important, whereas large mammal carrion, fruits and insects, are seasonal; birds are eaten at all times of the year, but are not a major part of the diet. Although appearing to be opportunist feeders, European Pine Martens did have strong food preferences: of the small mammals eaten, 94% were Field Voles. Insect species were also selectively eaten. Beetles (Geotrupes stercorosus, Carabus sp., and Serica brunnea) and Hymenoptera (Vespula vulgaris and Bonibus spp.) were consumed in large numbers when encountered. The diet indicated that European Pine Martens foraged on the ground, in glade areas within the forest, around night-time. In northern boreal Finland , the analysis of 5677 scats revealed that the European Pine Marten is an opportunistic generalist;its most favored food being small rodents (especially Clethrionomys sp.). Snow cover decreased the consumption of Microtus sp., but not Clethrionomys sp. or the Wood Lemming (Myopus schisticolor). Other food items were: Eurasian Red Squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris), Mountain Hare (Lepus timidus), carcasses of Reindeer, eggs, birds, common frog (Rana temporaria), berries, and mushrooms. In north-east Belarus , the diet includes rodents, birds, fruits, and carrion. In woodlands on sandy soil, European Pine Martens specialize in feeding on carrion in the cold season and on berries in the warm season. In winter, Bank Vole densities and the biomass of carrion are crucial food factors. In central Poland , where the European Pine Marten and Stone Marten are sympatric, both species feed mainly on small rodents, birds, and fruits. Although there is a high overlap in the trophic niches of both species, European Pine Martens feed more frequently on rodents and birds and Stone Martens on fruits and insects. In north-west Spain , mammals constitute the main prey all year round (50% ingested biomass), followed by fruit (28-1%), birds (20-9%), insects (0-8%) and reptiles (0-2%). Small mammals are the major prey species (41:6% ingested biomass), mainly Apodemus sp. (19-1%). Mammals are the most consumed prey in spring (65:8%) and winter (79-5%). However, in summer and autumn, European Pine Martens feed mainly on rowanberries (Sorbus aucuparia) (summer: 49-7%, autumn: 59-9%), followed by mammals (summer: 27-2%, autumn: 30-9%). On the island of Minorca , a total of 28 different food items were identified in 723 scats. Small mammals were the most important food overall, constituting 34% of the volume. During March to April, small mammals were the principal food consumed (63% of volume), followed by birds (19%). From May to June, birds were the main food (40%), followed by small mammals. Plant material and insects were the most important foods from July to August, when they made up 68% ofthe diet. Excess food may be cached for later use.","Mating occurs in mid-summer, but because of delayed implantation of the fertilized eggs into the uterus, births do not take place until March or April of the following year. Total gestation is 230-275 days. During the breeding season, captive females exhibited one to four periods of sexual receptivity, which usually lasted one to four days and recurred at intervals of 6-17 days. Litter size is two to eight, usually three to five. In Great Britain , natal dens comprise buildings (44:3%), trees (22:8%), other man-made structures (17-1%), and rocks (14-:3%). At birth, the young weigh about 30 g . Their eyes open after 32-38 days, weaning occurs after six or seven weeks, and the young separate from the mother in the autumn. Sexual maturity is attained in the second year.","Mainly nocturnal. On the island of Minorca , radio-collared European Pine Martens were primarily nocturnal, being active at night 53% of the time in autumn/winter and 59% in spring; daytime activity levels were 19% and 14%, respectively. In Poland , radio-telemetry revealed that 69% of the martens’ active time was during the night. The activity rhythms of European Pine Martens vary between sexes and seasons. In spring, male activity peaks at 20:00-00:00 h, whereas in summer and autumn/winter, activity is bimodal, peaking at 18:00-22:00 h and 02:00-04:00 h. Female activity in spring is more evenly distributed than that of males, but in summer their activity peaks at 20:00-00:00 h. In autumn/winter, females have a bimodal rhythm, with peaks at 18:00-20:00 h and 02:00-06:00 h. In breeding females, activity rhythms change in the course of pregnancy and nursing. On average, European Pine Martensstart their activity 73 min before sunset and finish 87 min after sunrise. Females became active earlier than males, but both sexes terminate their activity at the same time. On average, both sexes are active for around nine hours per day; they decrease their activity from 13 hours per day on warm days to 2-5 hours per day on cooler days. The number of activity bouts per day varies from one to six (mean 2:6); the activity bouts of males are significantly longer (4 hours, on average) than those of females (3 hours). In the cold season, the duration of short inactive bouts increases and inactivity lasts longer in females than in males. Den/restsites are in hollow trees or logs, under debris, or under snow. In Great Britain , most dens are associated with trees (44-3%), rocks (27-6%) and buildings (13-:8%); 69-6% of all dens are elevated, although only 9-8% are in elevated tree cavities, perhaps indicating a scarcity of arboreal cavities.",,"Classified as Least Concern in The IUCN Red List.

In north-eastern Canada and United States , they also occur in fragmented, mixed woodlots interspersed with agricultural land. In California , mid-seral Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and white fir (Abies concolor) forest types compose the greatest proportion of Fisher home ranges in the Coastal Mountains; the greatest proportion of home ranges in the Sierra Nevadas are in the intermediate tree size class with dense canopy closure, and in mixed conifer forests. In south-central Maine , Fishers use a variety of forest types , especially during summer. During winter, they hunt intensively in dense patches of coniferous undergrowth (where Snowshoe Hare tracks are common) and use deciduous stands less than expected by availability.","The diet includes lagomorphs (especially the Snowshoe Hare), North American Porcupines, ungulate carrion, small mammals, birds, reptiles, invertebrates, and fruit. During the winter in British Columbia , 18 types of mammalian and avian prey were found in 256 stomachs. The most commonly occurring prey species were Snowshoe Hares, Red Squirrels, and Southern Red-backed Voles. The diet varied between sexes: female fishers consumed small prey more frequently than did males. In the mountains of California’s Sierra Nevada , where the Snowshoe Hare and North American Porcupine are absent, other mammals are the most frequent food item; however, reptiles (20-4%) and insects (55-7%) are major components of the diet, and at least six fungal species are also eaten. In the mixed-conifer forests of the southern Sierra Nevada , where Fishers and American Martens occur together, the diets of both species are more diverse than reported elsewhere in North America. Although the diet of Fishers includes more birds,lizards, hypogeous fungi, and insects than that of American Martens, the dietary overlap is high. The great diversity of the diet in these two species may be due to the absence or rarity of large prey (such as Snowshoe Hares and North American Porcupines) or to a greater diversity of available prey types in the southern Sierra Nevada compared to other areas. In south-eastern Manitoba , Fishers prey heavily on Snowshoe Hares (84:3% frequency occurrence). In Vermont , most of the diet is mammalian (72%), with avian prey (15%) and fruit (10%) of secondary importance. In south-central Maine , winter foods include apples, porcupines, hares, Eastern Gray Squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis), Red Squirrels, Northern Flying Squirrels (Glaucomys sabrinus), mice (Peromyscus), voles (Clethrionomys gapperi and Microtus), and shrews (Sorex and Blarina). The fall and winter diet in West Virginia and Maryland includes ten mammal species, four bird species, one gastropod species, and two types of vegetation. White-tailed Deer (Odocoileus virginianus) is the most frequent dietary component. Medium-sized mammals such as Northern Raccoon and small mammals such as Peromyscus sp. are also major dietary components, although small mammals occur less frequently than reported elsewhere. Diet overlap between the sexes was found to be considerable and differences between the sexes in the occurrence of major food groups (small mammals, medium-sized mammals, large mammals, birds, and fruit) were not significant. Hunting strategies vary with prey type . Snowshoe Hares are caught after rapid zig-zagging chases. Fishers hunt porcupines by searching for their dens. The arboreal skills of Fishers enable them to chase porcupines down trees to the ground, where they kill them after lengthy attacks, during which the Fisher repeatedly bites the porcupine’s face (which is unprotected by quills).","Mating occurs from March to May. Implantation of the fertilized eggs into the uterus is delayed and births occur from January to early April. Litter size is up to six, but averages two to three. Natal and maternal dens are located high up in hollow trees. The young weigh less than 50 g and are born with their eyes and ears closed. The eyes open around seven weeks, weaning begins after two to three months, and separation occurs in the fifth month. Females reach adult weight after six months and males after one year.","Active during the day and night; most activity occurs shortly before sunrise and after sunset. Males and females show similar amounts of activity, and both sexes are active more frequently in summer than winter. Den/rest sites are in hollow logs or trees, brush piles, or in rock crevices. Fishers in California select restsites in forested areas that have dense canopies, large trees, and steep slopes. In the Coastal Mountains and Sierra Nevada in California , standing trees (live and dead) are the most common resting structures, with California black oak (Quercus kelloggit) and Douglas-fir the most frequent species in the Sierra and Coastal areas, respectively. Resting structures are within the largest diameter trees available, averaging 117- 3 cm for live conifers, 119- 8 cm for conifer snags, and 69 cm for hardwoods. Females use cavity structures more often than males, while males use platform structures significantly more than females. The diversity of types and sizes of rest structures used by males suggests that males are less selective than females. In the Sierra Nevada study area, where surface water is less common, Fishers prefer rest sites within 100 m of water. In a central hardwood forest, Fishers were found to rest in hardwood, softwood, and mixedwood forest types in proportion to their availability in the summer, but tended to avoid hardwood areas in winter. They used nests, cavities, and burrows in proportionto their availability in winter, but in the summer, Fishers preferred nests to cavities, and burrows were not used. Males tended to use larger cavity trees and mixed forest stands more often than females. During spring, summer, and fall in south-central Maine , Fishers prefer using rest sites in the branches of conifers, within coniferous stands.",,"Classified as Least Concern in The IUCN Red List. Fishers are considered common throughout most of their range, particularly in Canada , but they may be threatened in the western USA . They are trapped for their fur. In the 19"" and early 20™ centuries, excessive fur trapping and habitat destruction through logging led to a decline in Fisher populations over most ofits range. Closed hunting seasons, protective regulations, and reintroductions were then initiated in many areas.

Destruction of prairie dog colonies for the sake of agriculture led to a decline in Black-footed Ferret numbers and eventually they became so rare that many people considered them to be extinct. However, unconfirmed sigh things continued from several states, and in 1981 a small population of Black-footed Ferrets was discovered in Wyoming. Intensive field studies were initiated, and byJuly 1984, the population was estimated to contain 129 individuals. However, the number of ferrets then began to fall, apparently due to a decline in their prairie dog prey; also, canine distemper was somehow introduced into the wild population. By 1987, the remaining 18 individuals were brought into captivity to start a breeding program. By 1991, there were 180 individuals in captivity and 49 ferrets were released into south-eastern Wyoming; 91 more were released in 1992, and another 48 in 1993.

In south-Western Europe, radio-collared European Mink used areas that had low forest cover and bramble or shrub cover along the riverbank; they avoided areas with dense forest cover. In south-western France , radio-collared European Mink had a strong preference for flooded habitats, particularly open marshes, flooded woodlands, and moorlands; they seldom left riparian forest corridors.","The diet includes small mammals, birds, amphibians, fish, molluscs, crabs, and insects. The chief prey is often the Water Vole. In northern Spain , scat analysis revealed a diet based on small mammals (relative frequency of occurrence 36:9%), fish (30-6%), and birds (17-8%). The Wood Mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus) was the most consumed small mammal and cyprinids (mainly Barbus sp.) were the most frequently eaten fish. The average size of consumed fish was 13- 5 cm , and the average weight was 31- 5 g ; males ate larger and heavierfish than females.

The European Mink has declined over much of its former range and has been extirpated from Austria , Bulgaria , Czech Republic , Germany , Hungary , Montenegro , Poland , Serbia , and Slovakia . Habitat loss and degradation is a serious threat in many parts of Europe. Ongoing destruction and degradation of freshwater and associated terrestrial habitats has been caused by hydroelectric development, river channelization, and water pollution. Although its fur is not as valuable as that of the American Mink, the European Mink was widely trapped for commercial purposes. It is now legally protected in all range states and at least part of the population occurs within protected areas. However, accidental trapping still poses a threat. In France , secondary poisoning and trapping of European Mink has occurred as a result of efforts to control Coypu (Myocastor coypus) and small carnivore species. Accidental mortality through vehicle collisions is a problem in some areas. Competition with the American Mink (an alien invasive species) has been hypothesized as a contributing factor. In Spain and France , hybridization with the European Polecat may also be a threat. Field studies have been undertaken to determine its ecological requirements, to analyse the causes of its decline, and to assess the genetic variability of western populations. In Spain and France , programmes have been started to control the American Mink population. A captive breeding programme was launched in 1992 under the European Zoo Association. Reintroduction efforts are underway in Germany and Russia . The European Mink has recently colonized and spread into northern Spain ; it was absent from this country before 1950.

They are also found near human habitations.","The diet is mainly small rodents, but other small mammals (such as lagomorphs, moles, and squirrels), birds, eggs, lizards, frogs, salamanders, insects (mostly beetles), fish, worms, and carrion are also occasionally eaten. The proportions of different small rodent species in the diet roughly reflects their relative abundances throughout the year. In Europe and Russia , Microtus agrestris, M. arvalis, M. oeconomus, M. brandti, Arvicola terrestris, Clethrionomys glareolus, C. rutilus, Apodemus sylvaticus, Lemmus lemmus, and L. sibiricus are preyed upon. In North America, M. pennsylvanicus, M. ochrogastere, C. rutilus, C. gapperi, Peromyscus leucopus, P. maniculatus, Reithrodontomys megalotis, Sigmodon hispidus, Dicrostonyx rubricatus, D. hudsonicus, and L. sibiricus are eaten. In Great Britain , one study showed that the diet consists of 68% rodents (mainly Microtus agrestis), 25% lagomorphs, and 5% birds and birds’ eggs. The small size of Least Weasels enables them to pursue prey into their burrows, so much of their hunting is underground or under snow. Males readily shift to larger prey such as birds, lagomorphs, and Water Voles, while females continue to search for Field Voles. Thus, males generally take larger prey than females and spend less time hunting in tunnels. Least Weasels take five to ten meals per day. Excess food may be stored, especially in the winter; the cache site may be within the home burrow or near a kill. Killing behavior is innate. Least Weasels respond to movements of prey as a stimulus for attack. The killing bite is delivered at the nape of the neck and penetrates the base of the skull or throat area.","Breeding may continue throughout the year, even during the winter, but is concentrated in spring and late summer. Delayed implantation does not occur and the gestation period is 34-37 days.Litter size may reach ten, but usually is four to five. Females can have more than one litter annually; second and third litters within a single year may occur during peaks of rodent abundance. Births occur in a burrow or rock crevice; the nest is lined with grass and other material. Females raise the young alone. Newborns are blind, naked, and weigh 1-2 g . The eyes open at 26-30 days, and the young are weaned after 42-56 days. They leave their mother at 9-12 weeks. Adult size is reached after 12-15 weeks. Females reach sexual maturity at three months and may produce a litter in their first summer.","Active day and night. The high-energy requirements of Least Weasels mean that they have to be constantly active, so active and rest periods occur in rapid succession. However, the timing and extent of their daily activity is related to the activity patterns of their prey. Least Weasels may spend the whole winter under snow. Den/ rest sites are in prey burrows, in rock piles, or in other well-concealed sites. Vocalizations in captive animals consist of a repertoire of five different sounds, including a chirp, a hiss, a trill, a squeal, and a squeak.",,"Classified as Least Concern in The IUCN Red List. The Least Weasel is considered relatively common in Eurasia, but appears to be rare in North America. They are not known to prey on domestic animals and are beneficial to people through its destruction of mice and rats. However, Least Weasels have been introduced to some areas, such as New Zealand , with sometimes devastating effects on the local fauna.

They sometimes occur near humans, but avoid dense urban areas.","The diet consists of amphibians, small mammals, birds, fish, and invertebrates. In Switzerland , the diet of European Polecats is almost exclusively carnivorous, but somefruits are also eaten, mainly by juveniles. Anurans (frogs and toads; mainly Rana temporaria and Bufo bufo) are the staple food. Other foods of importance are small mammals (mainly Muridae, but also Microtidae and Soricidae), carrion, and eggs. The anuran proportion of the diet is higher in summer than in winter and higher in the mountains than in the lowlands. In mountainous regions, anurans are also the most important food in winter. Juveniles eat more fruits and invertebrates and fewer mammals than adults. Sex-related differences in the importance of the main food categories have not been detected. In Denmark , the stomach contents of 47 European Polecats revealed that they preyed mostly on amphibians (87%) and mammals (34%), and only occasionally on birds (9%) and fish (6%). In Poland , the analysis of 222 scats revealed that anurans (mainly R . temporaria) comprised 70 to 98% of the biomass consumed and were found in 60 to 95% of scats. Forest rodents (Apodemus flavicollis and Clethrionomys glareolus) constituted from 1-29% of the biomass eaten. The consumption of rodents grew with decreasing winter temperature and increasing numbers of rodents. Snow-tracking of individual European Polecats has shown that in wet forests, they move in close proximity to watercourses to search for anurans, whereas in the drier forests, they hunt rodents, mainly by digging. European Polecats constantly move as they search for prey, exploring burrows, hollow logs,trees, tree cavities, rock crevices, and farm buildings.","Mating occurs from March to June. The gestation period is about 42 days. Litter size is typically three to seven, but may be up to twelve. Neonates are blind and weigh 9-10 g . They open their eyes and are weaned after about one month, and become independent at around three months. Sexual maturity may be reached during the first year.","Mainly nocturnal, but can be crepuscular and active during the day. In Luxembourg , radio-collared European Polecats were 62% active during the night. Males were more active than females, and activity increased from winter to summer. In central Italy , ten males and six females were monitored using radio-telemetry. Males exhibited a regular and constant nocturnal pattern in every season, preferring the time between 20:00-06:00 h; activity was lower at dawn and dusk, and scarce during daylight hours. Females were significantly diurnal and crepuscular, but individuals revealed a flexibility in their activity pattern, including arrhythmic patterns without apparent temporal organization. Den/rest sites include crevices, hollow logs, burrows made by other animals, and sometimes buildings. In Luxembourg , European Polecats were located in 53 different resting sites, during the day. Aboveground shelters were used more often than underground shelters. Piles of branches, barns and stables, garden sheds and rat dens, were the most used sites, without specific preference for any one type of shelter. However, buildings seem to be of prime importance during severe weather conditions.",,"Classified as Least Concern in The IUCN Red List. In Western Europe, the European Polecat was widely hunted for sport and fur and persecuted as a pest. However, these threats have become less seriousas this species is now protected in a number of range states, and rates of hunting have greatly reduced. Accidental mortality from car collisions and secondary rodenticide poisoning are threats. In Russia and Morocco , this species is commonly hunted.

They prefer densely vegetated areas and are sometimes found far from water. Females have been found to prefer small streams, whereas males prefer large streams.","The diet includes small mammals,fish, birds, eggs, amphibians, reptiles, and invertebrates, such as crustaceans, molluscs, insects, and earthworms. In much of North America, the American Mink is a major predator of Muskrats; fluctuations in Muskrat populations have a direct effect on American Mink abundance. In Eurasia, where the American Mink has been introduced, the staple food items on rivers and streamsare fish (average, 27%), mammals (30%), and amphibians (17%), whereas on lakes and ponds,it is predominantly birds (33%) and fish (28%). On the upper reaches of the Lovatriver, north-east Belarus , three out of ten American Mink were found to be small mammal specialists; 86-92% of their scats contained remains of small rodents (mostly the Water Vole and microtines), and small mammals constituted 83-88% of the food biomass consumed; the other seven were generalist predators. In western Poland , the diet of American Mink consists mainly of mammals, birds, and fish. In autumn-winter, mammals constitute up to 56%, fish up to 62%, and birds 4-16%, of the biomass consumed. In spring and summer, however, birds form 45-60% of the biomass eaten; the common coot (Fulica atra) is the most frequently consumed prey. Scat analysis in eastern Poland revealed that American Mink relied on three prey groups: fish (40% in spring-summer and 10% in autumnwinter), frogs (32% and 51%, respectively), and small mammals (21% and 36%). Of the available small mammal species, American Mink strongly selected the Root Vole (Microtus oeconomus). The cold season diet depended on river size. On small rivers with forested valleys, American Mink fed nearly exclusively on amphibians (72-90% of food biomass). As the size of a river increases and riverside habitat becomes more open (sedge and reed marshes instead of forest), American Mink shift to preying on small mammals (up to 65% in the diet). The stomach contents of 211 individuals in Thy, Denmark , revealed that the diet was mostly mammals (55% occurrence), followed by amphibians (36%), birds (33%), and fish (30%). In Bornholm, Denmark , American Mink prey mostly on birds (50%), followed by mammals (42%), fish (25%) and amphibians (4%). In Italy , the diet is mainly fish, followed by small mammals and birds. American Mink spend most of their time hunting near water, but can also hunt underwater. In a coastal environment of Scotland , radio-tracked American Mink were found to forage selectively at low or mid-tide and within the core areas of their home range; they showed no preference for areas rich in prey when foraging at high tide and between core areas. They also avoided areas with freshwater streams and preferred foraging in the mid-tide zone. Prey on land are detected by sight or sound. Surplus food is sometimes cached.","Females are polyestrous but only have one litter per year. Mating occurs from February to April. Implantation of the fertilized eggs into the uterus undergoes a short and variable delay, and gestation may last from 39 to 78 days (average 51 days). Actual embryonic development takes 30-32 days. Births occur in April to June. Litter size ranges from two to ten, with an average offive. The young are born blind; their eyes open after five weeks and weaning occursat five to six weeks. They leave the nest and begin to hunt at seven to eight weeks, and separate from the mother in the autumn. Females reach adult weight at four months and sexual maturity at twelve months; males reach adult weight at 9-11 months and sexual maturity at 18 months.","Mainly nocturnal, but with frequent periods of daytime activity, especially in areas away from humans. Den/rest sites are in burrows, hollow logs, hollow trees, rock crevices, old buildings, or abandoned dwellings of Muskrats, American Beavers, or Woodchucks (Marmota sp.). Burrows may be about 3 m long and 1 m beneath the surface, and have one or more entrancesjust above the water level. On the northern Iberian Peninsula, radio-collared American Mink selected resting places within dense scrub,close to deep water.

Spotted Hyenas have been extirpated from many areas of southern Africa.",,"Spotted Hyenas occupy an extraordinarily diverse array of habitats, including savanna, semi-desert, swamps, woodland, and montane forest up to 4000 m of elevation, but are absent in lowland tropical rainforests, in alpine areas at high elevation, and in extreme desert conditions. Although they require water for drinking, they are able to make do with very little water, and seldom require access to it. Even lactating females can survive without water for over one week. The highest population densities reported for this species occur on the prey-rich plains of Kenya and Tanzania , and surprisingly, in the forests of the Aberdare Mountains in Kenya . In these areas, densities of Spotted Hyenas exceed one animal per square kilometer.","The foraging behavior of Spotted Hyenas is remarkably flexible. Long believed to feed mainly on carrion, these animals are in fact efficient predators that kill 60% to 95% of their prey themselves. On average across populations in which the relative proportions of hunted and scavenged foods have been documented, two thirds of their diet is derived from kills they make themselves, and only one third from scavenged food items. In addition to being able to obtain food either by hunting or scavenging, Spotted Hyenas exhibit extraordinary plasticity with respect to their prey preferences. Spotted Hyenas have catholic tastes, they are extreme opportunists, and they are able to exploit a vast array of potential prey types , ranging from caterpillars to elephants; they may also occasionally consume some plant material. However, in most parts of Africa, Spotted Hyenas derive the large majority of their food intake from only a small subset of the prey species available to them locally. In most environments, they focus on the local mediumand large-sized ungulates, capture of which yields the greatest caloric return while demanding the least effort and the fewest risks. Thus, in eastern Africa, Spotted Hyenas prey most frequently on Blue Wildebeest, zebra, gazelles and Topi. In the arid parts of southern Africa, they prey most frequently on Gemsbok. In Kruger National Park, their most common prey is Impala, and in western Africa, common prey includes Red-fronted Gazelles and Hartebeest. Foraging behavior varies with the prey currently sought. Spotted Hyenas search for gazelle fawns by wandering upwind through open grassland in a zig-zag pattern. They may dig for crocodile eggs along large rivers, and snap flying termites out of the air with their jaws. When hunting, Spotted Hyenas modify their behavior to take advantage of the most abundant prey species, or the species thatis easiest to catch; these change seasonally in some localities with the migratory movements of particular ungulate species. Instead of using felid-like stealth as a primary hunting tactic, Spotted Hyenas rely on their extraordinary endurance for success in hunting. They can run at speeds of up to 55 km /h, but at slightly lower speeds, they can maintain a chase for several kilometres. If the antelope being chased becomes winded, and turns to defend itself with its horns, the Hyenas rush in and start tearing off pieces of the prey animal’s flesh. Like canids, Spotted Hyenas kill their prey by disembowelling and dismembering them rather than by using a particularkilling bite. Spotted Hyenas may hunt either solitarily or in groups; in the latter case group size varies with the type of prey sought. Mean hunting group sizes among Hyenas in Kenya are 1-2 for Topi, 1-7 for Impala, 2-08 for Thompson's Gazelle, 2-92 for Blue Wildebeest, and 9-1 for zebra. Thus only zebra hunts involve large groups of hunters, and most hunting parties contain only one or two Hyenas. Ungulates such as Topi and Blue Wildebeest weigh roughly three times as much as an adult Hyena, but solitary Hyenas routinely kill these antelope. Although hunting group size is often surprisingly small among Spotted Hyenas, the feeding groups formed by these animals are often very large once a prey animal has been killed. The noise produced by feeding Hyenas often draws members of the clan that were not involved in the hunt to the kill site. Feeding competition among the Hyenas present at a kill is usually very intense. In East Africa, often more than 30 Hyenas can be observed trying to feed from a single carcass. Because of this intense competition, each individual Hyena consumes as much food as possible in a very short period of time. A group of 20-30 hungry Hyenas can reduce an adult Blue Wildebeest to nothing more than a pile of rumen contents in only 13 minutes. It is estimated that an adult Spotted Hyena can consume a mass of food equal to 25%-30% ofits body weight, and individual Hyenas have been observed to ingest up to 18 kg of meat and bone in one hour. However,as a result of limited access to carcasses, average food intake ranges only from 1-5 to 3-8 kg per day. Spotted Hyenas sometimes engage in kleptoparasitism, which is the aggressive acquisition of a fresh carcass from other predators. They have been observed displacingjackals, Striped Hyenas, Leopards, Cheetahs, and African Wild Dogs from kills. However Spotted Hyenas most frequently compete for kills with Lions. Spotted Hyenas and Lions occur sympatrically in many areas of Africa, and in most of these habitats, bi-directional food stealing has been observed between these two species. Dominance relations between Spotted Hyenas and competing species are not absolute but depend on the numerical presence of both parties. For instance, Lions usually displace Spotted Hyenas at kills. However, if Hyena group size is large and the ratio of Spotted Hyenas to female and subadult Lions exceeds four to one, Hyenas are often able to displace Lions from kills unless a male Lion is present. A single Spotted Hyena can usually dominate a Cheetah, Leopard, Striped Hyena, Brown Hyena, any species ofjackal, or an African Wild Dog. Spotted Hyenas have been observed caching surplus food in thickets and under water in ponds. These animals are very comfortable in water; they often play in seasonal pools, and lie in shallow water or wet mud to keep cool on hot days. Compared to the other bone-cracking hyenas, Spotted Hyenas rarely carry food to their young at dens. This appears to be because the risk of having one’s food stolen, even by much smaller hyenas,is very high at dens, particularly for low-ranking individuals.","Females bear young throughout the year in most parts of Africa, although there are distinct birth peaks and troughs in some populations. Both sexes mate promiscuously with multiple partners. Courtship by male Spotted Hyenas is unusual among mammals because it appears to reflect such extreme conflicting desires to approach the female and also to flee from her. Males often engage in approach-avoid and bowing displays, both of which appear to reflect strong motivational conflict and hesitancy on the part of the male. Their behavior suggests that interactions with females may be unusually risky for males in this species, and that males fear females. In general, the female seems to take little notice of the male hyena’s sexual advances. Estrus lasts 1-3 days, but the length of the female's cycle, and whether ovulation is spontaneous or induced, are not known. Copulation involves multiple mounts, intromissions, and ejaculations. Female receptivity is indicated by inhibited aggression toward the male and by assumption of a distinctive receptive stance in which the female lowers her head and keeps her mouth near the ground. The only behavior indicative of a female's interest in mating is that she may follow a male. Some males who sire cubs form consortships with females, but others do not, suggesting that individual male Hyenas may adopt multiple alternative reproductive tactics to attract and acquire mates. That is, male Hyenas may sometimes “shadow” or “guard” their mates, but intensive mate-guarding is not required to ensure that a male will sire the cubs of a particular female. Females have been observed mating with one to four males within a single estrous period, and multiple paternity has been documented to occur in 25-30% of twin litters. Many copulations among Crocuta appear to be infertile. Female Spotted Hyenas are exposed to high concentrations of androgens in utero, and this early androgen exposure may have negative effects on female fertility by altering ovarian histology or other mechanisms. It has recently been determined that early androgen exposure is not necessary for formation of the female's peniform clitoris. Females give birth through their penis-like clitoris. During parturition, the clitoris tears to permit the passage of the young, creating a large bleeding wound on the posterior surface that may take weeks to heal. Females usually produce litters of two, although singletons are also common, and triplets are observed occasionally. Cubs weigh roughly 1 kg at birth. They are born with their eyes open, their deciduous canine and incisor teeth fully erupted, and they are capable of remarkably coordinated movement immediately after birth. They are thus relatively precocial compared to cubs in other hyaenid species or in most other carnivores. Their coats are pure black at birth; cubs start to molt at 5-6 weeks of age, and the natal coat is completely replaced by an adult-colored, spotted pelage by 4-5 months of age. The spots never change except to fade a bit with age. Cubs are usually born in an isolated natal den and are transferred to the clan’s communal den when they are 2-5 weeks old. They remain at the communal den until they are 8-12 months old, and then begin traveling around the clan’s territory, initially with their mothers and later alone. As in the other bone-cracking hyenas, weaning occurs surprisingly late, usually around 13-14 months of age, but twin litters borne by low-ranking females may be nursed as long as two years. Fifty percent of cubs die before puberty, and mortality rates are generally highest immediately after weaning. Males reach reproductive maturity at around two years of age, and most females start bearing young in their third or fourth year. However, age at first parturition varies between two and six years. All females in a clan reproduce, and females rear their young together in the communal den. Therefore occupied dens may contain up to 30 young of different ages from up to 20 litters. Females nurse only their own cubs and usually reject approaches by other cubs. The milk of Spotted Hyenas has the highest protein content (mean 14-9%) recorded for any terrestrial carnivore, a fat content (mean 141%) exceeded only by that of palaearctic bears and the sea otter, and a higher gross energy density than the milk of most other terrestrial carnivores. Due to the high energy content of their milk, and the long nursing period, Spotted Hyenas have the highest energetic investment per litter of any carnivore. Reproductive success in both sexes is related to dominancestatus, although this relationship is stronger among females than males. High-ranking females enjoy greater reproductive success than low-ranking females because they have longer reproductive life spans and shorter inter-birth intervals, and because their cubs experience lower mortality than do cubs of low-ranking females. Sex ratios among adults are usually slightly female-biased. Reproductive success among males varies with intra-sexual rank, although alpha males fare more poorly than would be expected based on social status alone. As most males disperse from their natal clan when they are at least two years old, most breeding males are immigrants. Spotted Hyenas are sometimes referred to as the “Cain and Abel” of the animal world because of the common belief that they routinely kill their siblings shortly after birth. Although littermates do engage in aggressive interactions within minutes after birth, and although this can result in obvious scarring of the subordinate littermate, these aggressive interactions seldom result in the death of a sibling. These early fights quickly lead to the establishment of a dominance relationship that allows the dominant cub to control access to the mother’s milk. Siblicide in the Spotted Hyena is facultative in that it occurs only in some twin litters rather than routinely. The purpose of the early fighting is to establish an unambiguous dominance relationship within the litter. It appears that the relative costs and benefits of killing one’s sibling vary with current socio-ecological conditions: a cub that killsits sibling may obtain significant benefits if its mother is unable to support multiple cubs. However, mothers can usually support two cubs in many parts of Africa without undue difficulty.","Spotted Hyenas are predominantly nocturnal and crepuscular, although they may be active at midday when temperatures permit. Dens are typically modified holes dug by Aardvarks, although caves are used as den sites in some areas. Only cubslive in dens; adults sleep above ground, often in thickets, particularly when midday temperatures are high. Although Spotted Hyenas are active for roughly one third of each 24hour cycle, their activity is not continuous. Instead, activity occurs in bouts interspersed with periods of rest. Hyenas in Kenya that were followed for complete 24hour cycles spent 32% of their time active, but 53% of their active time occurred during hours of darkness.",,"Listed as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. The total world population of the Spotted Hyena is well above 10,000 individuals, several subpopulations exceed 1000 individuals and its range well exceeds 20,000 km ®. The rapid decline of populations outside conservation areas due to persecution and habitat loss makes the species increasingly dependent on the continued existence of protected areas. Spotted Hyenas have been extirpated in Algeria and Lesotho , and they are listed as threatened in Benin , Burundi , Cameroon , Mauritania , Niger , Nigeria , Rwanda , and Sierra Leone . The largest remaining populations are found in Kenya , Tanzania , South Africa , and Namibia . Most adult mortality is caused directly by lions and humans,although disease is an important mortality source in some areas. Human-caused mortality is common even inside protected areas. Spotted Hyenas may attack livestock, particularly where natural prey are usually or seasonally sparse. Often in response to confirmed or assumed livestock depredation, Spotted Hyenas are shot, snared, speared, or poisoned in many parts of their range by ranchers and pastoralists. Spotted Hyenas are also commonly killed on motor-ways. Habitat fragmentation and reduction are also having significant negative effects on the size of many Spotted Hyena populations. Finally, one of the most important threats to the conservation of Spotted Hyenas is their negative public image. Many people apparently believe these animals are not worth conserving. Educating the public about these complex and fascinating animals is expected to have a substantial positive effect on conservation efforts.",Bearder (1977) | Bearder & Randall (1978) | Binder & Van Valkenburgh (2000) | Binford et al.

They are most common where rainfall is 100-600 mm. They do not occur in forests or pure desert and are independent of drinking water. The northern subspecies occurs in grasslands and tree savannas of the Somali-Masai Arid Zone and the southern subspecies in the Southern Savanna and South-west Arid Zone.","Aardwolves are solitary foragers and feed almost exclusively on Trinervitermes termites, usually on one species in each particular region: 1. bettionianus in East Africa, 1. rhodesiensis in Zimbabwe and Botswana and 71. trinervoides in South Africa . These termites are largely avoided by other termite-eating mammals due to the noxious terpenoid chemicals secreted by the soldier termites, to which the Aardwolfis uniquely tolerant. In addition to the lack of competition, Aardwolf preference for this termite genus is likely due to the fact that these termites regularly congregate at night in large aboveground foraging parties. The termites are licked directly from the soil surface, and are easily obtainable in large quantities. Also, unlike true harvester termites, Trinervitermes forage throughout the year, making them a dependable year-round food source. Due to the small size of Trinervitermes and the wide dispersion of colonies, female Aardwolves must forage for at least six hours a night, during which up to 300,000 termites/night (1-2 kg) are consumed. Foraging Aardwolves travel approximately 1 km /h, with their ears cocked forward and head bentslightly down, following an erratic zig-zag route. Because they often approach termite colonies from downwind, and approach with directed movement before termites could be seen,it appears that termite foraging parties are detected at least partially by smell. However, the hearing of the Aardwolf is particularly acute and is assumed to play a role in colony detection. The average time spent foraging at individual termite patches was 20-28 seconds in East Africa, but in drier Namibian grassland, Aardwolves spent an average of 1-8 and 9-2 minutes at each patch in consecutive years of observation. In South Africa , a newly weaned four-month old cub spent an average of only eleven seconds at each patch, and juveniles frequently are seen vomiting after feeding on Trinervitermes, indicating that tolerance to the chemical secretions of Trinervitermes soldiers increases with age. Even adult Aardwolves maintain some aversion to the terpene chemicals, because they will avoid feeding on mounds under repair, where typically only dense concentrations of soldiers are found at the surface. Other surface-foraging termites, particularly Hodotermes and Microhodotermes ( South Africa ), Odontotermes and Macrotermes species (East Africa), make up a larger proportion of the diet when Trinervitermes are seasonally uncommon or unavailable, as during winter (May-August) in South Africa , and during the rainy season in East Africa. However, these species forage aboveground in much smaller parties (10-20 individuals vs. 4000 in Trinervitermes) and the reduced winter availability of Trinervitermes in South Africa results in a significant seasonal reduction in Aardwolf body weight and field metabolic rate. Aardwolves here were found to consume only one-sixth the number of termites in winter that they did in summer. Winter is also the highest period of mortality in Aardwolf cubs, which are 7-10 months old at this time, further indicating that this is a period ofsignificant energetic stress. Other termites found in fecal samples have included Odontotermes, Macrotermes, and Lepidotermes that are not surface-foraging species and therefore not important components of the Aardwolf diet. Occasional additional food items include ants and Coleopterans, yet the Aardwolf appears to be surprisingly inefficient at foraging on non-termite insects. Due to the high degree of specialization of its tongue for licking small arthropods, and the almost complete degeneration ofits cheek teeth, it is thought that they are unable to handle larger food items, making the species highly dependent on Trinervitermes. This dependence is supported by the absence of Aardwolves from Zambia and central and western Africa, where surface foraging Trinervitermes are either uncommon or available only a small part of the year. Aardwolves defecate in middens (also called latrines). The first defecation occurs when they exit the burrow in the evening and is typically very large, weighing up to 1 kg . Defecations are typically covered with soil. This practice of concentrating and burying their faeces, which retains some of the terpene smell of the soldier termites, has been suggested as a way of reducing the probability that an Aardwolf will mistake its own faeces for a termite colony when it is foraging. Up to 20 middens may be located in a territory.","Monogamous, yet during the mating season extra-pair copulations can be common (40% in South Africa ). Strictly seasonal breeding in the Northern Cape where most mating occurs during the first two weeks ofJuly. Females give birth every year in early October to 1-4 cubs (average of 2-5), after a 90day gestation period. In more northern parts of the range, breeding seasons appear to be less restricted. Estrus lasts 1-3 days but females may cycle again within two weeks if fertilization does not occur. Copulation lasts from 1-4-5 hours during which multiple ejaculations occur. Copulations may be interrupted by extra-pair males and in some cases females copulate with these new males. Cubs are born in a den and rarely emerge above ground during the first month. By three months, cubs have begun making short excursions from the den, usually accompanied by an adult. Weaning occurs around four months, and by this time cubs begin foraging alone within the territory. After weaning, cubs spend little time with their parents, are independent by about seven months, and are excluded from the territory soon after, usually by one year of age. Cubs grow quickly, reaching adult body mass by 3:6 months. Thisis likely an adaptation to maximize survival of cubs through their first winter, when cub mortality is highest. Sexual maturity is reached by 1-8 years. Each resident breeding male guards the female’s cubs during the period of den dependence. This is energetically costly asit typically leaves the males only 2-3 hours of foraging time before sunrise, compared to at least six hours for females. Due to the frequency of extrapair copulations, cuckoldry appears to be an established aspect of the mating system (“overt cuckoldry”), and males are likely to frequently help raise litters of mixed paternity or sired entirely by other males. Currently this appears to be unique among mammals.","Predominantly nocturnal, in South Africa Aardwolves are generally active for 8-9 hours a day in summer but only 3-4 hours a day in winter. In summer, they generally leave the den within an hour after sunset and return 1-4 hours before sunrise. However, during winter, some diurnal activity may be observed. Aardwolves typically become active up to an hour before sunset and return to their dens after 3—4 hours of foraging. A higher proportion of their time is spent feeding in winter than in summer, and a relatively large portion of the activity of both males and females in winter (12:6%) consists of breeding activities (e.g. courtship/copulation). Inactive hours during the day are spent in underground dens, which provide refuge from temperature extremes and predators, particularly Black-backed Jackals. Dens also function importantly in cub-rearing. Nighttime rest periods are also often spent near or inside dens. A territory may include up to ten different den holes, which are typically spring hare burrows that have been enlarged by Aardwolves.",,"Listed as a species of Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. Due to their shy and nocturnal nature, Aardwolves are probably more common than usually believed. That notwithstanding, Aardwolves in southern Africa generally occur outside of protected areas, and the primary threat in these locationsis indirect poisoning aimed at locust outbreaks. Poisoning events can result in the death of up to half the local adult population and all the cubs. Within protected areas, the most important mortality sources are severe drought and predation on cubs by Black-backed Jackals. Human-caused mortality also occurs as a result of direct persecution from farmers suspecting Aardwolf involvement in lamb predation, harvesting of Aardwolves as a food source, and indirect persecution during organized hunting for jackals. Aardwolves may also be killed by vehicles during the night. However, all these other mortality sources appear insignificant relative to poisoning, jackal predation and drought. Across its range, habitat fragmentation and isolation may be the most serious threat to long-term population viability; however,its dependence on habitat preferred for use in livestock grazing makes extensive habitat loss improbable.",Anderson | M.D. & Richardson (2005) | Anderson | M.D. et al.

Records from the SW of Angola are all before 1970.",,"Brown Hyenas are found in a variety of relatively arid habitats from open desert or semi-desert in the Namib and Kalahari, to dry open scrub and woodland savannah, mopani scrub and tree savannah, as well as the bushveld of the northern Transvaal. They do not need drinking water and inhabit areas where annual rainfall may be even lower than 100 mm , up to about 650 mm .","These hyenas forage alone at night and do not cooperate in hunting or in feeding, although group members tolerate each other at large food items. Although not competent hunters, Brown Hyenas are extremely efficient scavengers with an omnivorous diet. They are opportunistic feeders on a range of vertebrates, primarily mammals, the vast majority of which are scavenged, often from the kills of other carnivores. Fruits, insects and reptiles can be important supplementary foods when carcasses are rare. In one population 58 different food items were identified from fecal analysis. Brown Hyenas in the southern Kalahari spent 30% of their feeding time eating carrion, 28% on vegetable matter, 4-5% on small mammals, 1-5% on birds’ eggs, and 29% on unknown items. Only 5-8% of food they were seen eating was killed by the hyenas themselves. In the central Kalahari 35-9% ofall observed feeding bouts were on fresh scavenged kills, 33-9% on old carcasses, 16% on their own kills, and 12:5% on vegetative food sources. Brown Hyenas do not depend on standing water. In the central Kalahari, no free water orrain is typically found for eight months of the year. Although they will drink on a daily basis when water is present, much of the water during dry seasons is obtained from Cucurbitaceae fruits such as the tsama melon, gemsbok cucumber, and Hookeri melon, which can compose significant proportions of the diet in these seasons. Brown Hyenas inhabiting the Namibian coast feed almost exclusively on subadult Brown Fur Seals. The majority of these seals are thought to be scavenged, although Brown Hyenas have been seen hunting seal pups. In fact, hunting efficiency on seal pups during the peak pupping season can be as high as 47%, and an average of almost five seals per day may be killed from a single colony. Small rodents and seabirds make up the rest of this unique diet. Elsewhere hunting attempts by Brown Hyenas are opportunistic and directed at small mammals such as Springbok lambs, spring hares, Bat-eared Foxes, and ground nesting birds. The hunting technique of the Brown Hyena is unspecialized, rarely successful (except in the case of Brown Fur Seal pups), and may include a brief lunge at a surprised prey, a prolonged chase of up 1 km , or an attempt to dig up a burrowed animal. The percent of observed hunting attempts that were successful was 4:7% in the southern Kalahari and 13-7% in the central Kalahari. The hyenas generally feed where they find food, but food from larger carcasses is frequently cached nearby in a clump of grass or under a bush. Considerable time is often spent at carcasses removing limbs for this purpose and one animal may remove and cache up to three legs before any competitors arrive. Sites where food is cached are scent-marked and may be re-visited over multiple days. In a remarkable example of food caching in the southern Kalahari, a Brown Hyena arrived at an abandoned ostrich (Struthio camelus) nest with 26 eggs , which are prized food items. The hyena spent four hours carrying 14 eggs distances of 150-600 m from the nest, some of which it simply dropped in the open. It ate only three eggs during this period. Brown Hyenas also carry food back to cubs at the den. This provisioning of cubs can result in significant bone accumulations at densites. In the southern Kalahari the average distance moved between significant meals was 7-2 km, and the average nightly distance traveled was 31-1 km. During the dry season, nightly movements were longer and were recorded as high as 54-4 km. During the wet season movements were reduced and ranged from 10-20 km. In Namibia , daily distances traveled ranged from 15-47 km. When foraging, Brown Hyenas move at a pace of about 4 km /h, often walking in a zig-zag pattern, probably to maximize their chance of coming across food items. They use smell to locate much of their food, as evidenced by frequent sniffing and moving upwind toward food sources. Their hearing appears to be acute as well and is likely also used in foraging. The Brown Hyena is subordinate at kills to Spotted Hyenas, Lions and African Wild Dogs, although it appears to dominate Leopards in most situations. While they always dominate Cheetahs, they compete heavily with the much smaller Black-backed Jackal, which is often able to steal scraps from hyenas at carcasses. There is some evidence that, where they are sympatric, Brown Hyenas avoid areas frequented by Spotted Hyenas, potentially to avoid direct aggression and competition. For example, dens in the southern Kalahari were rarely found in the prey-rich riverine habitat where most Spotted Hyena dens occurred. Although their presence at livestock carcasses has resulted in much antagonism toward, and persecution of, Brown Hyenas by livestock owners, predation on livestock by these animals appears to be done by a small number of individuals. However, these hyenas, which typically target cow calves and sheep, can account for a large number of kills. Removal of these problem individuals appears effective at halting stock losses.","Brown Hyenas are polyestrous, non-seasonal breeders. Litters range from 1-4 cubs with a modallitter size of three. Estrus lasts approximately one week but mating in captivity occurs over a 15day period. Based on six observed mating bouts in the southern Kalahari, mating associations consist of multiple copulation attempts over a 5-90 minute period, and may be preceded by extended courtship, during which both animals may show aggression and there are mutual approaches and retreats. Gestation in captivity was 96 days. Interbirth intervals appear to range widely. In the southern Kalahari they were as short as a year and as long as 41 months apart, although lost litters in the interim could not be ruled out. Cubs are born with their eyes closed and their ears bent forward. Their fur is similar in color to that of adults. Their eyes begin to open at eight days and are completely open at 14 days. Unlike Spotted Hyenas, Brown Hyena cubs are born without teeth. As in the other bone-cracking hyaenids, den dependenceis long and weaning occurs late. Cubs from 0-3 months of age rarely leave the den hole except when their mother or another adult is present. During this period, mothers attend the den frequently, often at sunrise and sunset and cubs rely completely on their mother’s milk. At four months, visits by the mother become less frequent, with mothers visiting about once a night, but suckling periods are longer. At this time, mothers and other group members begin bringing food to the den for the cubs. Weaning normally occurs at 12-16 months of age, yet weaning conflicts have been observed at ten months. Starting at ten months, cubs begin extensive, and very often solitary, foraging movements away from the den. Length of den residence is variable however, ranging from 8-15 months. Regardless of their dependence on the den, by 16 months weaning has occurred and full adult dentition is present. As they mature, subadults themselves begin to bring food back to the den for younger cubs. This has been observed in subadults as young as 22 months. Adult size is reached at 30 months. The earliest breeding recorded in the wild is 35 months; breeding continues until at least ten years of age. Cubs are raised in underground, sometimes extensive, tunnels, always small enough to prevent adults and potential predators from entering. They are easily distinguished by accumulations of bones, hair, feathers, horns, pieces of hide, and hyena feces. In the southern Kalahari Brown Hyena dens appear to be used only rarely by multiple females at once, and cubs are typically raised in the same den in which they are born. However, communal denning appears to be common in the central Kalahari, with cubs of multiple females, and of different ages, raised together at a single den location. In this system, cubs are born in a solitary den and transported to the communal den sometime before they are four months of age. Throughout their development, den moves are common and cubs may reside at as many as seven different dens, though distances between dens are typically not large. In the central Kalahari, where a social rank system is evident, dominant females enjoy greater reproductive success in terms of number of surviving offspring, yet the number oflitters does not vary based on rank. There appears to be variation, both regionally and temporally, in the mating system of Brown Hyenas. In one system, females breed only with nomadic males that range over wide areas without defended territories or family groups. In the other, females breed not only with nomadic males but with resident immigrant males as well. These residents are members of the clan and assist in territory defense, yet their tenure, at least in the central Kalahari, is relatively short (less than three years). In this area, where both nomadic males and resident immigrant males are present, dominant clan males were observed to copulate with resident females more frequently than nomadic males. In the southern Kalahari, the only mating observed involved nomadic males, and no resident males, either immigrant or natal, were observed to mate. Although males known to be natal showed little sexual interest at all in any resident females, researchers were unable to observe immigrant males long enough to ascertain sexual interest in resident females. The source of the variation in the mating system of Brown Hyenas is unclear, although it may be related to dispersion of food. In the central Kalahari, where both systems were observed over time, mating with nomadic males was restricted to the dry season, when resident clan males would likely have difficulty maintaining contact with clan females (some were separated by 22 km ). Because territories are very large in the southern Kalahari and only breeding with nomadic malesis seen, the food dispersion theory is further supported. Individual reproductive patterns in males are also likely to be influenced by individual status and the behavior of other males in the population. In either case, natal males are never observed to mate with females in their natal clan. Communal care of cubs is better developed among Brown Hyenas than in any of the other three hyaenid species. Non-parental aid in cub rearing includes communal suckling (although preference in nursing one’s own cubs has been shown), food provisioning, den maintenance, defense against predators, play, and adoption of orphans. Subadult and adult females ofall social ranks and reproductive states bring food items to the den for cubs. However, the extent of involvement in provisioning by adult males seems to vary by region. In the central Kalahari, subadult males provision cubs, but to a lesser degree than females, and they only bring food to closely related cubs. Neither immigrant nor natal adult males were seen provisioning cubs. It has been suggested thatthis is because males do not benefit from an increased group size, as they are likely to emigrate from their natal clan. In the southern Kalahari, however, group-living males and females, both adult and subadult, were observed to provision cubs regularly. Average distance in this population from which food was carried back to the den was 6-4 km.","Primarily a nocturnal animal, although activity is occasionally observed during the day, particularly on cool, cloudy days during the rainy season. There are typcally two peaks of activity, from 19:30 h to 24:00 h and 2:30 h to 6:00 h, with a rest period in between. Radio-collared adults in the southern Kalahari were active for 42.6% of the 24 h period, and 80.2% of the period between 18:00 h and 06:00 h. In Namibia , three males with satellite collars spent an average of 57-1-72-3% of 24 h active. Brown Hyenas typically rest during the day in a hole, or undera large tree or bush.",,"Listed as Near Threatened on The IUCN Red List. In 1994 the species was down-listed from Appendix I status, which was afforded the species in 1975, to Appendix II by the IUCN and it has since been deleted from CITES listing altogether. [tis generally considered to be widespread yet rare. The total population is estimated to be 5000 to 8000, but this may be an underestimate due to the secretive nature and nocturnal habits of this animal. It is estimated that areas in excess of 1000 km ?” are required to maintain a viable population of Brown Hyenas. These populations currently exist in the Kalahari Gemsbok National Park, South Africa and the adjacent Gemsbok National Park, Botswana , the Central Kalahari Game Reserve, Botswana , and the coastal regions of the southern Namib Desert. These are also the sites of the primary research projects that provide much of what we know about this species in the wild. Much of the habitat where Brown Hyenas occur outside protected areas is used for livestock ranching, and the hyenas are heavily persecuted (shot, poisoned, trapped, and hunted with dogs) in these areas because they are assumed to be livestock predators. This persecution, and habitat loss and fragmentation, are the primary threats to persistence of Brown Hyena. Because they are scavengers, many livestock carcasses where they are seen feeding are likely not to have been killed by Brown Hyenas. Although the species can be involved in depredation,this is usually restricted to a few individuals. Regardless, management of Brown Hyenas on ranchlands must address livestock losses. Typically, removal of individual problem hyenas ends the depredation. Because there is evidence that Brown Hyenas may be limited by the presence of Spotted Hyenas and perhaps other large predators, which are often absent from ranches, these ranchlands have the potential to be developed as Brown Hyena conservation areas, given proper management and conservation education efforts. Brown Hyenas are uncommon in captivity and traditionally do not breed well in confinement. Due to difficulties in captive breeding, the international studbook was discontinued in 1993 and as of 1995 there were only 16 specimens in nine collections. There is no known illegal trade in the species.",Eaton (1976) | Gorman & Mills (1984) | Maddock (1993) | Mills (1982a | 1982b | 1982¢c | 1983a | 1983b | 1984a | 1990) | Mills & Hofer (1998) | Mills & Mills (1978 | 1982) | Mills et al.

Although they do not occur in the central Sahara, these animals occur at low density in patches throughout eastern, western and northern Africa, including Algeria , Benin , Burkina Faso , Cameroon , Chad , Djibouti , Egypt , Ethiopia , Ghana , Kenya , Libya , Mali , Nigeria , Mauritania , Morocco , Niger , Senegal , Tanzania , and Tunisia . Striped Hyenas also occur in the Middle East and Central Asia. Middle Eastern and Asian countries included in the modern distribution of the Striped Hyena are Afghanistan , Armenia , Azerbaijan , Georgia , India , Iran , Iraq , Israel , Jordan , Lebanon , Nepal , Oman , Pakistan , Saudi Arabia , Tajikistan , Turkey , Turkmenistan , Uzbekistan , and Yemen . The current distribution of this species is patchy, and usually appears to occur in small, isolated populations.",,"In most ofits range the Striped Hyena occurs in rugged, arid habitat or light thorn bush country. These animals drink regularly where wateris available, but they can also survive in many waterless areas. In North Africa they prefer open woodlands and bushy and mountainous regions. The central Arabian and Sahara Deserts are not suitable habitat. In central Asia, Striped Hyenas avoid high altitudes and dense thickets and forests. The maximum elevations recorded are 2250 m in Iran , 2500 m in India and 3300 m in Pakistan . In the Caucasus region, Turkmenistan , Tadzhikistan , and Uzbekistan , prime habitats include savannah and semi-desert regions up to an elevation of 2100 m , mountain areas with strong relief, valleys with abundant caves or other resting sites, and riverine areas. The Striped Hyena avoids areas with minimum temperatures ofless than —15°C to —20°C and more than 80-120 days offrost per year. In Israel , Striped Hyenas are present even close to dense human settlements. In West Africa, they occur in dry scrub savanna and Sahel woodland, particularly in the belt of Acacia raddiana woodland that extends from Senegal to Chad . In eastern Africa, Striped Hyenas are found in a variety of habitats ranging from open savanna to rugged, bush-covered mountain terrain.","The diet of Striped Hyenas apparently varies considerably from one part of their range to another, but these animals are clearly scavengers with catholic tastes. They are primarily carrion-eaters; their diet consists mainly of dried flesh and bones from carcasses of large vertebrates. They scavenge carrion and the remains of kills made by other predators, including Spotted Hyenas, Cheetahs, Leopards, Lions, and Tigers. The Hyena’s massive cheek teeth and supporting musculature easily permit the gnawing and breaking of bones, as well as the carapaces of tortoises and turtles. Striped Hyenas have also been reported to consume a wide variety of invertebrates, vegetables, fruit, garbage, and small vertebrates that the Hyenas hunt themselves. In central Kenya , analysis of bone fragments and hairs from fecal samples indicated that hyenas regularly consume small mammals and birds that are unlikely to be scavenged. The limited available diet data may underestimate the importance of active hunting in the lives of these animals. In various parts of eastern Africa, Striped Hyenas are reported to supplement their diet with Balanites fruits. The proportion of scavenged and killed prey items in the diet is still a matter of debate as there has been no detailed research on these Hyenas’ food intake. Some authors suggest that only individuals from the three larger subspecies, barbara, syriaca and hyaena , kill large prey, including livestock,as there is no evidence that the smaller subspecies, dubbah and sultana, attack large herbivores. In Turkmenistan the Striped Hyena has been reported feeding on Wild Boar, Kulan, porcupine, and particularly tortoises. In Uzbekhistan and Tadzhikistan , seasonal abundance of oil willow fruits (Eleagnus angustifolia) is reflected in the diet; in the Caucasus region the diet includes abundant grasshoppers. In Israel the Striped Hyena feeds on garbage, carrion, and fruits, particularly dates and melons. In eastern Jordan , the main sources of food are carcasses of feral horses and water buffalo and refuse from localvillages. The Striped Hyena can drink water of very variable quality, from fresh water to soda and salt water, but it may also satisfy its water requirements with melons or otherfruits. Very little is currently known about the hunting behavior of Striped Hyenas, but those few hunts that have been observed involved simple chases and grabs at prey. Seasonal influxes of Striped Hyenas follow migrations of large herds of domestic and wild ungulates in Turkmenistan , suggesting that the Hyenas cover long distances on foraging trips. In Egypt they are known to move along ancient caravan roads where the chance of locating dead camels is high. In Serengeti and in southern Kenya , they spend most of the night actively searching for food or moving between established foraging sites. Striped Hyenas apparently can remember the locations offruiting trees, garbage dumps and other established feeding sites, although the routes taken to re-visit such food sources are seldom repeated on consecutive foraging trips. They are also able to locate tortoises in their hiding places during periods of aestivation and hibernation. Striped Hyenas frequently cache bones or pieces of skin, using their snouts to push these items deep into clumps of grass or stands of dense shrubs. They may also carry food items back to their dens. Bone collections are common at den sites used by Striped Hyenas, although it is often unclear whether these collections represent scavenged or killed prey, and whether the bones collected play a significant nutritional role in the lives of these animals. Several studies have inferred diet by combining data from bone collections and fecal samples. In central Kenya , however, bone collections indicated a much broader range of prey than did scat analysis, and significant portions of bone assemblages were very old bones unlikely to represent material scavenged from fresh kills. From fecal analysis alone, several researchers have found remains of prey items that are more likely to have been scavenged than hunted, and larger mammals are represented far less often in the analysis of hairs in fecal material than would be expected based only on bone collections at dens. Striped Hyenas appear to be strictly solitary foragers, although multiple individuals occasionally gather at rich food sources such as large carcasses or refuse pits. These animals are sometimes found in small groups while resting, but there is no indication that they ever forage cooperatively. Genetic relatedness among members of groups seen feeding together has not been investigated. Foraging activity in Kenya and Tanzania is restricted to hours of darkness except during rain or unusually cloudy weather. Under those circumstances, Striped Hyenas may return to previously visited kills or carcasses, but do not embark on full foraging forays. In many areas, and for many centuries, Striped Hyenas have been described as raiding human graves and carrying away bones. Fruit and vegetable crop raiding by Striped Hyenas is currently considered a serious problem in some parts of Israel . While foraging, Striped Hyenas zigzag across the landscape and do not appear to follow set routes, even when returning to the same food source on multiple nights. Minimum mean distance travelled per night is 19 km at speeds of 2-4 km/h, occasionally trotting at speeds of up to 8 km /h, or running at a maximum of 50 km /h. Overall, the evidence indicates that Striped Hyenas are solitary foragers for which carrion, insects, fruits and vegetable matter represent significant portions of the diet.","Females are polyestrous and breed throughout the year. Estrus is reported to last one day. No detailed descriptions of sexual behavior in the wild have been reported, but during matings in captivity, females may mate several times at intervals of at least 15 minutes. In the wild, litter size varies from one to four (median of three), after a gestation period of 90-91 days. Average litter size in captivity is 2-4, with a range of one to five. Parturition is preceded by intensive digging behavior by the female. Cubs weigh approximately 700 g at birth; they have adult-like markings but lack manes, and instead have only black spinal stripes. They are born with eyes and ears closed, and they are barely able to crawl, so they are far more altricial than Spotted Hyena cubs at birth. Their eyesfirst open after five to nine days, and cubs may emerge from the den at around two weeks of age. Deciduous teeth start to erupt on day 21. Cubs begin to eat meat at the age of 30 days. In the wild cubs are known to nurse for over one year. They reach reproductive maturity during the second year oflife. The mating system is promiscuous or polyandrous. In the Laikipia population in Kenya , females appear to mate with both group males and males that reside elsewhere. It is not known whether sires contribute in any way to parental care in this population, but lactating females are usually found alone at dens with their cubs, males do not spend significant periods of time at dens, and females appear to be solely responsible for care of young. Multiple paternity in this population occurred in half of sampled litters, and extra-group males sired roughly one third of the cubs born to group females. Striped Hyenas usually use caves, ravines or other sheltered rocky places as dens, although earthen dens may also be used. Den entrances are fairly narrow and may be hidden by large boulders. Two dens were measured in the Karakum Desert. The entrances were 0-67 m and 0-72 m wide. The dens sloped downward 3 m and 2bm and were 4-15 m and 5 m long, with no lateral extensions or special chambers. These simple constructions contrast with much more elaborate dens found in Israel , which can exceed 27 m in length.","The Striped Hyena is almost strictly nocturnal, although it does occasionally engage in some activity after dawn and before dusk. Some authorities suggest Striped Hyenas may be moststrictly nocturnal in areas characterized by relatively intensive anthropogenic activity, and where they are directly persecuted by humans.",,"Listed as Near Threatened on The IUCN Red List. Despite their broad distribution, the basic biology of Striped Hyenas, including their abundance in most parts of their range, remains very poorly known. Throughout its range, the Striped Hyena occurs at low densities. There have been only two local estimates of Striped Hyena density in Africa, and it is considered either threatened or data deficient throughout its African range. In Serengeti and Laikipia, density was estimated to be 0-02 per km? and 0-03 adults per km?, respectively. Remarkably little information is available on the species. This is undoubtedly due to its shy, nocturnal, mostly solitary nature, its apparent affinity for rugged terrain, its generally negative reputation, and frequent confusion with, or lack of differentiation from, Spotted Hyenas where the two species overlap. Most adult mortality is directly caused by Lions and humans. Striped Hyenas, particularly those inhabiting areas where natural prey are usually or seasonally sparse, may attack livestock, and as a result they are shot, snared, speared, or poisoned in many parts of their range by ranchers and pastoralists. It appears that the Striped Hyena is already extinct in many localities, and that populations are generally declining. The major reasonsfor this decline appear to be decreasing natural and domestic sources of carrion due to declines in the populations of other large carnivores and their prey, and changes in livestock practices. Moreover, the low densities and associated large home ranges of these animals are likely to increase the chances that populations will become fragmented into small, non-viable units. This must be considered a key problem if these animals are to be protected. The Striped Hyena evokes many superstitious fears because of putative and documented cases of grave-robbing and attacks on humans. In addition,its body parts are widely exploited as aphrodisiacs, and are utilized in folk medicine. Striped Hyenas are often killed because of suspected or real damage inflicted on agricultural produce and livestock, and they are often shot by livestock ranchers. These animals have also been widely hunted through poisoning, baiting traps, pits, or with the help of dogs. The Striped Hyena does sometimes cause damage to crops, and may sometimes also attack domestic animals, predominantly goats, sheep, dogs, and poultry. In many cases of damage to livestock, it is unclear whether the targeted individual was adult or young, healthy or sick, so Striped Hyenas may be blamed for livestock mortality for which they are not truly responsible. In any case, the records suggest that attacks on livestock by Striped Hyenas usually occur at very low frequencies. Tentative estimates of the total worldwide population size range from 5000 to 14,000 individuals. Fragmentation into many subpopulations is suspected even though the actual degree of fragmentation is unknown. In addition, habitat loss and declining population size are occurring at unknown rates. The Striped Hyena is considered threatened in all parts of its African range where data are sufficient to evaluate the local status, except in Ethiopia and Kenya , whereit is considered at lowerrisk. As we currently know so little about the biology ofthis species, one of the most pressing conservation concerns is to study these animals in a number of different locales. In addition to knowing very little about their behavioral ecology, we also know virtually nothing about their abundance and population dynamics. Before we can make management decisions in the best interest of Striped Hyenas, we need more information. Fortunately, studies of these animals are currently underway in East Africa, India , and the Middle East.",Bouskila (1984) | Davidar (1990) | Hofer (1998) | Horwitz & Smith (1988) | Kerbis-Peterhans & Horwitz (1992) | Koepfli et al.

In general these high-altitude grazing lands are low producing with annual production at 200-600 kg/ha for plains and mountainous zones and 600-2450 kg/ha for bofedales. The bofedal habitat is especially important for foraging Llamas during the dry season, yet fragile and susceptible to erosion if overgrazing is permitted.","[lamas are considered by their indigenous herders to be extremely hardy because of their ability to prosper in desolate-Andean environments. They have similar feeding habits to Alpacas, but distinct enough to make joint husbandry compatible and possible. Herders view the land andits forage as a single valuable unit because it feeds their Llamas and Alpacas. Land ownership is not important, but traditional use and designated rights to graze particular areas is critical. Studies in the highlands of Peru and Chile on the botanical composition of the diets of Llamas feeding on wet (bofedales) and dry (gramadales) meadows found a high overlap with Alpaca and sheep feeding habits, but significantly differed from Alpacas in the summer (61%) and winter (74%) because the two camelids were managed by herders to minimize competition. Llamas had higher digestion coefficients than sheep of organic matter, crude protein, dry matter, and fiber fractions of bunchgrasses, important forage for Llamas. These feeding trials comparing the abilities of Llamas vs domestic sheep in digesting organic material ofvarious qualities revealed the coefficients of digestibility for low quality to be 51 vs. 41 (24% difference between the species), medium quality 60 vs. 52 (15%), high quality 73 vs. 75 (-=3%), high fiber 58 vs. 52 (12%), medium fiber 62 vs. 58 (7%), and low fiber 67 vs. 65 (3%). Thus Llamas were significantly more efficient than sheep when forage was low to medium quality and high in fiber. Maintenance energy requirements for a 108 kg Llama is 2% of its body weight, or 2-2 kg dry matter of forage per day.","The breeding season is from February to May. Males used for breeding are commonly familiar to the females, who when approached sit down in the copulatory position. Unfamiliar males usually have to chase the female and force her to recline. Research and extension agencies encourage herders to use one male with five females for three days, and then remove the male. The male is reintroduced 15 days later and the cycle is repeated until all females are bred. Gestation is 340-360 days. A single offspring is born, although exceptionally twins do occur. The female gives birth standing up, there is no licking of the neonate, and newborns can follow their mother within an hour. Llamas have a high potential for reproduction under good management: 85-95% annual reproductive rate on research and well-managed farms. However, in the Andes due to poor forage conditions frequently available to indigenous herders and the resulting poor condition of animals,fertility has been reported to be as low as 45-55%. In years of severe cold or droughts subadult mortality can be as high as 30-50%. Offspring regularly nurse up to the fifth month and are weaned by the herder at eight months, although if allowed to do so will continue to nurse irregularly until the female gives birth again the following year. Some females breed 8-10 days after parturition, but two to three weeks later is the norm. Mother Llamas are patient with suckling their young and some will accept nursing another female’s offspring. After weaning the young Llamas, some herders separate them from females until two years old, and then segregate them by sex. At three years of age a final selection is made for the best males to be sires with the balance to be used as pack animals or eventually meat. Females are bred at two and half years and not used as beasts of burden.","Daily activity patterns of Llamas are essentially the same as Alpacas. That is, after having spent the night in or next to a rudimentary stone corral adjacent to the family’s residence (often a single-room hut called “choza” made of stones with a thatched roof), the Llamas move out soon after sunrise to feed in the local highaltitude grasslands, moving and grazing often unattended by a herder, then return to the choza as darkness approaches. Activity budgets (percentage of time) of Llamas compared to sheep grazing on native Andean pasture dominated by favorable forage ( Festuca dolichophylla), have shown that all other activities were similar, but that Llamas feed more (71% vs. 57%) and rested less (15% vs. 25%) than sheep.",,"Bolivia has most (58%) of South America’s ¢.3-91 million Llamas, followed by Peru (37%), Argentina (4%), and Chile (1%); nearly all of which (99%) are found in indigenous communities. The total number of Llamas has increased 12% during the past decade. In Bolivia 370,000-500,000 families raise Llamas, in Peru 297,414, Argentina 2803, 80% of which have fewer than 90 animals. There are no known wild or feral populations. Llamas were intertwined with the rise and spread of the Inca Empire since its beginning in the Peruvian Andes in the early 1200s. With the help of Llamas, the Incas built sturdy walls, buildings, irrigation systems, and some 8700 km of roads throughout their empire. These roads eventually extended around 2500 km from Ecuador south to central Chile and parts of Argentina . Before the Spanish Conquest of Peru , Llamas numbered into the multimillions, but were severely decimated during the post-conquest period. While early Spanish chroniclers recorded the “virtual disappearance” of these animals within a hundred years, that was obviously an exaggeration. Indigenous and endemic to the South America, [Llamas have now been exported to countries around the world as a companion animal, featured in livestock shows, used for trekking and backpacking, and increasingly utilized as a guard animal for protecting sheep and goats from canid predators. In the USA there were 162,000 registered Llamas in 2010. Export of Llamas (as well as Alpacas) has increased international interest in these species, stimulating research in the medical, nutritional, reproductive, and disease disciplines. In the Andes, Llamas are viewed and described by native herders by masculine terminology. During ceremonies in which Llamas are being honored or sacrificed, they are referred to as “brothers” and when higher rank or importance is expressed, they are called “fathers.” Indigenous Llama terminology is based upon fleece color, patterns and patches, sex, reproductive status, age, size, shape, wool quality, and behavior. The combinations of these descriptive characters amount to over 20,000 words, forming a rich nomenclature used to identify and distinguish individual Llamas as well as Alpacas. Llamas have long been important beasts of burden for the Andean cultures and nations. Cargo-carrying Llamas have made it possible for peoples of the Andes to successfully inhabit this rugged-mountain environment. Extensive and ritualized prayers are said before departure of a Llama caravan, requesting permission and protection from local deities for the journey, safe passage, and that no incident will befall the Llamas or family members while traveling. Only men of the family travel with the Llama pack train, walking behind the animals. Castrated male Llamas are used primarily, and depending upon their maturity, size, and training, individuals are capable of carrying up to 25-30% of their body weight, or 25-35 kg, and traveling 20-30 km in a day for up to 20 days. The cargo is carried in a sack tied to the Llama’s back with a rope made from coarse Llama wool. Males are castrated at two years of age and training begins by accompanying the older animals on trips. Individual Llamas in the traveling caravan are not tied together, but follow the lead of two to three “Llama guides.” Such lead Llamas traditionally were adorned with colorful halters, frontal tapestries, and even a family or national flag atop its back. Animal leaders are given names to reflect their status, such as Road-Breaker, Condor Face, and Champion. Lead Llamas prevent junior animals from usurping the front position, and guide the way when fording rivers, crossing dangerous bridges, and when negotiating narrow paths along steep ravines. If the lead Llama stops, the entire caravan waits until it resumes traveling. At the end of the day, Llamas are unpacked and turned loose to graze and water. If available, they are kept in stone corrals for the night, otherwise they are grouped together with a rope running around them at neck level. Llama caravans use traditional trading circuits in the Altiplano, some descending into the Andean valleys, the Pacific coast to the west, or the Amazon jungle to the east. Goods are sold, purchased, and traded along the route as needed. From the coastal agricultural valleys fresh produce was obtained in exchange for corn, potatoes, wheat, and barley that were grown and carried down from the mountain agricultural valleys. In times past Llama trains traveled hundreds of kilometers to obtain highly prized salt from inland, natural-salt deposits and mines, some types of which were used for human consumption, others for animals. Today, the world of the Andean Llama herdsmen is rapidly changing with goods and produce now primarily transported by trucks and rail. Still, Llama caravans continue to be used and are especially important for transporting goods to remote regions of the Andes. Secondarily Llamas are used in South America for meat, fuel, and wool. Llama meatis often dried and stored as jerky, typically made by alternative freeze-drying during the Andean winter when nights are freezing and days sunny. With a dressing percentage of 44-48% yielding 25-30 kg of fresh meat, 12-15 kg ofjerky are produced. Jerky is not only a convenient form for long-term storage of meat, but is an excellent source of protein (55-60%). Llama hides are used for making shoes, ropes, and bags. Their fecal matter is valuable as fuel in regions where wood is scarce. It should be noted that despite the presence of many animals, the diet of Andean herdsmen is based upon agricultural produce. They eat little meat and drink no milk. Goat or cow cheese is consumed by some, and when meat is eaten,it is in the form of cameloid jerky or fresh sheep meat. Outside South America the Llama’s cargo-carrying ability has been discovered by hikers, hunters, and forest-work crews in North America, Europe, Australia , and New Zealand . Llamas are quiet, gentle, unobtrusive, and easy to manage. Their hardiness, surefootedness, and trainability make them excellent pack animals and trail companions. The Llama’s agility allows them to negotiate terrain that would be difficult or impossible for other pack animals, and because of their padded feet and ability to browse, they have minimal impact on trails and mountain meadows. In North America Llamas have been used highly successfully as guard llamas for protecting sheep and goats from coyote and feral dog predation. Livestock owners report that their annual sheep losses dropped from 11% to 1% after the introduction of a guard llama, and more than half reported 100% reduction in predator losses. Single, gelded males are typically used, although females work equally well. In 2006, they were found across Canada as well as in every USstate. In the USA there were over 11,000 guard llamas in use on some 9500 sheep operations. Remarkably, half the sheep ranchers in Wyoming have guard llamas and they are common on sheep ranches in Colorado (39%), Montana (28%), and Utah (23%). In the Plains States, 23% of sheep producers in North Dakota and 21% in South Dakota use guard llamas. In the Midwest and the Eastern States, Missouri (23%) and North Carolina (24%) lead the way, respectively. Although not a panacea, guard llamas have proven to be a viable non-lethal alternative for reducing predation, requiring no special training and minimal care.",Bravo et al.

These combine to produce high evapo-transpiration and dry conditions that lead to low primary productivity. At a broad scale, Guanacos inhabit four of the ten major habitats found in South America: desert and xeric shrublands, montane and lowland grasslands, savannas and shrublands, and temperate forests, which botanically include the categories of Puna, pre-Puna, Andean steppe, Chacoan grasslands and shrublands, Espinal, and the southern Pampa. They inhabit flatlands, hilly foothills, and mountainous environments. In the arid habitats of southern Chile , isolated mesic subsystems were the preferred plant community accounting for 85% of female sightings and 60% ofterritorial males. These “vegas” (meadows) were not only preferred for their productive, higher-quality succulent forage, but for females a major influence for their selection was the avoidance ofsites and habitats favored by Pumas (Puma concolor).","The Guanaco is a non-specialized, opportunistic, intermediate, mixed-feeding herbivore, foraging on a wide variety of plants. It is basically a grazer, but also browses. When the availability of the herbaceous strata decreases or becomes unavailable, especially during winter, Guanacos feed mainly on the shrub or tree strata. This flexibility as a generalist to change diet according to availability or preference extends to eating epiphytes, lichens, fungi, cacti, succulent plants, fruit, flowers, and leaves. Their summer diet in a mixed habitat of southern Chile averaged 62% grasses (mainly Festuca ), 15% browse (Nothofagusspp.), and 11% forbs, which were particularly important in the spring. In another study on Tierra del Fuego their diet was made up of 90% grasses and forbs. In austral coastal forests of southern Chile , Guanaco browsing significantly diminishes the rate of regeneration of the commercially important southern beech tree (Nothofagus pumilio) and was a limiting factor on initial growth of seedlings and saplings (89% were browsed), although the Guanaco’s diet was less than 10% shrubs and trees. At Torres del Paine National Park, at the western edge of the Patagonia, vegas were highly utilized in summer (86% ofall feeding observations) and preferred by all feeding Guanacos (n = 1659) in family groups, whereas all other vegetation types were avoided (shrub = 3%, upland = 10%). Adult females in family groups showed the greatest feeding preference for vegas, followed by chulengos, yearlings, and adult males. In Argentine Patagonia, Guanaco densities are low and negatively related to domestic sheep numbers. Guanacos and sheep largely overlap in their forage preferences, with over 80% oftheir diets being identical. Histological analysis of fecal samples revealed that Guanacos and sheep were intermediate herbivores feeding on a wide range of grasses and forbs, capable of changing their diets seasonally, and their food niches greatly overlapped particularly in summer when food resources were more scarce than in spring.","Nearly all females breed at two years of age and have their first offspring as three-year olds. At Torres del Paine, Chile males began breeding after obtaining a feeding territory when they were 2—4 years of age. Essentially all breeding took place within feeding territories during the summer. A high percentage (88%) of males established a territory for three or fewer years (average 2-3), although some males held territories for as long as eight years. Few solo males became family group males (19%), that is, 81% remained non-reproductive during their territorial tenure. Those males leaving male groups to become territorial, only 35% directly became family group territorial males while 65% became solo territorial males. Like other camelids, Guanacos are induced ovulators. The territorial mating period was from early Decemberto early January (91% of 88 observed copulations), so males defended their feeding territories for nine weeks before and eight weeks after the mating season. Mature female Guanacos give birth to a single offspring each year after a gestation of about 11-7 months (345-360 days). Only three sets of twins were documented in over two decades offield studies at Torres del Paine during which several thousand newborns were observed; in all cases no more than one survived past the first week. Half of all births occur in the last two weeks of spring. The timing of parturition varies with latitude. At Torres del Paine the birth season occurred from late November to early January. Parturition occurs during the day in Patagonia with 78% of births between 10:00 h and 14:00 h, when the young are able to dry during favorable midday temperature conditions. Birth weight averages 13 kg (7-15 kg) and shows marked density dependence, with lower birth weights at higher population densities. Low weight at birth is related to high rates of mortality. Newborns are very precocious. They can stand as early as 5-76 minutes after birth and can run within hours. Young are weaned at 6-8 months and are expelled from family groups by the territorial male when they are 11-15 months old. Dispersing yearling males join male groups and yearling females join family groups or female groups. Monitoring of 409 radio-collared chulengos at Torres del Paine over a seven-year period revealed an average first-year survival rate of 38% (31-55%). Puma predation was the primary cause of mortality of young Guanacos, especially in the first two weeks of life. Relative to their availabilities, chulengos were preyed upon about four times as much as adults. With every centimeter increase in winter snowfall, the risk of chulengo mortality increased by almost 6% because of greater vulnerability to predation. Out of 731 Guanaco skulls collected at Torres del Paine from 1979 to 1988, 33% showed clear evidence of having been killed by Pumas, and that was considered an underestimate. Observations of farmed Guanacos revealed that allosuckling (nursing of non-filial offspring) comprised 6% of all suckling events by 62% of calves and was allowed by 52% of dams. Dams whose calves performed allosuckling exhibited poorer body condition, suggesting juvenile Guanacos allosuckled to compensate for nutritional deficiencies. Preliminary research on the cytochrome-b gene sequence has found no evidence of hybridization between Guanacos and Vicunas.","Observations of both wild and captive Guanacos have shown peaks of eating, bedding, and ruminating in the morning and again later in the afternoon. Wild Guanacos spent a greater proportion of their time moving and less time resting, probably the result of the need to forage more and maintain intraspecific social interactions. At Torres del Paine during the summer, Guanacos in family groups in vega habitat fed 54% of time, rested 45%, and were involved in other behaviors 1% of the time (3084 focal observations). There was no difference in the activity-time budgets of 23 marked solo territorial males compared to family-group territorial males based on social group type, total number of females, total number of Guanacos present, or age of the ter ritorial males. The pattern suggested thatterritorial male behaviors were related to resource defense rather than to any direct ability to attract potential mates. Males, in all categories, spent most of their time foraging (65% of overall time budget). However, based upon habitat type there was a significant difference in time spent in aggressive and in miscellaneous activities (defecation, alertness to observer, scratching). Most aggressive encounters and miscellaneous activity occurred on hilltops of areas dominated by mata barrosa shrubs (Mulinum spinosum). Vigilance patterns were assessed in Chubut , Argentina for Guanacos occupying a tall shrubland covering 40-60% of the area, where 40% of the mortality was from Puma predation. Family group territorial males devoted more time to scanning their surroundings and less time feeding than did females, and both sexes benefited from grouping by reducing the time invested in vigilance and increasing foraging time. Males reduced the time invested in vigilance as the number of females in the group increased, while the presence of chulengos increased territorial male vigilance. However, in closed habitats collective vigilance increased with the number of adults but decreased with the number of chulengos. Although male and female Guanacos differed in their time allocation, results supported the hypothesis that both sexes received significant anti-predator benefits from group living. Adjustments in Guanaco body posture can modify the exposure of body surface area H—22%. Guanacos can decrease and increase body heat loss through radiation and convection by “closing” and “opening” their thermal windows in the axillary and flank regions. Researchers report that when ambient temperatures were 0-10°C, animals used postural adjustments to decrease the area of the thermal windows by 5-7% oftotal surface area. At temperatures greater than 10°C they increased the area of the thermal windows up to 22% to regulate heat loss through radiation and convection. When the temperature was below 0—1°C Guanacos bedded and huddled together, often with their hindquarters into the wind.",,"CITES Appendix II. Classified as Least Concern on The [UCN Red List. Northern subspecies cacsilensis is recognized as Endangered on The 2006 IUCN Red List with about 4000 remaining.The Guanaco is the most widely distributed native artiodactyl in South America. It originally ranged from the Andean areas of northern Peru , south to Bolivia and adjacent parts of Paraguay and down to Tierra del Fuego , covering most of Argentina and Chile . Based upon the carrying capacity of the territory Guanacos originally occupied, the pre-Hispanic Guanaco population in southern South America has been estimated to be 30-50 million. Indiscriminate hunting and competition with sheep, particularly during the past century, caused a steep decline in numbers. In the Argentine Patagonia the introduced sheep reached 22 million head within 50 years in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Today, the best estimate of the total Guanaco population is 536,000-840,000 animals. Although still widely distributed, the Guanaco’s current distribution is less than 40% of its original range, with remaining populations often isolated and fragmented. The killing of young chulengos for their soft skins has had a serious impact on Guanaco populations, especially in Patagonia. Some 444,000 skins were exported from Argentina between 1972 and 1979. The number dropped to 10,000 annually by 1984, reflecting decreased availability. Conservation classification and laws regarding the remaining Guanaco populations vary from nation to nation, based primarily upon total numbers and without regard to subspecies. Percentage of total remaining numbers and conservation classification by countriesis as follows: Argentina 87% (considered not endangered or potentially vulnerable), Chile 12% (vulnerable and protected), Bolivia 0-03% (endangered and protection in development), Paraguay 0-02% (endangered and not protected), and Peru 0-62% (endangered and active management being pursued). Thus at the national level, relict Guanaco populations are faced with potential extinction in three out of the five countries where they were found historically. In Argentina management plans are beginning to include utilization of the Guanaco for meat and wool. Today, around 35% of the high density populations identified in Argentina are under programs that call for live-shearing Guanacos for sustained use of their valuable wool. Also in Argentina , the country with the most Guanacos, a National Management Plan has been prepared and endorsed by the provinces with the highest Guanaco densities. However, less than 1% of the area in the Patagonian steppe is estimated to be under effective protection. Guanacosstill have a wide distribution, an apparently stable population trend, and large populations in protected areas. However, it is not uncommon that protected areas are in name only because they contain competing livestock, there are no wardens or guards, and poaching is common. Conservation priorities for the Guanaco include all of the following: improved and accurate population surveys; adequate habitat protection; regulation of hunting quotas; where feasible, live-shearing; protection of remnant populations from poaching (especially in Peru and northern Chile ); more explicit goals and policies (for example in southern Argentina and Chile ); confronting Patagonian land use practices, which focus on maximizing sheep numbers; addressing the need for unified laws and management schemes between countries; and finally and especially, the implementation of conservation oriented management at local, national, and international levels.",Baldi | Lichtenstein et al.

The Puna ecosystem is rolling grassland and isolated wetlands typically at c.3500-5200 m altitude with two marked periods: the rainy season from October to April and the dry season from May to September. Most (75%) precipitation falls from November to March in the form of both hail and rain. In Peru the annual precipitation varies from 800 mm in the south to 1200 mm in the central mountains. The mean annual temperatures are less than 10°C and nocturnal frosts are common, especially during the dry season. Diurnal fluctuations can be as much as 20°C in the mesic Altiplano and even greater in the dry or desert Altiplano. The short growing season, as determined by moisture and night-time cloud cover, occurs between December and March. Vegetation is dominated by herbaceous grasses and forbs. Few trees exist and shrubs are only locally abundant. Perennial bunchgrasses are common including the genera Festuca , Poa , Stipa , and Calamagrostis , as well as the grass-like sedges Carex and Scirpus . High-quality forage is more abundant during the rainy season and scarcer during the remainder of the year. A critical habitat and principal source of forage for Alpacas in the Andes that allows intensive-localized foraging are bofedales or mojadales. Providing lush forage and moist vegetation that Alpacas thrive on, bofedales are localized islands of perennial greenery with deep organic soils moistened by subterranean and considerable surface water often forming small pools. Both natural and artificial bofedales exist, some man-made ones dating back to pre-Inca times. These high-altitude marsh areas can provide year-round forage, allowing herders and their animals to remain in the same area for extended periods. Depending upon water availability, they are productive only during the rainy season or throughout the year. As a result, their carrying capacity is highly variable, from 2-8 Alpacas/ha/year. Natural mojadales compared to irrigated artificial ones, typically have greater plant cover with more palatable and nutritious forage. Vegetative composition of bofedales in the humid Puna varies between several dominant species, including Distichia muscoides, Eleocharis albibracteata, Hypochoeris taraxacoides, Hidrocotilo ranunculoides, Liliaopsis andina, and others. A percentage cover of 64-72% of desirable species (Werneria nubigena, Werneria pymaea, Hipochoeris stenocephala, Ranunculos sp., Carex fragilaris) is excellent Alpaca forage. Reported total accumulated bofedal forage (dry weight) from January to August was 1021 kg /ha that grew at an average rate of 4-2 kg/ha/day. Protein ranged 8-3-13-4% and crude fiber 19-2-34-1%. Annual bofedal growth varies with season: 60% during the summer growing season (January-April), 21% during the transition to the dry season (May-June), and 19% in the dry season (July-December). Wet artificial bofedales have greater sustained productivity than natural bofedales with 10-11% protein in both the wet and dry seasons and capable of supporting 3—4 Alpaca/ha/year. Continuous year-round grazing of native grasslands is the most common grazing management practice used by indigenous herders, but technicians are encouraging enhancement of rangeland conditions through rotational grazing and reducing stocking rates of Alpacas and competing sheep. Recommended stocking rate for Alpacas on Andean native pastures is 2-7 animals/ha/year on excellent range, 2 good, 1 average, 0-33 poor, and 0-17 very poor. However, intensively managed, irrigated pastures of grasses and legumes at 3850 m altitude can support 25 Alpacas/ha/year. Research indicates that despite the high elevations and low night-time temperatures, it is possible to increase considerably the sustained carrying capacity of Andean rangeland by the introduction of improved forage species. Managed pastures of irrigated ryegrass ( Lolium perenne) and white clover (Trifolium repens) with application of nitrogen fertilizers can carry up to 30 adult ind/ha compared with the usual rate of 1-1-5 ind/ha on natural grasslands. On Andean rangelands grazed by Alpaca,tall grass communities are commonly set on fire during the dry season (June—October) by native indigenous herders. The objective is the destruction of bunch grasses that will encourage the growth of ground forage preferred by Alpaca and sheep. However, studies have shown that annual burns are not beneficial because they not only stimulate the rapid regrowth of bunchgrasses, but promote hillside soil erosion and encourage the growth of undesirable invasive plant species. Burning every third or more years during the wet season is a more effective approach for improving Alpaca range and habitat.","Historically, an Alpaca was considered to be equivalent to three sheep, but modern animal nutritionists in Peru consider that Alpacas consume 1-2—-1-5 times as much forage as one sheep. Alpacas are selective for these familiar Altiplano plants: Compositae/composites 31 4% (Hipochoires stenocephala, Werneria novigena), followed by Cyperaceae /sedges-rushes 26-1% ( Eleocharis albibracteata, Carexsp.), Gramineae /grasses 19-1% ( Calamagrostis rigescens, Festuca dolichophylla), Rosaceae /roses 14-6% ( Alchemilla pinnata, Alchemilla diplophylla) and minor percentages of Ranunculaceae / buttercups 5:6% ( Ranunculus breviscapus), Leguminosae/legumes 1-7% (Trifolium amabile) and others. Plant leaves,stalks, and flowers with protein content as high as 17-4% are selected by Alpaca when feeding in quality bofedales in the rainy-growing season. Year-round feeding studies on the chemical composition of ingested forage with fistulated Alpacas in Peru and Bolivia yielded the following: dry matter 9-9%, organic material 88-8%, minerals 11-2%, total protein 15-1%, ether extract 7-4%, crude fiber 27-5%, nitrogen-free extract 38-:8%, and detergent neutral fiber 61:6%. General apparent digestibility of bofedal nutrients was dry matter 64-9%, organic material 64-1%, and total protein 64-8%. Total digestible nutrients (TDN) of bofedal forage eaten by Alpacas was similar between the rainy (54-1%) and dry (66:5%) seasons, as was the average energy from TDN at 60-3%. Average daily weight gain per Alpaca grazed on typical (control) bofedales was 0-093 kg, but experimentally at low stocking rates (2 Alpaca/ha/year) weight gain was 0-101 kg/day, medium stocking (4 Alpaca) 0-084 kg/ day, and high stocking (6 Alpaca) 0-079 kg/day. Although the carrying capacity is around one Alpaca/ha/year, overgrazing occurs at 1-8-2-5 Alpaca/ha/year, lowering the quantity and quality of available forage. In indigenous Andean communities where herders own the animals but not the land and the communal grazing lands are used through permission from the community, overgrazing of the natural grasslands is not uncommon. Although efforts are being made to counter the situation, a long history of bofedal overuse by traditional Alpaca herders has frequently resulted in low live ( 50 kg ) and carcass (25-5 kg) weights, reduced fleece weights (1-2 kg), low fertility (35%), and high juvenile mortality (30%). Like Vicunas, Alpacas need frequent water intake. Water consumption by Alpacas grazing on bofedales was high during the dry season at 3-08 kg/animal/day and less in the rainy growing season at 2-04 kg. In another Peruvian study digestibility of high-altitude forage by Alpacas in both Altplano and bofedal habitats was lowest (50-62%) in the winter-dry season and highest (66-76%) in the spring/summer-wet season. Comparative feeding trials measuring the coefficients of digestibility revealed that when fed dry forage low in protein (less than 7-5%) Alpacas were 14% more efficient than sheep, but at high protein levels (greater than 10-5%), sheep were slightly (2%) more efficient. Other studies have reported that Alpacas have a digestion coefficient 25% higher than sheep, particularly on low-quality forage. Maintenance-energy requirements for a 60 kg Alpaca is 2% of its body weight, or 1-2 kg dry forage per day. Alpacas in Peru forage more selectively than Llamas. Diets are highest in grass during the wet and early dry season. As the dry season progresses, the diets of Alpacas in bofedal habitat became largely sedges and reeds (81%). Animals in dryer habitats consume more grass (68%). A study of live weight changes of Alpaca adult males, females, and their progeny, was conducted for three seasons under continuous grazing on natural grasslands on the Mediterranean range of Central Chile . Live weight changes were highest in spring (100-200 g/day), moderate during winter (50-100 g/day), and negative only at the end of summer and in autumn (-110 g/day to — 150 g /day). Weight gains of newborn Alpacas were greatest (110-150 g/day) in the first 90 days after birth and then decreased slightly, reaching values of 75 g /day at 8-5 months old. Weight gainsstabilized at 10-20 g/day at three years of age.","Alpaca females in Peru reach puberty at 60% (33-40 kg) of their adult weight, or at c.12-14 months of age when being grazed on native pastures. Although such young females exhibit sexual behavior, ovulation, fertilization, and embryonic survival similar to adults, most breeders waitto first breed females at two years of age when they have reached greater physical maturity. Male Alpacas in Peru are first used for reproduction at two to three years of age, because the penis is still adhered to the prepuce in one-(84%) and two-year-olds (50%), with all males adhesion free at three years old. The rate of detachment is dependent upon the level of testosterone secreted from the testes. The breeding season is from January to April using several different husbandry techniques. If the females are unfamiliar with the breeding male, they most likely will not accept him. Such males become familiarized by staying with the females in the same stone corral or encircled together by rope for a number of hours each day for 20 days; pregnancy rate is as high at 85% using this method. The most common technique is to run four to six breeding males per 100 females together, year-round. Artificial selection is less controlled by this approach, so males with desired traits are chosen (typically white colored, dense and good quality wool, and normally developed testes 4-5 cm long and 2-5 cm wide). On large, Peruvian Alpaca farms no more than 200 females are run with 10-12 males, half of which are rotated in one-week intervals for two months during the breeding season. Males work well for one week, but then begin to fight with each other and establish hierarchies and harems, thus the rotational system. Alpaca breed and give birth seasonally. When males and females are kept together year-round, births only occur during the rainy season from December to March. The continuous association of the sexes produces an inhibiting effect on the sexual activity of the male. But when males are separated from females and only brought together for breeding, births are year-round. Copulation occurs with the female in sternal recumbency, and lasts 20-50 minutes. Non-pregnant Alpaca have no well-defined cyclical sexual activity (estrus), but are always in the follicular phase and state of receptivity until ovulation is induced by copulation. There is no period of sexual inactivity in Alpaca and other cameloids, nor a relationship between size of ovarian follicle and sexual receptivity. Ovulation occurs ¢.26 hours after copulation. Ovulation can be also be induced by the injection of chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and then occurs c¢.24 hours later. Following ovulation the corpus luteum forms and reaches maximum size and secretory activity at approximately eight days. With no gestation the corpus luteum regresses within 12-18 days after mating, giving way to the formation of new follicles. With conception and gestation, the corpus luteum continues its secretory activity and thereafter the female is not sexually receptive. Pregnancy is assessed by sexual behavior of the female in presence of a new male. Studies have found that at least 85% of the females that ovulate in response to the coital stimulation have at least one fertilized ovum within three days of mating. However, in Peru there is 34% embryonic mortality during the first 30 days of gestation, seriously affecting the annual birth rate of Alpacas. Nearly all (95%) of the pregnancies are in the left horn of the bifurcated uterus, although both ovaries are equally active. Thus, transuterine migration from the right to the left horn of the uterus is common, as evidenced by the corpus luteum in the right ovary and the fetus in the left horn of the uterus. The placenta is simple-diffuse and of the chorial epithelium type. Reproductive studies in Peru on Alpaca mothers (n = 1684) showed that age of the female, year of birth, and the quality of diet were important factors influencing the length of gestation and date of birth. First time mothers at two years of age and those 15 years and older had longer gestation periods (403 and 401 days respectively) than middle-aged females four to twelve years of age (380-390 days). Females grazing on higher quality, cultivated pastures had longer gestation periods than those on native rangelands (389 vs. 379 days). Also in years with favorable vs. poor range conditions, gestation was longer (392 vs. 381 days) and newborns weighed more (8-7 vs. 8-1 kg). The explanation for this may be that females on good forage can afford longer gestations, give birth to a larger young, and be assured that favorable forage will be available for costly lactation. In contrast, females on poor forage have shorter gestations, cannot afford long gestations because of the potential cost of lowering their own health, and need to start lactation as soon as possible while there is at least some forage available before the dry season begins. Age of the Alpaca mother and date of parturition also influenced offspring survival in the Peruvian studies. In a curvilinear fashion, survival of young born to mothers two and three years of age was lower than those with mothers 9-11 years old (82% vs. 91% survival), but declines to 88% for mothers 15 years of age. In Australia , the gestation of spring-mated females is ten days longer than fall-mated females. Birth weight of Alpaca neonates averages 8-4 kg in Peru , with significant variation as indicated among femaleage groups. The importance of good maternal nutrition is critical for such a species with an unusually long gestation. At 180 days or almost half way through gestation the fetus weighs 600 g , only 7% of its eventual 9 kg at birth. Some 93% ofits growth takes place in the last half of gestation, and at 230 days or two-thirds of the way into gestation, a remarkable 72% ofits growth is yet to be gained. The heavy energy demands of lactation lasting 6—8 months, mostly coincides with the Andean rainy, or growing season. Even though multiple ovulations occur c¢.10% of the time, Alpaca twins are extremely rare in Peru and in the USA ; only one out of ¢.2000 births. If neonatal twins do occurthere is a significant difference in size, e.g. 4 kg and 6 kg , with the smaller one typically in the right horn of the uterus dying during gestation resulting in the death of the other. After giving birth the female comes into estrus within 48 hours, but only with initial follicular growth. Follicular size and activity capable of ovulation in response to copulation is observed from the fifth day, but the higher rates offertility begin ten days after parturition with the highest fertility 20-30 days postpartum. The Peruvian Alpaca birth season is from December to May. Females are not separated from the herd due to the lack of space. The umbilical of the newborn is treated with iodine or an herb solution to prevent infection and diarrhea. Newborns are watched closely by the herder to assure first nursing is successful (first milk is high in colostrum, rich in antibodies). Parturition in indigenous herds averages a low 50% and juvenile mortality is high (15-35%); itis estimated that no more than half of the female Alpaca of reproductive age produce young every year. Young born during the birth season also had higher survival than those born late. Additionally, juvenile survival is curvilinearly related to birth weight. Neonates weighing 9-11 kg had an average 92% survival but those weighing 4-5 kg survived at a rate of 30-50%. When pregnant females (n = 424) and their young were monitored,it was found that newborn birth weight, and weight and width of the placenta increased with age of the dam reaching a peak at nine years and then declined progressively. Placental efficiency also increased with female Alpaca age, showing a bimodal shape and peaking at 6-11year-old females; more young died from two-year-old females than any other age; and dead neonates weighed less (6-4 kg) than those that survived (7-8 kg). In indigenous herds, young-of-the-year are usually not weaned due to the lack of extra pastures and the labor involved. Instead, young nurse beyond one year of age, including up to the time the mother gives birth again. To impede the yearling from competing with the newborn for nursing, herders will sometimes temporarily pierce the yearling’s nose with a stick. In commercial Alpaca herds weaning occurs in September through October, sometimes until November, when young are 6-8 months old.","The daily routine or activity pattern of indigenous Alpaca family flocks is quite consistent. After having spent the night in a stone corral or next to the family house (usually a stone hut called a choza), the animals are released or move out on their own to graze for the day soon after sunrise. While the family’s sheep flock is tended by a herder, the Alpaca flock is not accompanied by a herder. Instead,its daily movements and activity patterns while grazing are self-directed within 1-2 km of their home base to local bofedales and other feeding areas of their choice. As sunset approaches, the flock returns to the home site by themselves without being escorted by a herder. Daytime activity budgets (percentage of time) of Alpacas compared to sheep while both species grazed on native-Andean pasture dominated by the favorable forage Festuca dolichophylla, have shown that while other activities were similar, Alpacas fed more (71% vs. 57%) and rested less (11% vs. 25%) than sheep.",,"Alpacas and Llamas were important to ancient Andean civilizations such as the Tiwanaku Culture that dominated the Lake Titicaca region from ¢.300 BC to 1000 Ap, and the Inca Culture that dominated the Central Andes in the 15% and 16"" centuries. When the Incas captured the cameloid-rich kingdoms near Lake Titicaca and south, they acquired giant herds of Llamas and Alpacas. The Incas then sent “seed herds” throughout their empire and commanded that they be reproduced. State-controlled husbandry of Alpacas produced vast herds that numbered into the millions. The Incas placed special emphasis on avoidance of crossbreeding with Llamas and selective breeding of pure-colored Alpacas (brown, black, and white) for quality wool and sacrifice to deities. The Spanish invasion in the 16™ century destroyed that advanced management system and there ensued a breakdown of controlled breeding. Today, the raising of Alpacas in the high altitudes of Peru and Bolivia contributes substantially to the economy of the region. However, animal production is limited by the low level of technology, adverse climate, disease, herders with scarce resources, and frequent over utilization of native rangelands. The Andean grazing system is extensively based upon utilization of native high-altitude grasslands by mixed herds that include not only Alpacas, but sheep and Llamas as well. Pastoralism and mixed agropastoralism form the subsistence base for the agricultural segment of the high Andes. Indigenous communities control the greatest number of camelids and sheep, as well as half of the native rangelands, which comprise ¢.95% ofthe land area above 3800 m . The Alpaca population in South America is c.4-5 million, down some 20% since the mid-1960s, but up 25% from the early 2000s. Today, numbers are at least stable, if not increasing. Most Alpacas are in Peru with 91%, followed by Bolivia 8% and Chile 1%. Few Alpacas occur in Argentina because of the lack of moist Puna and the dominance of the dry Puna. More than 73-87% are in southern Peru ( Arequipa , Cuzco , Moquegua , Puno , and Tacna ), with nearly half of the world’s Alpaca in the Department of Puno . Females represent c¢.70% of the total Alpaca population. A high percentage (85-95%) of Alpacas are owned and managed by native herders in small flocks ofless than 50 animals, but some commercial Alpaca herds are as large as 30,000 -50,000 individuals. Although indigenous herders raise most Alpacas, productivity traditionally has been the lowest due to over stocking, improper health care, and inbreeding. Peru has ¢.789,775 producers raising Alpacas; Bolivia has 13,603, and Chile 916. Starting in the early 1980s Alpacas were exported from Chile , Bolivia , and Peru to the USA , Canada , Australia , New Zealand , and Europe, where cottage industries in Alpaca wool have developed. In the USA the Alpaca Owners & Breeders Association numbered over 4500 members with 143,000 registered Alpacas in 2010. Peru exports c. US $ 24 million worth of Alpaca products (wool, tops, yarns, woven fabrics, and knitwear) annually to countries around the world, especially China , Germany , and Italy . Annual Alpaca wool production in South America is 4-1 million kg (90% from Peru ), yet only represents 0-6% of the world’s fine-fibered wool production (fine sheep wool is ¢.90-95% followed by cashmere at 5-10%). Because of a high market demand for white wool from Huacaya Alpaca, which can be dyed to any desired color, the Alpaca population has become dominated (80-87%) by white individuals. The result has been a scarcity of individuals with pure natural colors and a reduction of genetic diversity in the species. Pure black Alpacas are the rarest. The problem has been recognized and pure natural colors are now beginning to recover. Alpaca wool prices were at their peak from the 1960s-1980s then declined due to land reforms and competition from synthetics. Prices, however, still remain high at four times the value of sheep wool. In North America in its raw state, an ounce of Alpaca varies from US $ 2 to US $ 5. Each stage of the process (cleaning, carding, spinning, knitting, finishing, etc) adds more value to the wool. As a finished garment, it can sell for US $ 10/0z. In addition to its importance as a producer of fine wool, Alpacas have been a valuable source of meat and hides in South America. In the late 1990s some eleven million kilograms of Alpaca meat were produced annually in Peru , representing 10-15% of the country’s total Alpaca population. The best yield and tenderest meat is from animals 1-5-2 years old, but most are slaughtered at 7-8 years old because their wool has become too coarse for economic production. Alpaca meat is healthful, rich in protein and low in cholesterol and fat. Prime cuts are 50% of the carcass and sold either fresh or frozen to meat markets, restaurants, hotels, and supermarkets. Hides are tanned for soft leather products or sold with the fleece intact as wall hangings, rugs, and toys. For indigenous peoples that raise most Alpacas, family income from these animals is primarily from meat (44% fresh, 16% dried) and secondarily from the wool (31%). Despite its excellent quality, the price received for Alpaca meat is 50% less than that for sheep and beef, due to long standing prejudice towards camelid meat. Beginning in the 1960s Peru was the world leader in quality Alpaca research, especially by the progressive staff and visiting scientists working at the La Raya Research Station from Cuzco University. With the export of Alpacas around the globe starting in the 1990s, serious science on this longneglected species and family expanded to a number of countries. Universities in the USA and Australia pursued vigorous research programs into reproduction, disease, genetics, and nutrition. The future for the Alpaca is encouraging. Wide opportunities exist for improved successful Alpaca production in the highlands of Peru and Bolivia , especially if the stewardship of the Alpaca’s principle habitat, bofedales, is improved towards sustained and balanced use.",Allen (2010) | Bravo & Varela (1993) | Bravo | Garnica & Puma (2009) | Bravo | Pezo & Alarcén (1995) | Bryant et al.

Summer precipitation is typically in the form of rain or hail, rarely snow. It is a dry and cold environment with summer nights hovering close to freezing. Winter nights plummet well below freezing, 10-20°C below the daytime highs. Two distinct habitats with different levels of precipitation can be found within this dry-Andean ecosystem: the high-elevation moist or semi-humid high-Andean Puna and the lower elevation dry or semi-arid Puna habitat. The dry Puna is an extremely dry belt called the Andean Dry Diagonal, a north-west/south-east transition zone between two major hemispheric wind belts centered at the junction of north-west Argentina , south-west Bolivia , and north-east Chile . Within the Dry Diagonalthere is essentially no precipitation, no lakes, and no glacier formation. The distribution of subspecies vicugna is within the Dry Diagonal. Subspecies mensalis is found to the north of it. From a landscape perspective the Puna is characterized by peaks and pronounced slopes, the typical elevated plain that defines the region (Puna or Altiplano), and the intermediate piedmont fringes of smooth slopes. Vicunas use the habitats within the Puna and piedmont zones. The most common habitats in the Puna are xerophytic shrub steppes that are often mixed with an understory of sparse short grasses and forbs (typically not an important habitat for Vicunas); bunchgrass steppes (variable importance); open rocky areas with sparse vegetation (not important); short grass and forb areas on lower slopes, gentle slopes, and plains (important); and wetlands of short plants with high ground cover associated with high ground water, surface water, streams, and lagoons, regionally called bofedales, mojadales, and vegas (important). Bofedales (around 4500 m elevation in Peru ) are perennially green sedge communities typically dominated by Eleocharis albracteata and Carex ecuadorica with vegetative cover of ¢.22% grasses, 42% sedges and reeds, and 33% forbs, and a crude protein content of 12%. Short-grass forb areas on lowerslopes (around 3190 m in Peru ) are dominated by the grass species Festuca dolichophylla and Muhlenbergia fastigiata with a vegetative cover of 66% grass, 13% sedges and reeds, and 6% forbs, and a crude protein content of 10%.","As with other ungulate herbivores, Vicuna habitat and forage selection is based not only upon availability, but heavily influenced by climate (wet vs. dry years), population density (high vs. low), and the social status and ranking of individual animals (high vs. low). Thus for studies done at different locations, landscapes, and animal densities,it is not surprising to see variable results. For example in Peru at the Pampa Galeras National Reserve, Vicunas were observed to be strict grazers on grasses and forbs, whereas in Argentina at the Laguna Blanca National Park, Vicunas showed some diet plasticity by being grazers on grasses 16-19% ofthe time and browsers on shrubs 59-72% of the time with two grasses ( Panicum chlorolewcum and Distichlis spp-) representing nearly 50% of the diet. Feeding preference in productive habitats dominated by grasses has been documented in several areas of the Vicuna’s distribution. Of the two main habitats (grass steppe and vegas) at the Ulla-Ulla Vicuna Reserve in Bolivia , Vicunas preferred vegas. In the San Guillermo Biosphere Reserve of Argentina Vicunas were more abundant on the grassland plains. In Pampa Galeras National Reserve Vicunas preferred to forage in grass steppe communities characterized by Festuca nigesens or by Calamagrostis vicunarum, the latter being the dominant species in the vegetative type known as Excrement Influenced Vegetation (EIV). EIV is the result of long-term defecation-urination by Vicunas on dung piles; the resulting fertilization and accumulation of organic matter accelerates soil and plant succession over a long period of time. The third sere is an isolated “putting-green,” an island of short, abundant plants in rocky terrain downhill from a single or series of dung piles. The top soil is deeper and the plants grow thickly, close to the ground. EIV covered 18% of the total surface area of Pampa Galeras National Reserve, andits third sere had the highest productivity and was the most preferred forage vegetation. The general pattern of Vicuna habitat selection for grass-dominated communities, especially those of high nutritional value, is consistent with the results of diet studies that found Vicunas forage mainly on grasses ( Poaceae ) and grass-like sedges (Ciperaceae). When Vicunas coexisted with domestic livestock (sheep, goats, donkeys) in Argentina , they were spatially segregated, had a high overlap in diets, and used preferred habitatless than expected. The native Vicuna and exotic domestic animals coexisted because Vicunas were able to utilize suboptimal habitats while herders kept livestock in the richest habitats. A sympatric population of Vicunas and Guanacos in the San Guillermo Biosphere Reserve, Argentina , revealed that the diet of both species was similar, but Guanacos utilized more tall grasses and Vicuna fed more on forbs and short grasses.","Vicunas are strong seasonal breeders. Males reach sexual maturity at 3-5 years of age, and become reproductive after obtaining a feeding territory and recruiting females. Most females first mate as two-year-olds. Breeding is almost an unnoticeable event except for a short chase before mating, because the prolonged copulation takes place with the mating pair in sternal recumbency. Females show no unusual behavior to indicate they are in estrus and males do not persistently smell the female’s hindquarters as is common in other ungulates. There is no prolonged preoccupation or tending that ungulate males traditionally show for females in heat, because a territorial male has exclusive and immediate access to females within his territory. In Pampa Galeras National Reserve mating was observed from the end of February to the end of May, but peaked in April (3 matings/100 hours of observation), followed by May (1-8) and March (1-3). Almost all matings were in the morning and within the family group’s feeding territory. Gestation averages c.11-3 months (330-350 days). Females within a few weeks of parturition are visibly pregnant. At the start of the birth season at Pampa Galeras over a three year period, a high percentage of females two years of age or older were pregnant: 85%, 95%, and 85%. The non-pregnant females were mostly two-year-olds because only 20% of one-year-olds mated. Rectal palpation by experienced veterinarians of captive adult Vicunas in Puno ( Peru ) revealed 99% of females pregnant. Most (90%) births occurred from the last week of February through the first week of April with 75% of the births in March. February is the reported peak birth season for subspecies vicugna in Argentina and Chile . Nearly all (96%) births occurred in the morning and within the feeding territory. Females give birth to one offspring, with twins not reported or observed. Morning births are likely a behavioral adaptation to the stormy weather typical of Andean afternoons. In summer and early autumn, daily storms regularly start around noon. Young born during the afternoon storms of rain and hail would not be able to dry their soft-insulating wool before entering the nearfreezing nights. Wet newborns would have little chance for survival. A female aboutto give birth separated herself 15-25 m from the group. During the usual one-hour labor the female looked back to inspect her hindquarters, laid down and stood intermittently, changed positions, and walked a few steps every few minutes. Parturition occurred while the female stood. The labor and birthing behaviors were subtle and not easily noticed, as females commonly continued to feed during the process— surely to avoid attracting potential predators in this wide-open habitat. The mother immediately smelled and inspected the head and muzzle of the newborn, but licking did not occur (thus no assistance with the newborn’s thermoregulation) nor was the afterbirth eaten (the latter two behaviors common in other ungulates). Other members of the group frequently came over to smell and inspect the newborn. Newborns weighed 4-6 kg, were on their feet and able to walk in a wobbly way 15-20 minutes after birth, and began nursing when they were 30-45 minutes old. Vicuna young are “followers” as opposed to “hiders” and stay close to their mothers, especially in the first few months. Most young are weaned during the dry season in July and August, when they are 4-6 months old. During the first four months after birth 10-30% of newborns died. The cause was undetermined, but predation by Culpeos (Pseudalopex culpaeus) and Pumas (Puma concolor) was suspected. Reproductive success as measured in August by the ratio of young to adult females ranged 35-70 young per 100 females in different regions of the Pampa Galeras National Reserve. In Chile , density dependency seemed to be operating: the more females in a family group the lower the number of young per female. Very little research has been conducted on the physiology of Vicuna reproduction, but a noteworthy study on reproduction in captive male Vicunas in the Puna of northern Chile found higher levels of plasma testosterone, large testessize, greater size of seminiferous tubules, and large diameters of Leydig cell nuclei beginning in February, a month before the summer breeding season started. In the winter month of August spermatogenesis was in the regressive phase. Both findings suggested photoperiod as the mechanism for when males are sexually effective. Insight can be gained from studies on the Vicuna’s domesticated descendent, the Alpaca: an experimental study on Alpacas demonstrated that the continuous association of females and males exerted an inhibiting effect on male sexual activity. After continuous association of two weeks, there was no mating activity by the male even though receptive females were present. However, when mature males were separated from females and reunited at two week intervals, mating occurred. These observations shed light on why nonpregnant Vicunas (and other cameloids) are not bred during non-breeding seasons of the year.","During a year-round, 3-5yearfield study in Pampa Galeras National Reserve, home to a population of the northern subspecies mensalis, Vicuna family groups showed a predictable daily activity pattern in the large open valleys they occupied. Having spent the night on the upperflat ridges in small sleeping territories, within an hour after sunrise they moved as a group down to their daytime feeding territories. They spent the day on these lower slopes or flat plains, feeding at a constant rate. The sleeping territories, on higher ground, were warmer at night than feeding territories and were away from the streambeds where nocturnal predators hunted. The adult male Vicuna in the family group actively defended both territories by challenging and chasing away trespassing Vicunas. If human disturbance did not cause an early retreat back up the slope, the group returned to its sleeping territory in midto late afternoon. In the winter dry season, when small springs on the slopes dried up, groups left their feeding territory and moved to the center of the valley floor to drink from streams. Solo males holding a territory showed similar patterns. Male groups moved randomly and unpredictably through the area. In a separate study at Pampa Galeras National Reserve conducted during the March—-May breeding season, females spent significantly more time grazing than males (54 vs. 45 minutes/hour) and lactating females fed more than non-lactating females (56 vs. 53 minutes/hour). In general females fed 91% of the time; territorial males fed 75% of the time. In Salinas y Aguada Blanca National Reserve above Arequipa , Peru , there was a positive correlation between frequency of alert behavior per adult and the number of offspring in the family group, and at the Laguna de Pozuelos Biosphere Reserve in Argentina , solitary Vicunas spent more time standing and being vigilant and less time foraging than did members of groups. In Abra Pampa ( Argentina ), territorial males spent more time being vigilant and less time feeding as the size of their family group increased, but not more time in territorial defense (walking, running). At the Laguna Blanca Reserve in Argentina , which is extremely arid, daily activity patterns during the dry season were similar to the patterns of family groups at Pampa Galeras in the same season, with morning feeding on slopes, midday movement to a river on the flat, and a return to the slope and more feeding in the afternoon. At Pampa Galeras there was no significant difference between the amount of time males spent in territorial behavior and the number of female group members or the total group size. Studies at Laguna Blanca on the other subspecies, however, found a substantial decrease in amount of time males spent foraging when the number of females in their group increased.",,"CITES Appendix I, except the populations of Peru , Bolivia , Argentina , and Chile (I Region) which are included in Appendix II. Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List due to its total numbers, wide range of distribution, and occurrence in a number of protected areas. The genetic diversity of the northern subspecies mensalis is relatively low within populations and high between populations, a pattern commonly observed in threatened species with formerly large ranges that became isolated from each other and then suffered drastic demographic contraction. Total area occupied by Vicunas is around 250,000 km ?. The distribution of the two subspecies can be seen as a continuum of scattered and fragmented groups that become less frequent north to south. The small populations of the subspecies vicugna in the south have survived in the Dry Diagonal, an extremely arid zone in the high Andes, where they show a genetic signature of demographic isolation. To the north, the subspecies mensalis populations underwent a rapid demographic expansion in the late Pleistocene due to increased precipitation and the subsequent appearance of highaltitude short grasslands. However, the Dry Diagonal is believed to have prevented both the expansion southward of the northern, moist Puna-adapted forms and the expansion northward of the southern, dry Puna-adapted forms, resulting in the two subspecies found today. The subspecies vicugna is most closely related to the basal taxon,i.e. the species’ primitive extinct ancestor. Both subspecies occur in Bolivia and Chile , but the subspecies mensalis has the highest numbers (73% ofall Vicunas) and widest distribution of the two subspecies. Relative abundance of the southern subspecies vicugna in Bolivia is 34% of 112,249 Vicunas (data from 2009) and in Chile 7% of a minimum 15,544 Vicunas (data from 2007). Majority of the world’s Vicunas in zoos and private collections are of the southern subspecies. The trend for the Vicuna’s general population is increasing. However, as recently as four decades ago, the Vicuna was threatened with extinction. The total population size was as low as 5000-10,000 individuals due to unrelenting poaching for the Vicuna’s valuable wool. In southern Peru the Pampa Galeras National Reserve was established in the late 1960s to protect the largest remaining population. The first international treaty, The Vicuna Convention, was initially between Peru and Bolivia and in 1974 signed by Chile and Argentina . It established national parks, reserves, and private lands for the protection of Vicunas, with the goal of requiring live animals to be shorn. Since that time, programs for the sustainable harvest of Vicuna wool have been successfully applied and Vicuna populations began to increase. Ownership of the wild species varies between countries. In Peru and Bolivia they are the property of the state, while in Chile and Argentina no one owns wild Vicunas. Current population densities vary from 0-9 ind/km* to 1-8 ind/km? for Lauca National Park in northern Chile to as high as 87 ind/km* in Pampa Galeras, although optimum estimated density for Vicuna in Pampa Galeras National Reserve is 40-43 ind/km?. The total number of Vicunas is about ¢.421,500, with 52% in Peru , 27% in Bolivia , 17% in Argentina , 4% in Chile (not including the small number in Ecuador ). Threats remain for the wild Vicuna: poaching; the fact that some protected areas are only “paper parks;” a lack of national management plans; competition with and overgrazing by domestic livestock; mange/scabies infections from domestic animals; crossbreeding of Alpacas and Vicunas for commercial purposes; and management of Vicuna as captive populations. Overall, conservation programs and their tight control at local, national, and international levels are critical for the conservation of this species.",Arzamendia et al.

They inhabit some of most inhospitable terrain in the world, centered in the extreme Gobi Desert of Central Asia. Gobi means “the rocky place” and it is primarily a rocky desert covered with small stones. There are low valleys and eroded hills, rocky-mountain massifs, “hamadas” (flat pavement-like stony plains), vast washed-out plains, high sand dunes, and rarely, poplarfringed oases. Summers are torrid, winters are cold. Annual precipitation is 50-200 mm. This is a region of extreme drought and scarce food and water. The Taklamankan Desert is sandy; Lop Nur Desert is both a rocky and sandy desert. Field studies in the Lop Nur Lake region of China revealed a Bactrian habitat preference for riparian communities and piedmont foothills; they were more often found in higher,hilly landscape than in the open. The Bactrians avoided gravel desert substrate and areas with hard, salt-crusted soil or moving sand dunes, preferring moderately hard ground. They stayed away from areas occupied by people. They used locations where the distance between foraging habitats and water sources did not exceed ¢.50-60 km and where there was relatively high coverage of halophytic vegetation, especially along lakeshores. In Mongolia preliminary results of satellite telemetry revealed a weak preference for habitat dominated by saxaul (Haloxylon ammodendrum) and no selection of areas with higher productivity or closer to permanent water sources. Climate change has altered Bactrian habitat by increasing the rate of desertification and reducing water resources and vegetation. Wild Bactrians have few native predators. Contrary to some accounts, Snow Leopards (Panthera uncia) pose no threat, and although Gray Wolf (Canis lupus) predation does occur,its impact is poorly understood.","Bactrians are opportunistic feeders capable of utilizing low-quality forage when more desirable herbage is unavailable. They are both grazers and browsers. Research on free-ranging domestic Bactrians in wild Bactrian habitat in the Gobi Desert provides the best information available on feeding habits. Those studies found that the camels’ main diet switched from senesced forbs in winter to a shrub in spring and to an increasing dependence on forbs in autumn. Although the shrub Haloxylon ammodendron was the dominant and highest biomass species in this desert community and a staple component of the camels’ diet each season, it was not preferred forage. Still, the shrub was essential when preferred forbs were not available in spring and summer. In autumn preferred annual forbs provided sufficient biomass. New plant growth during the wet season in summer and autumn was vitally important for replenishing the camels’ depleted fat reserves in preparation for winter. Domestic Bactrians are dependent on a year-long forage supply from the fragile and extremely arid environment they occupy. They show a preference for grazing on forbs, but are highly dependent upon browsing on shrubs. It has been reported that Bactrians can utilize salt water, with some researchers stating that salty water is necessary for their survival. When sufficient food is available in spring, summer, and autumn, Bactrians rarely have to drink, obtaining water requirements from plant moisture. In winter they have been observed to eat ice and snow.","Breeding season is called the “musth” after the thick fluid exuded from a gland on the neck behind the head in adult males. A study of semi-captive wild Bactrians found that females reached puberty after three years and males at 5-7 years of age. Wild rutting males in Mongolia begin forming harems in late autumn (November) and mating in early winter, with most mating in January and February, but occasionally as late at March, or even May. Young males are driven out of the harems by rutting males and form bachelor herds; young females remain with their mothers. Males employ spitting (saliva and pseudorumen contents), kicking, biting, and screaming as offensive and defensive behaviors against each other during mating season. During the rut, wild males stretch their necks, shake their heads while roaring, and make loud noises with their teeth. Simultaneously they are foaming/frothing from the mouth and shaking their lips to throw foam on their head and chests. Occasionally they widen their hindlegs to urinate on their tails, using the tail to spread urine on their hips, hump, and head. The concentrated brown secretion from the 1-5 cm x 5 cm gland behind the head is rubbed on the forehump, giving it a darker color. The penis is 4 cm wide x 13-5 cm long. There is no use of dung piles by either sex. Estrous females are usually receptive in January or February for 4-7 days, at which time they follow males, knocking mating males off females and occasionally urinating. To mate, females lift theirtails after lying down in a sternal recumbancy position. Males typically mate with females 2-3 times in the morning or evening for 3-5 minutes each time. After mating, the genitals of females swell and become pink. Females are semen-induced ovulators. Ovulation occurs 30-48 hours after mating. Gestation of semi-captives in Mongolia was 390-430 days (13-14 months) depending upon the age of the female and the number of previous calves. Females give birth to a single offspring while standing, but only every 2-3 years. Spring birth season is from March to April. Females giving birth isolate themselves from other animals and people, remaining alone for about two weeks. Calves are able to stumble-walk within 15-30 minutes. They weigh 32-34 kg at birth and nurse every 1-2 hours. Body growth levels off at seven years. Domestic Bactrians produce ¢.760 I of milk during 16 months of lactation. Calves are commonly weaned at 10-11 months but may nurse for up to 18 months. In captive Bactrians there is liberal and indiscriminate allonursing (adult females nursing non-offspring); this has been observed about one-third of the time, and was not correlated with the age of the mother or relatedness of the calf. Spring to autumn calf mortality is high, at 50%. Poor calf survival is often the result of drought, sandstorms, and freezing temperatures. Aerial surveys in the early 2000s counted only 3-9 young/ 100 adults,significantly lower than surveys in 1980 and 1998. The remaining Bactrian population cannot sustain itself with such a low calf-survival rate. Wild and domestic Bactrian Camels readily interbreed, producing fertile-hybrid offspring that can be differentiated by genetic testing based upon fixed mitochondrial sequence polymorphism. They can live as long as 35 years.","Activity budgets are an indication of an animal’s welfare since its primary activities are centered on energy acquisition, conservation, or expenditure. Bactrian Camels are diurnal feeders and nocturnal sleepers. In winter they spend less time foraging and more time resting than in spring and summer. There is high foraging activity in spring, triggered by readily available shrubs with minimal walking required. Daily patterns of activity are structured to expend the least amount of energy to obtain food, even when the food is not preferred forage.",,"The wild subspecies is classified as Critically Endangered on The IUCN Red List and Endangered by the US Fish and Wildlife Service. It is considered by some to be on the verge of extinction. Protected nationally in China and Mongolia . The Bactrian’s original distribution and natural habitat was the entire Asian Trans-Altai Gobi Desert, stretching from the great bend of the Yellow River in north-east China throughout Mongolia to central Kazakhstan in the west, at elevations 1500-2000 m above sea level in an area that encompassed nearly 100,000 km *. Today they are greatly reduced to a few small and fragmented populations in south-western Mongolia and nearby areas of north-western China in a total area ¢. 28,000 km *. Four populations of wild Bactrians survive: the Taklamakan Desert; Altun Mountains and Archik Valley; and Gashun Desert populations in China ; and the Outer Gobi Desert population of Mongolia and China , which migrates between the two countries. Overall numbers greatly reduced in the past century because of hunting for their meat and hides, habitat loss due to grazing, and competition for water with domestic livestock (domestic camels, sheep, goats, horses, and cattle), interbreeding with domestic camels, mining activities, and poor reproduction and survival of young. Because of harsh climatic conditions, lack of appropriate aircraft for aerial surveys, and the remote and vast region where the remaining Bactrians live, there is uncertainty as to the total numbers remaining. The famous Russian explorer Nikolai Przhevalsky, who is given credit for discovering the wild Bactrian Camel of Asia during his travels to Mongolia and China , noted in 1876: “According to our informants wild camels are numerous in north-western Tsaidam, where the country is barren, the soil being clay, overgrown with budarbana, and so destitute of water that they have to go several miles to drink, and in winter are obligated to satisfy their thirst with snow. The herds are small, averaging five to ten in each, never more than twenty. Their appearanceis slightly different from the domesticated breed: their humps are smaller, the muzzle more pointed, and the color of the hair gray.” It has been reported that wild Bactrians experienced drastic reduction in numbers and range over the past 10-20 years, but the most recent and reliable data suggests that populations in Mongolia have been relatively stable if not increasing. Actual numbers are unclear and little is known. Estimates of total population size from incomplete ground surveys are as low as 730-950 individuals with projections from aerial surveys in Mongolia of 4335 individuals. Attempts to assist with Bactrian conservation efforts in Mongolia through a captive breeding program have been unsuccessful. In China , the population is suspected to be decreasing in the Taklamakan Desert, because of oil development, but not in the Lop Nur Wild Camel National Nature Reserve. The wild Bactrian Camel may well be one of the most endangered large mammals on Earth, and our knowledge ofits basic biology and ecology is dismally poor. Research is needed on the comparative genetics of wild and domestic forms, reproductive physiology, population structure and dynamics, and habitat requirements. Bactrian camels need immediate conservation attention, including standardization of methodology for accurate population surveys in both China and Mongolia ; development of a comprehensive conservation program; increasing support among local people, including control of illegal hunting; habitat improvement; prevention of hybridization with domestic camels that threatens the gene pool of the Mongolian wild camel population, particularly in the Great Gobi “A” Strictly Protected Area and its associated Buffer Zone; and an increase in the number and size of protected areas. The Lop Nur Wild Camel National Nature Reserve in China , a former nuclear test site, is especially critical because it is believed to contain the most genetically pure individuals of the species.",Adiya et al.

In Australia , Dromedaries favor bushy semi-arid lands and sand plains because of the availability of year-round forage, and avoid heavily vegetated and hard rocky areas.","Dromedaries are capable of surviving on poor-quality forage under arid conditions, aided by their ability to select high-quality plant species, increase digestion of low-quality forage, cover large distances while foraging, and diversify the nature of their diet by being both browsers (shrubs and trees) and grazers (forbs and grasses). In the Sahara browse and forbs make up 70% oftheir diet in winter and 90% in summer. Over 300 forage plants have been reported, with Acacia, Atriplex, and Salsola common in their diet. In Syria shrubs dominated the diet during the dry season, but camels switched mainly to herbaceous species with the onset of the wet season. In Australian deserts food intake by volume is 53% browse, 42% forbs, and 5% grasses. Dromedaries browse on trees and tall shrubs up to 3-5 m by grasping with their lips and either breaking off branches or stripping leaves. Under extreme cases of limited forage, the Dromedary can not only decrease its food intake, but also reduce its metabolic rate. Compared to sheep and cattle, Dromedaries require less energy for maintenance; their protein requirements are at least 30% lower than cattle, sheep, or goats. Feeding trials have revealed that Dromedaries utilized fed energy for maintenance with an efficiency of 73% comparable to sheep, and for growth with an efficiency of 61% better than sheep and cattle. The relationship of food intake to body size is low. They can live on only 2 kg of dry matter for limited periods, and 8-12 kg are sufficient for a working Dromedary carrying 130-227 kg load for six hours a day at a speed of 5 km /h for a 24day trip. When forage conditions are lush, camels tend to overeat for their immediate needs and store the excess energy in their humps. Dromedaries require six to eight times more salt than other animals, with 30% oftheir diet from halophytes (plants that tolerate and even require salty conditions). High salt intake is imperative for alimentary absorption of water by camels, with salt deficiencies leading to cramps and cutaneous necrosis. Although consumption of grain can cause indigestion in animals unaccustomed to it, working Dromedaries require 2 kg of grain per day.","The breeding season is variable depending upon latitude and climate patterns. Dromedaries typically breed in winter, except near the Equator, where there can be two mating seasons or even year-round mating. In the Arabian camel, sexual receptivity is triggered by rainfall and subsequent availability of forage. There is follicular activity in the female year-round, but it peaks in winter and spring. Mating induces ovulation, which occurs 30-40 hours afterwards; estrus ceases three days later. An unmated female's cycle averages 28 days;follicles mature within six days, are maintained for 13 days, and regress over eight days. The percentage of females that conceived: 50% after a single copulation, 30% after two, and 20% after three or more, during the first two days of estrus. Left and right ovaries are equally active and alternate in follicle production. Egg migration is common, 50% of left-horn implants form corpora lutea in the right ovary, explaining the long oviductal transport time of six days. Simultaneous ovulation from both ovaries occurs 14% of time, but twin pregnancies only 0-4%. The left horn of the uterus is larger than the right and carries 99% of pregnancies. Normal pregnancy produces one offspring, with twins being extremely unusual. The scrotum is high in the perineal region with testes larger during rut. Penis is covered with a triangular sheath opening pointing posteriorally and directed between the hindlegs. A complete separation of the penis from preputial adhesions prevents erections at 6-10 months before sexual maturity. Female lies down in sternal recumbency during copulations averaging 8-120 minutes involving 3-5 ejaculatory pulses by the male, each stimulated by intracervical pressure on his highly mobile urethral process. Mating females normally ruminate; the male may salivate, inflate his dulla, or gurgle during mating. Gestation averages 377-390 days (range of 360-411 days), regardless of whether the calf is male or female. The typical calving interval is 2-3 years (two in Australia ), with estrus occurring 4-5—-10 months after parturition. The mean birth massis 37-3 kg (26-4-52-3) with no difference between sexes. Annual calving rates are low (35-40%) because of high (18-20%) embryonic death, abortions, and stillborns. In free-ranging herds, young remain with their mothers for first two years. Males begin rutting at three years but are not fully active sexually until they are 6-8 years old. They continue to breed until 18-20 years of age. Females are sexually mature at three years and typically first mate at 4-5 years and reproduce until they are 20-25, and some until the age of 30. Puberty is delayed by inadequate body weight caused by insufficient food. Birthing duration is typically 30 minutes, with the female in a sitting position. The mother noses and nibbles, but does not lick her newborn. The main birth season in Australia is June to November, during the rut, but newborns have been observed year-round. Before parturition cows segregate themselves (without their previous twoyear-old calf) from their original group and give birth in seclusion in dense vegetation. Isolation thought to be both an anti-predator behavior and perhaps more significantly, avoidance of infanticide by rutting males. After remaining alone for up to three weeks, when the new calf is fully mobile, the female joins other recent new mothers, forming a new cow group. These core groups remain stable until the calves are weaned at 15-18 months, the length of time depending on environmental conditions. Life span of wild/feral animals is 20-35 years. Domestic Dromedaries live substantially longer, with reported maximum longevity 40-49 years. The first cloned camelid was a Dromedary Camel achieved in 2010 by use of somatic cell nuclear transfer.","Wild/feral populations exist only in Australia , where they show a daily pattern of feeding in the morning and afternoon hours and increased resting in the middle of the day. Midday resting is highest in winter. Elsewhere Dromedaries are domestic and intensely managed and regulated by traditional pastoral communities, often in conjunction with other livestock. In the Sahara, when they are allowed to roam without herders, they form stable groups of 2-20 animals. Dromedaries graze for 8-12 hours per day and then ruminate for an equal amount of time. When forage is especially poor they spread out over large areas and break up into units of 1-2 individuals. Guarded herds feed by day (lying down during the hottest hours) and rest by night, but unguarded, their activity pattern is reversed.",,"World Dromedary population decreased 15% from 1960 to 2000, with current numbers 18-21 million, including one million camels in Australia . In some countries the decline has been severe over the last century; for example in Syria the population decreased from 250,000 in 1922 to not more than 22,000 in 2010. In Australia Dromedary competition with livestock for forage and water, and significant environmental and infrastructure damage caused by Dromedaries, have prompted culling, with the goal of maintaining a sustainable population for utilization of their meat, hides, and wool. Despite groups of Dromedaries seen moving and grazing without a herder in the Sahara and Arabian deserts, they all have owners. Numbers have drastically declined in Arabian countries during past half century due to modernization and industrialization, forced settlement of nomads, desert forage resources not well developed, low reproductive rate, decreased demand for camel meat and milk, poor genetic selection for breed improvement, and government encouragement of other domestic species.",Al-Ani (2004) | Arnautovic & Abdel-Magid (1974) | Baker (1964) | Baskin (1974) | Bhargava et al.

The forest types where the Bengal Slow Loris is found are probably even more variable, because the geographic range is so large, but the species remainslittle studied. It is known to occur close to agricultural fields and plantations but is usually found in habitats with interconnecting branches and vines up to 20 m above the ground. The Bengal Slow Loris occurs at elevations from sea level to 2400 m. Individuals tend to use large diameter and tall trees, with greater crown depths, and tend to avoid habitats with sparsely crowned trees.","Two of four recent studies found that gum is extremely important to the Bengal Slow Loris. Gum of Bauhinia ( Fabaceae ) lianas is commonly eaten in Thailand. In Tripura, India, gum is not a fallback food but preferred, because Bengal Slow Lorises feed on exudates 67-94% of the time, depending on the season. They also feed on nectar, fruit, bark, invertebrates, and bird eggs. They lick and scrape insects and gums off bark and also gouge holes to stimulate gum flow. In Cambodia, they eat leaves of Terminalia alata ( Combretaceae ), flying insects that they catch with one hand, and tree bark.","Data on the breeding behavior of the Bengal Slow Loris are not available from the wild. The following data from the Duke Lemur Center are from individuals labeled as the Sunda Slow Loris (N. coucang) but that seem to be in the size range of the Bengal Slow Loris. The majority of animals in this colony at the Duke Lemur Center are Bengal Slow Lorises, but a few are Sunda Slow Lorises and some are definitely hybrids, so the Center’s data should be viewed with caution. Females born in the colony copulate for the first time at 18-24 months old. A male that reached sexual maturity in the colony sired hisfirst offspring at 17 months old. Estrous cycles were 29-45 days, with copulations usually occurring during one day of estrus. Gestation averaged 192-2 days. Although a postpartum estrus was observed in three cases following infant death, no conceptions resulted. Lactation lasts approximately six months.","The Bengal Slow Loris is nocturnal and arboreal. In Cambodia, they are significantly more active under little moonlight than during bright moonlight. This predator-rich environment was also more open, and individuals had to move across vulnerable habitat; lunar phobia is likely a valuable tactic to lorises in such a situation.",,"CITES Appendix I. Classified as Vulnerable on The IUCN Red List. All species of Nycticebus were transferred from Appendix II to Appendix I of CITES in June 2007 due to increasing and unsustainable international trade. The Bengal Slow Lorisis protected throughoutits range under the national laws of India, Bhutan, Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, China, and Thailand. Despite this and the upgrade to CITES Appendix I, abuse and trade certainly continues in Cambodia and undoubtedly throughout its range. It is threatened by loss of habitat. hunting for food, and use in traditional Asian medicine. In Cambodia, large numbers of dried lorises can be seen in market places, where they are sold in the belief that they provide a tonic for women after childbirth, are helpful for stomach problems and promote the healing of wounds and broken bones, and can serve in the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases.

The Sunda Slow Loris can be found in forest edge among interconnecting branches and vines, up to 20 m above the ground. It also occurs in relatively urban areas, feeding near street lamps.","Diet of the Sunda Slow Loris includes mainly fruits, supplemented with leaves, shoots, saps, gums, flowers, seeds, bird eggs, and animal prey (including insects and the occasional bird). Its diet in Malaysia comprised five food types: floral nectar and nectar-producing parts mainly from flowers of the bertram palm (Eugeissona tristis, Arecaceae), phloem sap,fruits, gum, and arthropods. The largest proportion of feeding time was spent on phloem sap (34:9%), floral nectar and nectar-producing parts (31:7%), and fruits (22:5%). Sunda Slow Lorises gouge with their toothcomb to extract gum, excavating large holes in the wood of trees, and use their long tongues to lap it up. Their slow metabolic rate is linked to detoxifying toxic compounds in this plantrich diet.","Breeding may occur at any time of the year. Female Sunda Slow Lorises are at peak sexual receptivity every 42 days, and their mating call tends to increase in frequency at this time. Normally, a single young is born (occasionally twins) after a 185— 197day gestation. It is difficult to know how accurate this gestation length is because most slow lorises in captivity seem to be Bengal Slow Lorises or hybrids. Newborns are gray with silvery-white limbs and hands, with long glistening hairs that disappear after about eleven weeks. Young cling to their mother until they are four to six weeks old. She then parks them. Rather than learning how to choose food sources by scrounging from the mother, infant Sunda Slow Loris seem to use other mechanisms, one of which may be scent because this species vigorously scent-marks both floral nectaries and gum sites. Captive individuals live for 20 years or more.",The Sunda Slow Loris is nocturnal and arboreal. It is a slow climber but capable of rapid and steady movement through a continuous canopy. It prefers the small-branch niche but can move on trunks and on the ground to cross roads and fields.,,"CITES Appendix I. Classified as Vulnerable on The IUCN Red List. Despite legal protection in Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia, Sunda Slow Lorises are frequently taken for use in the pet and medicinal trade, and they are occasionally shot as a crop pest. For the pet trade, incisors are often removed before sale, frequently causing infection and death; if an individual survives and is confiscated, it cannot be rehabilitated for release into the wild. They are frequently killed when crossing powerlines and roads. Although the Sunda Slow Loris is adaptable to various human-induced habitat changes, severe loss of forest cover is a serious threat. They are known to occur in Berbak, Gunung Leuser, and Kerinci-Seblat national parks in Indonesia and Klong Yan Wildife Sanctuary in Thailand.

The Pygmy Slow Loris can survive in highly degraded habitats. Flowering trees are most attractive to these animals.","The Pygmy Slow Loris is a faunivore-frugivore and specialized gum feeder. Consumption of saps and gums is similar to other lorises, and it is described here in detail for illustration. Pygmy Slow Lorises consume sap and gum from as low as 1 m to as high as 12 m off the ground. They perforate the superficial layer of the cambium of trees or lianas by scraping with their toothcomb. Lapping exposed sap with the tongue lasts from a few seconds to about four minutes, with intermittent additional breaking of the hard surface. Gum is consumed for a longer period, from two to 20 minutes, and involves gouging with anterior teeth. In most cases,trees already have wounds from larval infestation, prior injury, orfire, although lorises can also gouge into undamaged wood to induce gum flow. Lorises scoop up the gum, anchoring their upper incisors into the bark or into the solidified gum. In this manner, Pygmy Slow Lorises can also gouge into bamboo to find insects, and they appear to scrape lichens and fungus off the surface of old bamboo with their toothcomb. Until recently, no species of loris has been observed to gouge gum with its molars. Pygmy Slow Lorises in Cambodia eat “icicles” of gum exuded from open wounds, and while holding them in one hand, they alternately chew on them with their molars and lick them. Lorises search for their gum sources. Nosedown searching may accompany investigating for sap on branches, or searching along bamboo to find a location to gouge for insects. Visible and audible sniffing sometimes accompanies these searches. On gum trees without active wounds, Pygmy Slow Lorises race up and down a single trunk, making up to 20 trial holes before feeding. Trees with open wounds seem to be known to individual lorises; they make rapid and directed movement to a feeding site. When gouging begins, bark breaking can be audible to humans from a distance of 10 m. A loris may turn its head side to side while spitting out bits of bark; this side-to-side movementis often accompanied by scent marking of the wound with facial glands. Pymgy Slow Lorises consume bits of bark in this process. The more noisy process of gouging bamboo involves a loris anchoring its rear feet against the bamboo and bashing its toothcomb into the very hard surface; this behavior also results in shaking of the bamboo stand and is audible up to 100 m away. Pygmy Slow Lorises also eat flowers, geckos, small fruits, nectar, and numerous invertebrate prey.","Females reach maturity at 14 months of age and give birth at 19-37 months; malesfirst reproduce at 27-37 months. Adult males have a large testis volume. Estrus lasts 6-11 days. Gestation is 187-198 days. In the wild, Pygmy Slow Lorises give birth to twins that are carried for their first two to three weeks, after which the mother tends to park them while she forages She moves them to a new spotif she senses that they will be disturbed. Infant mortality is high. Infants are almost weaned within 24 weeks. In captivity, the interbirth interval is 13-30 months.","The Pygmy Slow Loris is nocturnal and arboreal. This supposedly slow climber moves rapidly on small branches from the ground to the highest point in the canopy. It makes use of long bamboo connectors to move across the arboreal pathway. During a radio-tracking study in Cambodia, the activity pattern of the Pygmy Slow Loris was 27% traveling, 22% alert, 20% sleeping, 5% feeding, 3% autogrooming, and 6% diverse, less common, behaviors; 17% of the records were unknown activities. Pygmy Slow Lorises only increased activity on bright moonlit nights as ambient temperatures increased, yet they were consistently active regardless of temperature on dark nights. The most plausible explanation for these patterns is the combined risk of predation (as a result of their anti-predator strategy) and heat loss on cool bright nights resulting in lunar phobic behaviors.",,"CITES Appendix I. Classified as Vulnerable on The IUCN Red List. The Pygmy Slow Loris is legally protected in China, Vietnam, and Cambodia. Nevertheless,it is still heavily exploited for use in traditional Asian medicine and the pet trade, and it is occasionally eaten. As a result, the overall population has likely declined by 30% over the past 24 years. In Cambodia, large numbers of dried lorises, more Pygmy than Bengal slow lorises, can be seen in markets, where they are sold in the belief that preparations made with them are, for example, a tonic for women after childbirth and helpful for stomach problems, treatment of sexually transmitted diseases, and useful for healing wounds. Beliefs in their curative powers are strong, and people are reluctant to accept alternative medicines. Habitat loss is also a threat, mainly due to agriculture. Wild populations of the Pygmy Slow Loris appear to be in major decline, but it does occur in numerous protected areas in Cambodia, China, Laos, and Vietnam. Detailed surveys of the status of the Pygmy Slow Loris in these areas is needed. It also occurs in at least 50 captive collections.",Alterman & Hale (1991) | Dao Van Tien (1960) | Duckworth (1994) | Fisher et al.

They prefer dense forest that provides continuous walkways through the vegetation.","Diet is known from limited observations: analyses of stomach contents and controlled taste tests of wild animals in field conditions. The Golden Angwantibo is mainly insectivorous, consuming animal prey, especially caterpillars and other noxious prey ignored by the up to five sympatric nocturnal primate species with which it might occur. Insects are supplemented with fruits and gums. In Gabon, 85% of the diet was insects, 14% fruit, and 1% wood fiber, with the most common prey being caterpillars (65%) and beetles (20%). The Golden Angwantibo often forages in the undergrowth below a height of 5 m but occasionally to 15 m. It sometimes feeds on the ground, probably using scent and olfaction. Angwantibos hold caterpillars by the head with their mouth and wipe their hands along the caterpillar’s body, for up to 20 seconds, to removeirritating hairs.

The potto has a larger brain than predicted from its low metabolic rate. When faced with predators, all species of pottos are equipped with three physical adaptations that make them a formidable adversary: a scapular shield produced by a combination of raised apophyseal cervical spines, some of which protrude above the skin in the form of tubercles, covered by thick skin and bristles of sensory hair, that offers protection, defense, and acute sensitivity; muscular hands that allow the potto to firmly grip a substrate without falling off (a potto can support up to 15 times its weight); and the retia mirabilia of the proximal limbs, a dense web of blood vessels that allow stillness for extended periods. The potto first faces a predator uttering a series of grunts, open-mouthed, and butting with the shield. If it fails to dislodge the predator, the potto simply drops to the ground, moves rapidly through the undergrowth and disappears to safety.

Infant Milne-Edwards’s Pottos are white and can have blue eyes. A mother carries her infant clinging to the ventrum until it is 3-4 months of age. After that time, the infant is parked among branches and lianas while the mother forages. She retrieves the infant before dawn, and both infant and mother utter high-pitched “tisc” contact calls.

In the only detailed long-term study of the species’ diet, 96% ofall feeding events focused on animal prey, the majority of which were ants and termites. In addition to spiders, mollusks, and lizards, other key insect orders in the diet include: Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, Orthoptera, Odonata, Hemiptera, and Diptera. Lorises are able to eat insects with high levels of secondary compounds, accompanied by pre-ingestive urine washing, or slobbering and urine washing during ingestion. Gray Slender Lorises are terminal branch specialists that catch their prey visually with one or two hands, and they use acrobatic postures in the more dangerous and swaying branches. Lorises infrequently feed on gums and legume pods, but they can make holes in bark through active gouging. Observations of the Sri Lankan forms are in accordance with those of longer-term studies in India. The Northern Ceylon Slender Loris was observed to eat only insect or animal prey, including lizards and snails. They nearly always detect their prey with their eyes and engage in acrobatic suspensory postures to catch their prey items. They grasp the prey with one or two hands, and prey items are rarely caught and eaten directly with the mouth. Northern Ceylon Slender Lorises do not appear to eat gum or drink water, and the only non-insect item they appear to eat is nectar from a flowering Cassia roxburghii ( Fabaceae ). In captivity, the Highland Slender Loris feeds on tree frogs, geckos, and large insects.","Copulation patterns are similar among the two species of Loris. Mating can occur after play wrestling, but it most often commences after many males have pursued a female. Usually, males move into an area a few days before a female enters full estrus and start to follow her and try to groom her. These interactions can result in violent fights between males. During the pursuit, the males utter “krik” calls at irregular intervals and try to inspect the female’s genitals. The female may give defensive threats, but when she is ready to be mounted, she signals with a suspensory posture. Copulations take place with the male clinging to the female, who is suspended quadrupedally. A female supports herself by all four limbs orjust her hindlimbs. A single copulation may last 2-16 minutes and is ended with the female giving low-intensity threat gestures toward the male. Sometimes the male produces a liquid that forms a vaginal plug. Both sexeslick their genitals after copulation. Gray Slender Lorises give birth to singletons or twins after a gestation of 157-162 days. Births occur throughout the year. A female gives birth in a sitting or a hanging posture. Newborns have partially opened eyes. After birth, the mother may defend the infants against conspecifics if they become overly curious, but often she will allow an adult male from her social group to groom her and her offspring. The newborn clings to the mother’s belly for the first few weeks oflife. Weaning occurs after 148 days. The infantis carried less when it is 2-3 months old, and it may be parked while the mother goes off to feed.","The Gray Slender Loris is nocturnal and arboreal, and it moves quadrupedally in trees. Although it can move slowly when threatened,it is generally silent and swift. It prefers to move on the top of branches. Gaps between branches are crossed by using horizontal bridging, whereby hindlimbs hold on to a substrate while forelimbs grab for the desired branch. Three limbs are usually holding a support branch when moving in a quadrupedal fashion. The Gray Slender Loris is capable of rapidly scaling a large tree trunk or scampering along other large substrates, although it prefers small supports that it can clasp firmly in its hands. It crosses roads and agricultural fields when necessary.",,"CITES Appendix II. Classified as Least Concern on The [UCN Red List. The subspecies grandis and nordicus are classified as Endangered, and the nominate subspecies and malabaricus are classified as Near Threatened on The IUCN Red List. The principal threat is loss of habitat. Loris eyes are valued in traditional Asian medicine because of the local belief that they contain certain properties that are effective against ocular complaints. In India, the eye of the loris is also widely used as a love charm in a preparation that is claimed to be helpful in seducing and kidnapping a woman. The Mysore Slender Loris is reported from three protected areas: Sri Venkateswara National Park and Biligiri Rangswamy Temple and Nelapattu wildlife sanctuaries in India. The Malabar Slender Loris is reported in Periyar National Park and a number of wildlife sanctuaries in India, including Aralam, Brahmagiri, Griz zled Giant Squirrel, Idukki, Indira Gandhi, Kalakkad-Mundanthurai, Parambikulam, Peechi-Vazhani, Shendurney, Someswara, Thattakkad, and Wynad. In Sri Lanka, the Northern Ceylon Slender Loris is reported from reserves and sanctuaries of Ampara, Girithale, Mihintale, Polonnaruwa, Ritigala, Sigiriya, and Thangamale; national parks of Angammedilla, Flood Plains, Kaudulla, Maduru Oya, Minneriya, Somawathiya, Wasgamuwa, Wilpattu, and Yala; and forest reserves of Kanthale and Menikdena.

The subspecies tardigradus is found in the wet lowland forests up to 470 m above sea level. Its habitat is heavily fragmented. It uses small twigs, lianas, and vines for movement, and it also forage on the ground. The Horton Plains Slender Loris is found in central Sri Lanka at elevations of 1800-2300 m in montane mist forests. It has been observed moving on the ground and crossing roads, and it is often seen low down in stunted vegetation. Vicinity to human populations negatively impacts the Red Slender Loris ; it is rarely found in home gardens and seems to require continuous canopy to move between forest patches.","In 1905,|. Still suggested that lorises were completely insectivorous, even carnivorous. Wild Red Slender Lorises have only been seen eating animal prey. They eat insects (including moths, stick insects, dragonflies, beetles, cockroaches, and grasshoppers), lizards ( Calotes , Agamidae ), and geckos. They have not been seen eating birds, but the speed with which they can grasp prey and kill with a bite to the head suggests this is possible. At Masmullah Proposed Forest Reserve, lorises were found in high abundance in areas with Humboldtia laurifolia ( Fabaceae ), a tree that has a mutualistic relationship with ants and provides abundant food for lorises. Nothing is known of the diet of the Horton Plains Slender Loris .","Dominant males may form partnerships with smaller beta males—coalitions to pursue estrous females. Males gather when a female is in estrus, some coming from other parts of the forest, and vocal battles are common. Gestation is 165-175 days; one twin birth in captivity occurred after 174 days. Births occur throughout the year, and singletons are more common than twins. Mothersstart to park their infants when they are about two months old, remaining near and rushing back to retrieve the infant at any sign of danger. Females have a 29-40day sexual cycle, with genital swelling and reddening at estrus. Individuals may live up to 15 years. Only one birth has been witnessed for the Horton Plains Slender Loris.","The Red Slender Loris is nocturnal and arboreal. Although lorises are thought to be slow climbers, kinematic studies revealed that the nominate subspecies tardigradus can move at speeds of 1-3 m/second. In a secondary tree-fall area, Red Slender Lorises are small-branch specialists, most often moving on supports less than 5 cm in diameter and only occasionally selecting branch clusters or substrates larger than 5 cm in diameter. Overall, they do not have strong preferences with respect to branch orientation. Rapid quadrupedalism is used on arboreal supports of all diameters and orientations, but individuals have never been seen moving on the ground. The Horton Plains Slender Loris moves very much like its low-country counterpart and is also capable of incredible speed. It has been observed at low heights (2 m above the ground), and it crosses open ground. It also will occur in the highest trees available, for example, in alpine scrub at heights of 4 m.",,"CITES Appendix II. Classified as Endangered on The IUCN Red List. The Red Slender Loris is threatened mainly by loss of habitat, and the nominate subspecies tardigradus particularly by gem mining. Individuals are regularly sold illegally in bazaars as pets, and they are valued in traditional medicine and killed because of superstitious folk beliefs. All populations are likely declining and at low levels, with as few as 1500 tardigradus in only c.3000 ha of highly fragmented forests and a critically low number of 80 nycticeboides in the Horton Plains, Sri Lanka. The subspecies tardigradus occurs in Udawalawe National Park; the sanctuaries of Attidiya-Belanwila, Kurulukele, Peak Wilderness, Udawattekele, Victoria-Randenigala-Rantambe; and forest reserves of Ingiriya, Kanneliya, Kombala-Kottawa, Oliyagankele, Polgahaivalakande, Kakanadura, Dandeniya Aparekka, and Godakawela.

The species commonly inhabits tropical lowland South American moist and swamp forests, but also can be found in a wide range of other habitat types, including xeric Chaco and Cerrado forest, savanna wetlands, and lower montane forests, at elevations up to 2000 m . There are six main habitat categories where Lowland Tapirs can be found: tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests; tropical and subtropical moist to seasonally moist montane forests; tropical and subtropical dry forests, savannas, and shrublands; tropical and subtropical seasonally moist grasslands and savannas; montane grasslands; and mangroves. During a long-term Lowland Tapir field study in the Atlantic Forests of Morro do Diabo State Park, Sao Paulo , Brazil , tapirs strongly selected riparian environments and marshes, where they performed most of their main activities, particularly foraging. They avoided areas of agriculture and pasture land, as well as secondary growth forests. Palm forests are known to be important habitats, and they also frequent saltlicks, particularly in the Amazon. In the north-eastern region of the Brazilian Pantanal, tapirs show high preference for Acuri palm (Scheelea phalerata) forests. In the semi-deciduous Atlantic Forest, they prefer areas ofJeriva palm ( Syagrus romanzoffiana ) forests. The Jeriva is the most abundant and widespread palm species in the semi-deciduous Atlantic Forest. In the Amazon, patches of moriche palm (Mauritiaflexuosa) are used intensively by tapirs. During the study in Morro do Diabo State Park, tapirs moved fairly easily through areas of non-habitat between patches of forest. These pathways included pastures and croplands, especially sugar cane, soy bean, and corn plantations. In some instances, tapirs crossed areas of forest regeneration, degraded forest corridors, and riparian forests along small rivers. Lowland Tapirs also cross eucalyptus plantations between fragments of Atlantic Forest in Espirito Santo State , Brazil .","Due to their diet and stomach anatomy, Lowland Tapirs are closer to the browser side of the grazer-browser-frugivore continuum. There is some geographic variation in the composition of their diet. In the Peruvian Amazon, the species consumes 33% fruit and 66% leaf and fiber. The diet of Lowland Tapirs in the semideciduous Atlantic Forest consists of 37% fruit and 63% leaf and fiber. In the tropical rainforests of French Guiana their diet comprised 24-4% fruit, 22-3% leaf, and 53-2% fiber. In the Bolivian Chaco, the diet was 16-8% fruit, 62% leaf, and 21-2 % fiber. Tapirs selectively browse vegetative parts of different food plants. More than 170 species of fruits in over 60 different plant families have been identified as eaten by Lowland Tapirs throughout their range. In the Peruvian Amazon, they consumed 122 species of fruit from 33 plant families, and in the semi-deciduous Atlantic Forests of Brazil , they consumed 58 species of fruit from 23 plant families. Palm fruits are among the most important food resources, especially during the dry season when other species of fruit are less available. Mauritiaflexuosa is the single most important food item (76%) in the diet of Lowland Tapirs in the Peruvian Amazon. The distribution of these palm patches appears to strongly influence the movement patterns of tapirs in the area. In addition, tapirs are efficient dispersers of Mauritia flexuosa seeds. In Morro do Diabo State Park, Brazil , Syagrus romanzoffiana was the most frequently found fruit (18:4%) in Lowland Tapir fecal samples. In the Bolivian Chaco, Lowland Tapirs have successfully adapted to seasonal droughts, and to diets that include a large proportion of cactus fiber.","There is very little information about the reproduction of Lowland Tapirs in the wild. Overall, the four species of tapirs have very slow reproductive cycles. Adult females usually produce a single offspring after a lengthy gestation period of 13-14 months (390-410 days). Twin births are very rare. Only one has been recorded in the AZA Studbook for Lowland Tapirs. Female tapirs are polyestrous, with an estrous cycle of 28-32 days. The estrous period lasts 1-4 days. Postpartum estrus is possible 9-27 days after the calf is born. Thus, a female Lowland Tapir may conceive within a month after giving birth. In the wild, under the best circumstances, in habitats exhibiting little seasonality in food availability, a young can be born every 14 months. In seasonally dry habitats, the interval between births may be longer. The interbirth interval for captive individuals can be as high as 18 months. Captive Lowland Tapirs are usually sexually mature by 14-24 months and conceive at an average of 3-7 years of age. Recent results coming from the AZA Studbook for Lowland Tapirs show that females reach sexual maturity at 19 months of age (1-6 years) and first reproduce at 32 months (2-7 years). In addition, the Studbook estimated that the maximum age of reproduction for the species is 15-3 years for females and 18-7 years for males. A Lowland Tapir Population and Habitat Viability Assessment (PHVA) Workshop held in 2007 modelled the dynamics of the species’ populations in the wild. Given that natural situations impose a toll on the animals, age offirst reproduction in the wild was estimated to be four years, and maximum age of reproduction 20 years for both females and males. Thus, the generation length of wild Lowland Tapirs was estimated to be eleven years. The sex ratio at birth in captivity is 3:1. The sex ratio observed in Morro do Diabo, Brazil , was 1:1-33. Monitored subsistence hunting among the Waimiri Atroari Indians in the central Amazon of Brazil recorded a sex ratio of kills of 1:1:03. Therefore, the sex ratio at birth in the wild is generally assumed to be 50% males and 50% females. Data on Lowland Tapir longevity comes from captivity and reveals that these animals live over 35 years.","Tapirs are predominantly nocturnal and crepuscular. Lowland Tapir rest during the day and begin their activity after sunset, at around 18:00 h. In the semi-deciduous Atlantic Forests of Morro do Diabo State Park in Brazil , their main periods of activity are from 19:00 h to 00:00 h, with a peak between 20:00 h and 21:00 h (63% active); and from 01:00 h to 07:00 h, with a peak between 05:00 h and 06:00 h (60% active). Tapirs in Morro do Diabo are largely inactive between 11:00 h and 16:00 h. Overall, tapirs in Morro do Diabo foraged for approximately five hours in the early evening, and then seemed to rest for a few hours in the middle of the night. There followed a second foraging bout, of approximately six hours in the early hours of the day. Tapir activity patterns were analyzed separately for wet and dry season, as well for both sexes and different age classes in Morro do Diabo, and were fairly consistent. In Kaa-Iya del Gran Chaco National Park, Bolivia , tapirs are mostly active between 18:00 h and 22:00 h, and between 00:00 h and 06:00 h, with a main activity peak between 01:00 h and 06:30 h, and very little activity between 11:00 h and 15:30 h. In the Peruvian Amazon, tapir activity peaks were observed between 19:00 h and 20:00 h and between 03:00 h and 04:00 h, with the main foraging time between 21:00 h and 03:00 h. Nocturnal line-transect sampling in Morro do Diabo State Park allowed for an analysis of the effect of moonlight intensity on tapir activity. Approximately 47% of the tapir encounters occurred during the waning crescent, 21% during the new moon, 18% during the waxing crescent, and only 14% during the full moon. It was clear that tapirs in Morro do Diabo were considerably less active during the brighter phases of the moon. Previous studies suggested that a lower level of animal activity during moonlit nights is a result of higher predation risk. In El Rey National Park, Argentina , tapirs were typically diurnal, perhaps due to lack of human disturbance.",,"CITES Appendix II. Classified as Vulnerable on The IUCN Red List. Although the species has been listed as Vulnerable across its entire range, several populations in Argentina , Brazil , Colombia , and Venezuela present considerably higher levels of threat. A few examples include tapir populations in the Atlantic Forest and Cerrado biomes in Brazil , as well as Colombian and Venezuelan populations in Catatumbo, Maracaibo, and Lake Valencia watershed. The Lowland Tapir has the broadest geographic distribution of the four living species of tapirs and the species occurs in 21 different biomes in eleven countries. Historically, this species was found east of the Andes and north of the Espinal grasslands and shrublands of Argentina , throughout the Chaco , Pantanal, Cerrado, Llanos, Caatinga, Atlantic Forest, and Amazonian/Orinoco biomes. The historic distribution of the species covered approximately 13,129,874 km*. Nevertheless, populations have been severely reduced and are currently often limited to forested biomes and wetlands. The species is believed to have gone extinct in approximately 14% ofits range and the current distribution declined to 11,232,018 km*. The species has been extirpated from the dry inter-Andean valleys of the northern Andes and is becoming increasingly rare along the agricultural frontiers that are sweeping through parts of the western and southern Amazon basin. In Brazil , which constitutes a large portion of its range, the Lowland Tapir has disappeared from over one million km? (12-4% of its countrywide range). Although only about 15-20% of the Amazon has been deforested in the past 30 years, 85-90% of the Atlantic Forest has disappeared and 40% of the Pantanal has been converted to human use. Most of the Cerrado and Caatinga biomes in Brazil have been converted to agriculture and cattle ranching. As a consequence, the Lowland Tapir has been extirpated from the Caatinga; most populations in the Cerrado are small and in protected areas where illegal hunting is minimal. Some exceptions include remote areas of Cerrado (e.g. Chapada das Mangabeiras, Jalapao region in Tocantins State ) where tapirs are still common. The Lowland Tapir is now either completely absent or severely fragmented across much of its historic range, with the Northern and Central Amazon as well as the remaining Pantanal ( Bolivia , Brazil , and Paraguay ) becoming important strongholds as southern, eastern, and north-western populations are declining rapidly. The IUCN Red Lust published in 1996 listed Lowland Tapirs as Lower Risk/Near Threatened. Therefore, the species has deteriorated in Red List status over a period of twelve years. There is an ongoing reduction of Lowland Tapir populations estimated to be slightly greater than 30% in the past three generations (33 years). This rate of decline is predicted to continue for the next three generations. The main identified threats responsible for the decline include habitat deforestation and/or alteration; habitat fragmentation (resulting in small populations and low connectivity); hunting; cattle ranching; infectious diseases; road-kill; fire; human density; plantations of monocultures (sugar cane, soy bean); lack of patrolling of protected areas; small size of protected areas; resource extraction; and impact of tourism. Hunting is one of the most important threats. Tapirs are among the preferred game species for subsistence and commercial hunters throughout the Amazon. Estimates of tapir harvest in the State of Loreto in the Peruvian Amazon range from 15,447 to 17,886 individuals per year. Due to their individualistic lifestyle, low reproductive rate, long generation time, and low population density Lowland Tapirs rarely achieve high local abundance, which makes them highly susceptible to overhunting, and populations show rapid decline when harvested. There are a number of infectious diseases (Bluetongue, Equine Encephalitis, Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis, and Leptospirosis) and parasites known in Lowland Tapir populations in the Atlantic Forest and Pantanal biomes in Brazil . These diseases spread to tapirs from domestic livestock, particularly cattle and horses, and can potentially increase tapir mortality and affect reproductive rates. Another serious threat to this species is road-kill. Morro do Diabo State Park in Sao Paulo , Brazil , is crossed by a highway that, from 1996 to 2006, killed an average of six tapirs per year. Most of the tapirs killed were adult individuals capable of breeding. Road-kill is also a serious threat in the Cerrado and Pantanal biomes of Brazil . Estimates of the total population size for the species throughoutits entire range are not available. This species occurs in numerous protected areas across its range. However a large proportion of the total Lowland Tapir population is found outside the boundaries of legally protected areas, where tapirs are hunted, chased by dogs, and face many other threats. Although the species is protected legally in most countries, hunting laws are seldom enforced and have proven ineffective.",Affonso (1998) | Aquino et al.

Overall, Central American Tapirs prefer habitat types with permanent water bodies, diverse and dense understory, riparian vegetation, low incidence offires, and less hunting pressure and human presence. Some studies in Mexico have noted that Central American Tapirs prefer densely forested areas rather than open, more disturbed habitats. In the mixed deciduous forest of Santa Rosa National Park in the north-west of Costa Rica , the tapirs relied on small pools of water in dried-up riverbeds for their drinking and wallowing requirements. Much of the habitat there was subclimax forest. In Corcovado National Park, also in Costa Rica , tapir sign (tracks, dung, rubbings, and evidence of foraging) was more abundant in lowland, second-growth forests and palm swamps than mature forests. In fact, tapirs in Corcovado strongly selected secondary forests and avoided mature forests. Seasonal variations in habitat selection correlated with fruit availability were observed. Tapir sign in Corcovado showed positive correlation with distance from perennial water bodies and rain intensity; there was a negative correlation between sign and slope steepness. Central American Tapirs have been observed in the Costa Rican paramos, particularly near ponds surrounded by dense bush of Chusquea . Lacking a dense hair coat like that of the Mountain Tapir, an extraordinarily thick skin and subcutaneous fat deposits probably help Central American Tapirs withstand the low temperatures prevailing in the paramos. In La Sepultura Biosphere Reserve, Mexico , tapir sign has been observed along mountain crests at 1000-1500 m. These mountain crests are often covered by strips of oak forest, which are believed to be used by tapirs as both marking sites and transit areas between tropical subdeciduous and montane cloud forest slopes.","The Central American Tapir selectively consumes a wide array of fruit, leaves, shoots, bark, and flowers. Long-term direct observations of one Central American Tapir in Corcovado National Park, Costa Rica , revealed that these animals consume an average of 15-63 kg of fruit and fibrous materials per day. The tapir observed consumed 126 different plant species. The percentages of bites taken of each food item during the study were 67% leaves, 18:6% fruits, 11-7% stems, 2-1% bark, and 0-1% flowers. Three species accounted for 40% ofthe tapir’s bites for the entire study. The information available on feeding habits of Central American Tapirs in Mexico comes from a few studies in which about 98 plant species of 50 families were recorded as consumed by this ungulate. The plant families most frequently represented in the diet of Central American Tapirs in Mexico are Asteraceae , Fabaceae , Moraceae , Rubiaceae , and Solanaceae . A previous study carried out in a tropical lowland forest in Guatemala noted that 49 species of plants are consumed by tapirs, with three species representing the highest percentage of the diet. Asteraceae , Euphorbiaceae , and Rubiaceae were the most important plant families. In the lowland rainforests of Corcovado National Park, plant species of the families Arecaceae , Euphorbiaceae , Moraceae , and Rubiaceae accounted for 33% of total plant species in the tapirs’ diet. Asteraceae , Ericaceae , and Poaceae (especially Chusquea subtessellata ) seem to be the predominant plant families in the 3000 m high paramos of Chirripé National Park, Costa Rica . The most evident changes in proportions of food items ingested by Central American Tapirs throughout the year are those related to fruit consumption. Fruit usually constitutes a smaller proportion of the diet of Central American Tapirs compared to leaves and other fiber sources. Average fruit proportions found in their feces generally ranges from 7-1% to 18:6% in different areas. However, in Santa Rosa National Park, Costa Rica , some fecal samples consisted almost entirely of fruit pieces and tapirs there depended heavily on a wide range offruits (and fruit sizes) during the dry season. Fruit provides significant amounts of the nutrition and calories consumed by this ungulate. Palm swamps composed primarily of Raphia taedigera and Bactris balanoidea are regularly patrolled by the tapirs and other ungulates, White-lipped Peccaries (7ayassu pecari) in particular, in search of fruit. The role of Central American Tapirs in seed dispersal and seed predation is not completely understood but studies in Santa Rosa demonstrated that they widely dispersed viable seeds of many species in their dung, including seeds incidentally ingested while browsing. In Guatemala and Mexico , Central American Tapirs appear to be important dispersers of Manilkara zapota seeds.","Most information about reproduction of Central American Tapirs in the wild comes from a long-term field study carried out in Corcovado National Park, Costa Rica . Direct and indirect evidence from this study indicates that they are facultatively polygamous. Adult female tapirs usually produce a single offspring after a lengthy gestation period of 13-14 months (390-410 days). Twin births are very rare. The calf stays with its mother for 12-18 months. An adult female Central American Tapir was monitored in Corcovado for approximately 14 years. During this period, this female produced nine offspring at intervals of approximately 18 months. Reports from zoos and field observations for wild tapirs in Corcovado indicate that females may become pregnant while lactating, which can reduce the interbirth interval to 16 months. Some females may lose their offspring during lactation, or due to stillbirths or neonatal deaths, and come into estrus sooner, therefore reducing the interbirth interval. Lastly, veterinarians who were part of the field team in Corcovado found pregnant females who had month-old calves; the females were one month pregnant, the fetus visible on ultrasound. Thus, it is highly probable that tapirs present a “foal heat” similar to horses, coming into estrus immediately after giving birth and able to get pregnant. The AZA Studbook for Central American Tapirs notes that tapirs in captivity sire their first offspring as young as two years old. A Central American Tapir Population and Habitat Viability Assessment (PHVA) Workshop held in 2005 modelled the dynamics of populations in the wild. Because conditions are assumed to be harsher in the wild than in captivity, the age of first reproduction was estimated to be three years, and maximum age of reproduction 20 years, for both females and males. Thus, the generation length of wild Central American Tapirs was estimated to be eleven years. Although field data from Corcovado shows a larger —although not significant— percentage of males, there is no evidence to suggest a skewed sex ratio at birth.","Central American Tapirs are substantially more active nocturnally than during the day. Their main peaks of activity are between 19:00 h and 20:00 h and 03:00 h and 04:00 h. In Santa Rosa National Park, tapirs were often active for short periods during the day, particularly in the dry season, when they entered residual pools in riverbeds to rest. However, tapirs are known to become almost completely nocturnal when there is heavy hunting pressure.",,"CITES Appendix I. Classified as Endangered on The IUCN Red List. Historically, Central American Tapir had a continuous distribution from south-eastern Mexico to the northern portion of Colombia (west of the Cauca River) to the Gulf of Guayaquil in Ecuador . The historic distribution ofthis species covered 1,186,300 km®. High rates of habitat destruction and fragmentation throughoutits former range have resulted in the current tapir distribution, which is mostly restricted to protected and/or remote areas in eight countries. A recent range extension of 377 km brought Central American Tapir to a new northern limit; La Tuza de Monroy, near the municipality of Santiago Jamiltepec in Oaxaca , Mexico . In Colombia , the species is present in Los Katios National Park. This population is poorly understood due to the presence of guerrilla activity, which has made research in the area extremely difficult. Anecdotally, biologists in Los Katios report that there are a few tapirs between the park and the Pacific Ocean. Large fragments of forest extending to the Pacific, combined with the Darien region , which is shared with the Republic of Panama , could have 160 km ? of habitat for a total of 227 km ?There is an ongoing reduction of Central American Tapir populations estimated to be greater than 30% in the past three generations (33 years). The low reproductive rates and slow population growth oftapirs, coupled with habitat loss/fragmentation and hunting, are the main factors contributing to population declines. It is estimated that approximately 70% of Central American forests have been lost through deforestation and alteration over the last 40 years. In Costa Rica alone, it is now estimated that 80% of the country has been deforested, up from about 67% approximately 25 years ago. Overall, it is inferred that at least 50% of the Central American Tapir habitat has been lost in the past three generations, causing drastic population declines and making remnant populations more susceptible to extinction from natural disasters and disease. This rate of decline is predicted to continue. In Belize , unremitting forest destruction and fragmentation of the Selva Maya continues to threaten tapir populations. The construction of roads through the Maya Biosphere Reserve in Guatemala is likely to become a major problem for tapirs in that area, as well as the isolation of smaller protected areas. In Costa Rica , logging and destructive farming practices are widespread. Gold mining is another problem in some parts of this country. The effect of hunting is notable given that Central American Tapirs are common where not hunted and nearly absent where hunting pressure is high. Even minimal hunting has proven to significantly decrease their populations, which is expected given their low reproductive rate. Some evidence exists that tapirs are susceptible and have been exposed to pathogens that also cause disease in livestock and horses; however, to date, there is no proof that infectious diseases have caused significant mortalities or have affected population levels. Nevertheless, several adult tapirs have been found dead nearlivestock areas in Chimalapas rain forest, Mexico , and were thought to have died from infectious diseases. Although most Central American Tapir populations have not been quantified and monitored yet, the current overall population estimate for this species is approximately 5000 mature individuals ( Mexico , 1000; Belize , no current estimates; Guatemala , 1000; Honduras , 500; Nicaragua , 500; Costa Rica , 1000; Panama , 1000; Colombia , 250). There appear to be several strongholds for tapir populations, including La Amistad International Park in Costa Rica and Panama . The Selva Maya shared by Belize , Guatemala , and Mexico is the largest continuoustract of forest where Central American Tapirs can be found. Recent surveys in the Cordillera de Talamanca, Costa Rica , found tapirs to be among the most abundant large vertebrates above 2000 m elevation, where large populationsstill remain in areas where they are not hunted. In the Republic of Panama , reports suggest that tapirs are distributed continuously along the forests of the Caribbean slope. Their range extends from Bocas del Toro Province in western Panama throughout the Panama Canal watershed to the Kuna Yala Comarca. These reports also confirmed their presence along the Cordillera Central in western Panama , including prime habitat above 3000 m ,as well as in the Darien region near the Colombian border. The Mosquitia area of Honduras and Nicaragua is particularly important because of its large size and low human population density. The species is believed to have been extirpated from El Salvador , but there are recent sightings and reports suggesting the speciesstill persists there at some level. Central American Tapirs occur in a number of protected areas throughout their range. Six large Biosphere Reserves in Campeche , Chiapas , and Quintana Roo in Mexico are thought to hold numerous tapirs. In Guatemala , the Maya and Sierra de las Minas Biosphere Reserves could hold several hundred more individuals, as could some other small parks in Belize , Honduras , Nicaragua , Costa Rica , and Panama . Although the species is protected nationally throughout its range, these laws are often not enforced in many areas.",Barongi (1986 | 1993) | Bolanos & Naranjo (2001) | Brooks et al.

In the Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary in Thailand tapirs range from 100 m to 1500 m in alttude, and in Sumatra, tapirs may reach an altitude of 1500 m , or possibly 2000 m when crossing a ridge. They are not found in northern Myanmar , northern Thailand , Laos , Vietnam , and Cambodia ,likely because of the more seasonal climate and harsher dry season of the forest in these areas. In Thailand , tapirs are associated with a variety of forest types including dry dipterocarp, mixed deciduous, dry evergreen, and hill evergreen. Tapirs move into evergreen forest during the dry season when food is scarce and forestfires are present. They return to the dry dipterocarp and mixed deciduous forest in the rainy season when sprouts of leaves and twigs emerge. Although Malayan Tapirs are generally considered to be lowland animals, they do travel a long way up mountains. In Indonesia , they inhabit lowland areas during the dry season and move to mountain areas during the wet season. Because the lowland forests are disappearing at a faster rate than the montane forests, an accelerated reduction in range and population is suspected. The Malayan Tapir habitat in Indonesia has been described as humid, swampy, densejungle with an understory of shrubby plants and grassy meadows bordering streams. In southern Sumatra , researchers found the highest densities of tapirs in undisturbed swamp areas and lowland forests on well-drained soil. The same researchers further stated that tapir densities were lower in early-stage successional forest than in late-stage successional forest that was formerly logged. Similarly, in the Jambi Province of southern Sumatra , a study showed that undisturbed areas were preferred over disturbed areas; however, signs of their presence were abundant in forest fringes as well as logged or otherwise disturbed forest, and sometimes these animals wandered into rubber and oil palm plantations. In Bengkulu , Sumatra , tapirs are considered to be a problem species for stripping bark from rubber trees. The Malaysian Department of Wildlife and National Parks (DWNP) inventories show that Malayan Tapirs are found within a 5 km radius of major cities like Seremban, Kuantan, and Temerloh. Another important aspect of their habitat use is that saltlicks apparently are visited once or twice a month, preferably with the new and the full moon. Malayan Tapirs generally stay in the vicinity of water. They like to spend a considerable time in the water and often defecate there. Several individuals have been rescued after falling into village wells or getting stuck in mud wallows.","Malayan Tapirs are selective browsers, concentrating their diet on young leaves and growing twigs. Preferred food plants mostly (42%) belong to the plant families Euphorbiaceae and Rubiaceae . Most of the plants consumed are woody and only a few herbaceous plants are consumed. In addition to foliage, Malayan Tapirs consume considerable amounts of fruit that they pick up from the ground. During feeding they sometimes push over small trees and break smaller sapling stems and branches in orderto get to the leaves and twigs. The heights at which they break stems were found to range between 0-8 m and 1-4 m. Feeding is not concentrated in particular locations. Suitable leaves and fruits appear to be eaten as encountered. Whereasit was reported by one source that their preferred food plants are characteristic of forest fringe and secondary growth, another source stated that the only feeding signs were found on understory plants in the primary rainforest. More than 115 species of plants are known to be eaten by Malayan Tapirs. Approximately 75% of these plants comprised 27 species and these are considered to be the most highly preferred food items. In Thailand , 39 species of plants were preferred. Their diet comprised 86-5% leaves, 8:1% fruit, and 5-4% leaf/twig matter. The most common plant species consumed by Malayan Tapirs in Sumatra are Symplocos, and Asplenium, Artocarpus , and Durio are occasionally eaten in secondary forests. Some herbaceous plants (Curculigo latifolia) and low-growing succulents (Homalomena and Phyllagathis rotundifolia) are also consumed, as is club moss (Selaginella willdenonii). The saplings of Baccaurea parviflora are browsed heavily.","There is very little data about the reproduction of Malayan Tapirs in the wild. Adult females usually produce a single offspring after a gestation period of 13-14 months (390-410 days). In May 2007, a female held at the Malay Tapir Conservation Centre (MTCC) at the Sungai Dusun Wildlife Reserve in Malaysia gave birth to twin calves, one male and one female. This was the first recorded twinning in the species. To model the dynamics of Malayan Tapir populations in the wild, data from captivity have been used to estimate reproductive parameters. Captive females return to a cyclic estrus during lactation, but allow males to mount 153 days, on average, after giving birth. Mating was once observed in a captive pair on five consecutive occasions, averaging 29-4 days (range 29-31) between copulations, suggesting interestrous intervals of about 30 days. The earliest known mating ages are three years for males and average 2-8 (range 2-3-3) years for females. The earliest recorded conception by a female Malayan Tapir, at Saint Louis Zoo in the USA , occurred at 36 months, although females have mated as early as 31-32 months of age. The life span is about 30 years. A Malayan Tapir Population and Habitat Viability Assessment (PHVA) Workshop held in 2003 modelled the dynamics of Malayan Tapir populations in the wild. Considering that natural situations impose a toll on growth and achieving sexual maturity, it was assumed that in the wild both sexes are capable of reproducing for the first time at age five. Maximum age of reproduction in the wild was estimated to be 24 (+ 2) years for both sexes. The generation length of wild Malayan Tapirs was estimated to be twelve years. A female Malayan Tapir could potentially bring up some 5-15 young in her lifetime. Zoo records from the Zoo Negara, Malaysia , show birth rates with a 1:1 sex ratio.","A Malayan Tapir camera-trap study in Way Kambas National Park, Sumatra , Indonesia , found the tapirs to be strictly nocturnal, with an activity pattern that peaks at 19:00 h, when their only possible predator, the Sumatran Tiger, is least active. A more recent camera-trap study in the Taratak village, West Sumatra , noted an activity peak at 22:00 h. Tapirs studied in Taman Negara in Malaysia were observed to browse occasionally during the daytime hours but were mostly encountered atrest.",,"CITES Appendix I. Classified as Endangered on The IUCN Red List. The species previously was listed as occurring in northern India , southern China , southern Cambodia , and possibly southern Vietnam . There was an authenticsounding record from Laos in 1902. Further investigation of historical records and other indications from Laos , Vietnam , Cambodia , northern Thailand , and even southern China have found none that has any compelling evidence in its support. There is no credible historical-era record from north of the Thai-Malay Peninsula, although there are fossil remains from Vietnam and China that indicate a much wider range under different climatic scenarios. In Thailand , Malayan Tapirs are found along the western border, on the peninsula south to the Malaysian border, and in Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary in the north. In Myanmar , the species is found restricted to the Tenasserim region, a narrow strip of territory between Thailand and the Indian Ocean.The speciesis listed as Endangered due to an ongoing population decline caused by habitat loss and fragmentation and increasing hunting pressure throughout its range. Malayan Tapirs are shy animals and appear to be highly sensitive to forest fragmentation. Population declines were estimated to have been greater than 50% in the past three generations (36 years), driven primarily by large-scale conversion of habitat to palm oil plantations and other human land-use. The rate of reduction in population is inferred to be proportional to the reduction of the tropical rainforest area in South-east Asia over the same period; however, it may be higher due to indirect threats. The population on the island of Sumatra , Indonesia , historically the main stronghold of the species,is considered to be the most endangered because of largescale habitat destruction. Approximately 60% of the forest cover of Sumatra has been lost over the past 15 years. As a consequence, more than 50% of the Malayan Tapir habitat is thought to have been lost, with much of the remaining forest either outside of protected areas or outside of the range of the species. Even in the protected areas, illegal logging continues. Less than 10% of the suitable habitat has been preserved, and much of that is degraded. In Thailand , remaining populations are isolated in protected areas and forest fragments, which are mostly discontinuous and offer little opportunity for genetic exchange. In Malaysia , forest loss is extremely severe, especially because of expanding oil palm plantations. Nevertheless, the current forestry trend seems to have stabilized at approximately 43% remaining forest cover (57% lost), of which at least half can be considered tapir habitat. In Myanmar , 3-2% of the land is protected and most tapir habitat lies outside of these protected areas. Although hunting has been a minor threat to the species in the past, it seems to be increasing as people are beginning to see the Malayan Tapir as a food source. Historically, tapirs were not hunted for subsistence or commercial trade in Thailand or Myanmar , since their flesh was considered distasteful, and some hill tribes believed that killing a tapir brings bad luck, so they are not hunted. However, some recent localized hunting has been reported in Sumatra . Nevertheless, it is uncertain how many individuals are actually hunted every year. Hunting could become a cause for concern, as already reduced and isolated populations would be at great risk for extirpation. Another problem is the removal of tapirs for zoos in Indonesia . In the past, several Indonesian zoos, especially Pekanbaru Zoo, traded in live tapirs for sale to other Indonesian zoos or private collections, or for sale as meat in local markets to the non-Muslim community. Fifty tapirs are reported to have passed through the Pekanbaru Zoo since 1993. Some of these animals are suspected of having originated from protected areas. Lastly, there have been reports of tapir road-kills in Malaysia . Further research efforts are needed to determine the total population size of Malayan Tapirs. In 2008, the population in Malaysia was estimated to be approximately 1500-2000 individuals. The speciesis legally protected in all range states and the habitat of large parts of the range is protected, including a number of National Parks in Thailand , Myanmar , Peninsular Malaysia , and Sumatra. Thailand supports one of the most comprehensive systems of protected areas in South-east Asia, comprising 17% of land area. Malayan Tapirs are recorded from forest areas in the west and south of the country, including transboundary forests in border areas and large isolated forest remnants. The transboundary forests represent the most extensive contiguous habitats for large mammals left in the country. They include the Western Forest Complex (Thai-Myanmar border), which includes twelve protected areas and covers over 18,730 km ?, including both dry and wet forests, and the Kaeng Krachan/Chumpol complex, which covers 4373 km ? mostly wet evergreen forest on the Thai-Myanmar border. The Balahala Forest is an expanse of 1850 km ? of tropical rainforest on the Thai-Malay border. All areas are contiguous with large forest areas on opposite sides of the border. Recent survey efforts suggest that tapirs are present though uncommon in each of these transboundary forest areas. Thus, most existing Malayan Tapir habitat in Thailand is protected and the future for conservation of the species in that country is positive. In Myanmar , Malayan Tapirs are entirely restricted to rainforests in the Tenasserim Ranges along the Thai-Myanmar border. Two new protected areas have been designated in the Tenasserims, Tanintharyi National Park and Lenya River Wildlife Sanctuary. If these areas can be protected, they will preserve valuable tapir habitat in the future. Currently, civil unrest in Myanmar makes these areas inaccessible for wildlife surveys.",Abdul Ghani (2009) | Barongi (1986 | 1993) | Blouch (1984) | Brooks et al.

Mountain Tapirs rarely use open habitats (pampas), in spite of the considerable quantity and quality of food available. In Los Nevados National Park, Colombia , Mountain Tapirs selected secondary forests, avoided paramos and ecotones, and showed no preference for or against mature forests. Their density in secondary forests was higher than in mature forest, ecotones, and paramos. Bedding sites are frequently encountered in forest thickets. In areas with cattle, the tapirs tend to be found on steep, forested mountain slopes inaccessible to cattle.","Mountain Tapirs are classified as selective browsers according to their craniodental patterns and dental morphology. The Mountain Tapir diet includes a variety of understory plant species including herbs, grasses, shrubs, fruits and berries, twigs, and a predominance ofleaves. A field study in Ecuador showed that of 28 plant families, Asteraceae ranked highest in the number of different species eaten, followed in diminishing order by Gramineae , Rosaceae , Cyperaceae , Fabaceae , Scrophulareaceae, and Valerianaceae . The same study indicated that Mountain Tapirs select certain favored plants regardless of their relative abundance. Flower parts were noted in five out of 37 fecal samples. A more recentfield study in Colombia showed that a total of 109 species of plants were consumed, and 45 of them were strongly selected. Mountain Tapirs consumed 54% woody species, 30% herbs, and 16% grasses. Once again, Asteraceae was the most frequent family in the Mountain Tapir diet. Patches of Chusquea make up a high proportion of secondary forest vegetation in Los Nevados National Park and make up a large part of the tapirs’ diet. The Mountain Tapir uses the sensitive bristles on the tip of its proboscis, as well as its senses of smell, taste, and, to a lesser degree,sight in selecting palatable items. Like other tropical species living in areas of high rainfall, the Mountain Tapir depends upon supplementary mineral intake from mineral seeps and natural saltlicks. Additionally, Mountain Tapir occasionally eat certain types of clayish mud, according to native Puruhaes Indians.",There is virtually no information about reproduction of Mountain Tapirs in the wild. Adult females produce a single offspring after a gestation period of 13-14 months (390-410 days). Twin births have never been recorded. Estrus lasts 3—4 days and is on a lunar cycle. A Mountain Tapir Population and Habitat Viability Assessment (PHVA) Workshop held in 2004 modelled the dynamics of mountain tapir populations in the wild. The age of first reproduction was estimated to be three years for females and four years for males. Maximum age of reproduction was estimated to be 15 (+ 3) years for both sexes. The generation length of wild Mountain Tapirs was estimated to be eleven years. Male Mountain Tapirs are reported to engage in violent confrontations over females.,"Daily activity of Mountain Tapirs in Los Nevados National Park, Colombia , was clearly bimodal, with peaks in the early hours of the day (05:00-07:00 h) and early hours of the evening (18:00-20:00 h). In the cloud forests and wet paramos of Ecuador , the activity of a young Mountain Tapir was higher during the morning (07:00-09:00 h) and late afternoon /evening (15:00-21:00 h). Increased nocturnal activity may be witnessed in areas with a greater presence of humans and livestock. In Colombia ,it has been hypothesized that the Mountain Tapir is more active at higher elevations (i.e. paramos and the upper limit of montane forests) during the dry season; during the wet season, activity increases at lower elevations. Apparently, domestic livestock management activities during the dry season at lower elevations forces the tapirs to move to paramos. A camera-trap study carried out in Los Nevados National Park revealed higher Mountain Tapir nighttime activity along trails and at a natural lick during the full moon.",,"CITES Appendix I. Classified as Endangered on The [UCN Red List. In Colombia , it occurs in the central Andes, south of Los Nevados National Park, and in the eastern Andes, south of Paramo de Sumapaz, near Bogota . There are no Mountain Tapirs in the Western Cordillera, northern part of the Central and Eastern Cordilleras, Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, Serrania de la Macarena, and Cerro Tacarcuna. Nevertheless, there are reports of their presence (footprints, feces, and poaching remains) in the junction of the Central and Eastern Cordilleras of Colombia . In Ecuador , Mountain Tapirs are found in the eastern Andes, including Sangay National Park, Llanganates National Park, Podocarpus National Park, and Cayambe Coca Ecological Reserve. In Peru , the species is distributed from the Ayabaca province, Piura Department ( 04° 20 ° S) in the Western Cordillera to the Chota Province, Cajamarca Department ( 06° 20 ° S) in the Eastern Cordillera. In the southern part of the distribution in Peru , the species occurs in the Huancabamba depression, which includes the Tabaconas-Namballe National Sanctuary and the Pagaibamba Protection Forest. Historically, the species has been recorded in Venezuela , in the vicinities of El Tama National Park, opposite the north Santander State of Colombia . However, there is no recent evidence ofits occurrence in the area. The most threatened populations are those of the Central Cordillera in Colombia , between Parque Natural Las Hermosas and Parque Natural Nevado del Huila , where large tracts of mature montane forests are being converted to opium fields. The Mountain Tapir is now extinct in much of its former range. The major threat to the Mountain Tapir throughoutits range is human population growth in the Andean region. People settling in the region need land, consumables, and services, and their activities lead to habitat destruction. Mountain Tapir population declines have been estimated to be greater than 50% in the past three generations (33 years). It has been predicted that that there will be a decline of at least 20% in the next two generations (22 years). The low reproductive rates and slow population growth characteristic of tapir species, coupled with habitat loss and fragmentation and hunting, are the major factors contributing to population declines. Habitat fragmentation is caused by conversion of forests and paramosto cattle ranching and agricultural lands. There is significant hunting pressure on this species. It is extremely rare to encounter an area with Mountain Tapirs where they are not being overhunted. Local poachers use the tapir skin to manufacture working tools (e.g. backpacks, ropes to ride horses, baskets) and domestic artifacts such as carpets and covers for beds. In addition, poachers sell tapir skins and feet for medicinal purposes. Additional threats include the development of hydroelectric dams, highways crossing protected areas, petroleum exploration, and electrical networks. Road construction is a major threat in Puracé National Park, Colombia . There has also been widespread cattle introduction into the last remaining patches of Mountain Tapir habitat, which leads to competition for food resources and a potential risk of transmission of infectious diseases and other etiological agents carried by the cattle. Cattle have been observed forming reproducing herds in western Sangay National Park in Ecuador , causing Mountain Tapirs to abandon areas north of Sangay Volcano. Information from other areas where the species is found (Cayambe Coca Ecological Reserve in Ecuador , Tabaconas-Namballe National Sanctuary in Peru , and Natural Parks in Colombia ) indicates that the same problem with cattle is occurring there, too, and negatively affecting the species. Other threats include cattle roundups, which can result in increased hunting of the tapirs; poppy growing and eradication; and guerilla warfare in Colombia . The presence of guerillas may benefit the tapirs by halting settlement of some areas, but most local biologists feel that the overall impact on the conservation of Mountain Tapirs is negative. In addition, a mining project in northern Peru threatens to destroy the headwater cloud forest and paramo habitat of a scant population of Mountain Tapirs. It has been estimated that fewer than 2500 mature individuals still remain in the wild. The Mountain Tapir population in Peru has been estimated to be approximately 450 individuals. There is no connectivity between the northern and southern Mountain Tapir populations in Peru . The area of suitable habitat for the Mountain Tapir inside National Parks in Colombia is 13% ofthe total area where tapirsare still found. In the Andes of Colombia , there are 23 National Parks, of which tapirs are found in only seven (Cordillera de los Picachos, Cueva de los Guacharos, Las Hermosas, Los Nevados, Nevado del Huila , Puracé, and Sumapaz).

Have been sighted within 0-5° of North Pole.",,"Arctic ice provides a necessary platform for hunting seals. Annual ice adjacent to coastlines (shore fast ice) regularly fractures, providing open leads where seals can breathe. The seasonal fluctuations between freezing and open water also promotes high productivity of fish, the prey of seals. Thus, this habitat is preferred by seals, and is consequently a favored habitat for Polar Bears, which hunt seals along the ice cracks and edges. Polar Bears also hunt from large chunks of drifting ice, and to a lesser extent, multiannual pack ice, where seal density is lower and access to seals more difficult. For this reason, density of Polar Bearsis low close to the North Pole. In summer, when the ice retreats, bears either migrate northward or use nearshore terrestrial habitats. Parturient females stay ashore to den and give birth. In Hudson Bay ( Canada ) they den 10-80 km inland in peat banks; elsewhere maternity dens are typically in snow caves along coastal areas. However, in the Beaufort Sea, half the pregnant females den on drifting sea ice. Non-pregnant bears do not hibernate, but do use shelter dens. At lower latitudes, they use shelters on land during ice-free periods to escape heat and conserve energy when precluded from hunting seals; at high latitudes (above 75° N ) they seek shelters on thick sea ice during winter, when foraging is most difficult and weather conditions harshest.","Almoststrictly carnivorous, preying mainly on young Ringed Seals (Pusa hispida), to a lesser extent Bearded Seals (Erignathus barbatus), and in some areas, Harp Seals (Pagophilus groenlandicus). The principal focus on Ringed Seals is evident in the close association between Polar Bear density and Ringed Seal density, and in the unique behavior of these seals, which give birth in subnivian lairs as an anti-predation strategy. One study found that an average Polar Bear consumes fewer than 50 Ringed Seals a year, 80% being pups caught either in their lairs or shortly after emerging from their lairs. Polar Bears also occasionally prey on other marine mammals, such as Walruses (Odobenus rosmarus), and Beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) whales. These large prey, including Bearded Seals (which are much larger than Ringed Seals), are taken mainly by adult male bears. When ashore, depending on availability, Polar Bears have been observed to prey on Reindeer (Rangifer tarandus), seabirds, or fish; and eat carrion (dead whales), berries, vegetation, and human garbage.","Breeding occurs from March to June. Mating induces ovulation, and males spar for mating partners. Implantation of the fertilized egg is delayed until autumn, about the time that females enter maternity dens. In some areas this follows a period of on-shore fasting, so by the time these mothers emerge from dens the following spring they may not have eaten for eight months. Birthing occurs mid-November to January, so the total gestation, including the period of delayed implantation, is from 6:5 to more than 8-5 months. Cubs stay in the den until March or early April. Two-cublitters are most common, and average litter size is less than two in virtually all populations; however, litters of three are not uncommon in some areas, and litters of four have been reported. Females have only four mammae (other bears, except Sun Bears and Giant Pandas have six), so this is the maximum litter size. Average age offirst birthing ranges among different populations from 4-6-7-2 years. Productivity increases into the teen years, but then declines through the early 20s, and ceases by the late 20s. Intervals between litters average 2-1-3-6 years. Cubs separate from their mother either at 17 months, or more commonly a year later. Cubs may nurse through their second birthday. The fat content of milk is very high initially (more than 30%), but declines through the nursing period.","Appear to be mainly diurnal. Seasonal changes in activity vary regionally with dynamics of sea ice and abundance of prey. Activity, measured by percent of time active and distance moved,is elevated when seal pups are particularly naive and vulnerable to predation, and when older seals are molting and basking on the ice. In contrast to other predators, Polar Bears are most active when prey is most abundant. They become hyperphagic, and are able to store fat to withstand extended periods when foraging is more difficult, such as during the winter on the pack ice. Periods of rapid annual ice formation and ablation, during summer and fall, also result in greater activity. Parturient females den for about six months (mid-September to mid-March in most areas); non-pregnant Polar Bears do not hibernate.",,"CITES Appendix II. In 2006 The IUCN Red List status was upgraded to Vulnerable due to projections of dramatic reductions in habitat (coverage and stability of the ice sheet) over the next 50-100 years. Demographic consequences to Polar Bears are already becoming apparent in some areas, in terms of reduced numbers and reduced survival ofjuveniles and old adults. Ringed Seals are also suffering increased mortality from Polar Bear predation because of melting of their subnivian dens. Accordingly, the USA listed the species as nationally threatened and Canada listed it as a species of special concern. This would impose further constraints on activities that affect these bears or their habitat, such as hunting, recreational viewing, shipping, and oil and gas exploration and development. The effects of sea ice change will vary enormously by region, which is difficult to forecast, but overall arelikely to be dramatic and permanent. Nineteen fairly discrete populations have been identified, with a total world population estimated at 20,000-25,000; about half this number resides in the Canadian territory of Nunavut . Under an agreement for co-management of Polar Bear populations that was ratified in 1976, the five range countries coordinate and consult with each other on research activities, methods of population estimation and monitoring, and proposals for increased protection. Most importantly, under this treaty, harvestis restricted: the taking of cubs or females with cubs is prohibited, and harvest is limited to native people for subsistence use. This includes consumption of meat, use of hides for clothing, and creation of handicrafts. In some territories of Canada , a portion of the annual harvest is allocated to non-native sport hunters who employ native guides and hunt using dogsleds and other traditional methods. This generates income for the native communities. Harvests are regulated to be sustainable. Recently, pressure has mounted to reduce or prohibit harvests so as not to compound the effects of diminishing sea ice habitat from global warming.",Amstrup (2003) | Amstrup & Gardner (1994) | Amstrup et al.

Their range overlaps that of both the American and Asiatic Black Bear, and also slightly that of the Polar Bear. They exist at elevations from sea level (temperate rainforests and Arctic tundra) to well above treeline (dry Asian steppes); highest elevation sightings (tracks in snow) have been at 5500 m (possibly 5800 m ) in the Himalayas, and highest latitude sightings at 74° N ( Canada ), well into Polar Bear range.","Food habits vary regionally from principally herbivorous to principally carnivorous, depending on habitat. Plant foods include grasses, sedges, horsetails, forbs, roots, berries, and nuts. Animal foods include insects, rodents, ungulates, and fish. Insects are a significant dietary component in broadleaved forests of Europe, rodents and ungulates are most important in Arctic and alpine areas and some Boreal forests, and fish are paramount along the Pacific Coast, from British Columbia to Alaska to Kamchatka ( Russia ). Herbaceous vegetation tends to be the chief component of the spring diet. Later the bears switch to roots, berries, pine nuts, acorns, ants, bees, moths, ground squirrels, marmots, pikas, neonate ungulates, or spawning salmon, depending on availability. This species is morphologically and behaviorally well adapted to digging up insects and underground rodents,killing ungulates (including domestic species, like sheep and cattle), and catching salmon. In North America they rarely climb trees, whereas in Europe and parts of Asia they do so more regularly.","Mating is promiscuous, and generally occurs from mid-May to mid-July. Within individual populations, the breeding period in any given yearis narrower, typically about one month. Estrus can be as brief as one day to as long as a month, and male-female pairings can last from just a few hoursto three weeks. Copulation generally lasts 10-40 minutes, and induces ovulation. Implantation of the blastocyst is delayed until six to eight weeks prior to birthing, which usually occurs in January or February, while the mother is hibernating in a secluded den. Food conditions, especially the proportion of meat (particularly salmon) in the diet, largely affect reproductive rates. Average age offirst birthing varies among populations from fourto ten years, and average litter size varies from 1-3-2-5 cubs. Maximum littersize is five. Inter-birth intervals are as short as two years in some European populations, more typically three years and sometimes more than four years in North America, and averages 5-7 years in a high altitude population in Pakistan . Extended litter intervals result from mothers spending extra time to raise cubs in poorer habitats. Offspring generally remain with the mother until she breeds; however, where inter-birth intervals are greatly extended, mothers may recoup for a year or more without offspring. Females continue to produce cubs until their mid to late 20s, but may live another ten years after that.","Active diurnally in North America, except where human activity is high. Nocturnally active in most of Europe, possibly due to more frequent contact with humans, both historically and presently. Young bears in Europe are active uniformly through the day, but apparently learn to become more nocturnal through negative experiences with people. Total time active per day (40-80%) varies with local conditions (food, day length). The period of hibernation also varies regionally: at the northern extremes of their range they may hibernate for seven months (October-May); conversely, on Kodiak Island, Alaska, where winters are mild and some food may remain available, about one-quarter of the males do not den all winter, an unusual anomaly among Brown Bears. In Russia , following seasons with very poor food, large numbers of malnourished bears may wander about for much of the winter.",,"Only populations in central Asia ( Mongolia to the Himalayas, China , Nepal , Bhutan ) fall under CITES Appendix I; all others are CITES Appendix II. The species as a whole is not considered threatened by The IUCN Red List (Least Concern), but some individual European populations are separately red-listed (Vulnerable-Critically Endangered), and other threatened populations will be added in the near future. These small populations tend to exist in remnant wild areas surrounded by more extensive human development, which act as mortality sinks. Forty-seven countries in North America, Europe, and Asia are inhabited by Brown Bears. During the past 500 years they have been extirpated from 17 other countries, including large parts of Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, and Mexico . In the lower 48 states of the USA , they were exterminated from more than 98% of their original range within 100 years of the arrival of European settlers, and have not since recovered. The total world population is estimated to exceed 200,000. Fairly reliable population estimates exist for several areas in North America ( USA 33,000; Canada 25,000) and Europe (14,000, excluding Russia ), but for few areas in Asia. Russia has the largest number of Brown Bears, believed to exceed 100,000. The species is relatively abundant in more northern parts of its distribution, but smaller, fragmented populations exist farther south. Populations are sufficiently large to sustain legal hunting in Russia , several former Soviet Republics, Japan ( Hokkaido Island), Canada , Alaska ( USA ), and several European countries. Conversely, populations with fewer than 100 individuals exist along the USA-Canadian border and in southern Europe where several small, isolated populations persist: two in the Pyrenees ( France and Spain ), one with less than 10 bears and the other with about 20, two populations in the Cantabrian Mountains ( Spain ) containing 20-30 and 80-100 bears, a population in the Appenine Mountains ( Italy ) with 40-50 bears, and in the the Alps ( Italy , Austria , and Slovenia ) with 35-40 bears. Small, disconnected populations are also scattered across southern Asia, and in some areas even the present existence of this species is unknown ( Bhutan , Iraq ). As wide-ranging omnivores, Brown Bears are attracted to areas with human-related foods, where they may threaten life and damage property (livestock, cropfields) and may be killed as a consequence. Small numbers of mortalities, especially adult females, can threaten the viability of small, isolated populations. Most small populations are legally protected by national laws and international agreements, but with varying degrees of enforcement. Moreover, even where hunting is banned, other sorts of human-caused mortality (management removals, self-defense, malicious killing, poaching, mistaken hunting of Black Bear) dominate the population dynamics of these bears. Reintroductions and population augmentations have helped to restore numbers and expand geographic range in the USA and Western Europe. Numerous protected areas around the world have Brown Bears, but few are large enough to support a self-sustaining population; therefore, Brown Bear conservation must be integrated with many other human land-uses.",Bellemain | Nawaz et al.

In Borneo, Sumatra, and peninsular Malaysia , areas with high rainfall throughout the year, they inhabit mainly tropical evergreen dipterocarp rainforest and peat swamps. They also use mangrove forest and oil palm plantations in proximity to other, more favored habitats. They occur from near sea level to over 2100 m elevation, but are most common in lower elevation forests.","Omnivorous diet includes insects (over 100 species, mainly termites, ants, beetles and bees), honey, and a wide variety of fruits. In Bornean forests, fruits of the families Moraceae (figs), Burseraceae and Myrtaceae make up more than 50% of the fruit diet, but consumption of fruits from at least 20 other families of trees and lianas were identified in just one small study site ( 100 km ?) in East Kalimantan. Availability of foods varies markedly from masting years when most species fruit synchronously, to inter-masting years when little fruit is available and the bears turn mainly to insects. Figs ( Ficus ) are a staple food during inter-mast periods. On the mainland, fruiting is more uniform (predictable) from year to year, but varies seasonally. However, there is an enormous diversity of fruits, so some fruit is available at all times of year. In Thailand , about 40 families of trees are climbed by Sun Bears, mostly for food; fruits from Lauraceae (cinnamon) and Fagaceae (oak) are favorites. Sun Bears are especially known for preying on colonies of stingless bees (7Trigona), including their resinous nesting material. The bees form nests in cavities of live trees, so to prey on them Sun Bears chew and claw through the tree, leaving a conspicuous hole. These bears consume little vegetative matter, although they seem to relish the growth shoots of palm trees (palm hearts), the consumption of which kills the tree. Occasionally they also take reptiles, small mammals, and bird eggs.","This is the only species of bear without an obvious breeding and birthing season. Cubs are born during all months, both in captivity and in the wild. However, data have not been collected across the range, so it is possible that greater reproductive seasonality occurs in areas with strongly seasonal environments. Females have four teats, but maximum observed litter size is two, and normal litter size is only one. Captive-born cubs have shown an unusual female bias. The gestation period in captivity is much shorter than in other bears: it is normally 3-3-5 months (indicating a shortened or nonexistent period of delayed implantation), but in a few odd cases stretched to 6-8 months, like most other bears. Mating in captivity occurs at 3-6 month intervals if pregnancy does not result. If cubs die, estrus reoccurs in 2-5 weeks, making the interbirth interval as short as 4-4-5 months. No information is available on normal cub dependency or intervals between litters in the wild. The earliest known age of estrus in the wild is three years old. Birthing takes place in a secluded den. In captivity, mothers sometimes carry their cub in their mouth, suggesting that bears in the wild may be able to move dens occasionally after the cub is born.","Activity has been described as mainly nocturnal or mainly diurnal. This variability depends on proximity to human activities: in heavily disturbed areas, such as oil palm plantations, Sun Bears are chiefly nocturnal. Camera traps along roads typically obtain photographs of bears mainly at night, whereas signals from radio-collared bears farther from roads indicate that they are active mainly during the day. They spend a large proportion of time feeding in trees when fruit is abundant. They also sometimes build tree nests of branches and leaves for sleeping. This behavior has been attributed to previous predation pressure by Tigers; however,it appears to occur commonly only in heavily-disturbed forests or near people. Sun Bears have been observed to slide rapidly down tree trunks when disturbed by people. Although arboreally adept, they cannot swing orjump from tree to tree. Normally they sleep on the ground, often in cavities of either standing or fallen trees, or under such trees. Females use similar sites for birthing dens. This species does not hibernate.",,"CITES Appendix I. Listed as Vulnerable on The IUCN Red List. Although quantitative estimates of population sizes and trends are lacking, rates of habitat loss and degradation, combined with persistent poaching, indicate that the global population ofthis species has declined by more than 30% during the past three decades. Additionally, it is strictly protected under national wildlife laws throughout its range; however, there is generally insufficient enforcement of these laws. None of the eleven countries where the Sun Bear occurs has implemented any conservation measures specifically for this species. Commercial poaching, especially for gall bladders (used in traditional Chinese medicine) and paws (a delicacy), is a considerable threat, especially in mainland South-east Asia. Local hunters in one area of Thailand estimated that commercial poaching reduced the abundance of Sun Bears by 50% in 20 years. In Malaysia and Indonesia , deforestation is the prime threat. Clear-cutting to expand oil palm (Elaeis guineenis) plantations (which is likely to worsen with increased biofuel production) and unsustainable logging (both legal and illegal) are escalating at alarming rates. Prolonged droughts, spurring natural and human-caused fires, are compounding the habitat-loss problem, resulting in diminished availability of food and space for bears, sometimes causing their starvation. Where bears do not die directly from food scarcity, they seek out agricultural crops adjacent to the forest, and are poisoned or trapped and killed by local people. Some headway has been made in establishing buffer zones around protected forested areas, educating local people on nonlethal deterrents, and increasing communication between local people and sanctuary managers, resulting in shared problem solving.",Augeri (2005) | Fredriksson (2005) | Fredriksson | Danielsen & Swenson (2007) | Fredriksson | Steinmetz et al.

Preferred habitat includes various sorts of humid and very humid montane cloud forest. They also occupy higher elevation elfin forest, and puna and paramo (high-altitude) grasslands, as well as lower elevation thorn forest and scrub desert (in western Peru ).","Omnivorous diet includes many kinds of fruits, vegetative material, and meat. Especially important through most parts of the range are the succulent parts of plants in the family Bromeliaceae , both epiphytic and terrestrial bromeliads. In high altitude grasslands, the heart of the terrestrial Puya is a dietary mainstay, as this bromeliad is the only abundant food available for much of the year. The bears must strip away the stiff thorny leaves to get to the heart, which looks somewhat like a pineapple but is vegetative and bland. Bears may eat only one in ten of this obiquitous plant, possibly related to differences in nutritional composition. In the forest, they regularly climb trees to obtain Tillandsia , an epiphytic bromeliad; they eat the basal meristematic tissue and drop the remaining pieces of leaves to the forest floor, providing a highly visible sign of their feeding activity. Bears select patches (with Puya ) or trees (with Tillandsia ) that have a high density of large bromeliads. Bromeliads compose from 90% to less than 15% of their diet, depending on season and geographic area. Fruits compose the other core part of the diet, varying inversely to the bromeliads. Both shrub and tree-borne fruits are consumed (e.g. Lauraceae , Moraceae , Ericaceae , Euphorbiaceae ). Fruit abundance varies seasonally with rainfall. Other foods include palm petioles, bamboo shoots, bulbs of orchids, and in drier habitats, fruits and pulp of cacti and, remarkably, the soft cortex of the pasallo tree (Bombax discolor). Near human settlements, they routinely raid cornfields. Animal matter is another potentially important food, although never a large dietary component. They eat insects, snails, and small mammals, but more significantly in terms of total nutrition, they occasionally take large mammals such as deer and free-ranging or unguarded pastured cattle. Considerable controversy has surrounded the issue of whether most meat in their diet is from animals that they killed or scavenged—there is clear evidence that they sometimes prey on cattle, but they probably also find carrion. A test of their attraction to beef demonstrated this: a small (0-5 kg) chunk of meat placed in an open area attracted two different radio-collared bears from a distance of 1-5 km in 5-15 hours. When feeding on a cattle carcass, which may take several days to consume, they often construct ground and tree nests for resting. Tree nests are made from a collection of bent and broken branches. They also sometimes build nests in fruit trees.","Presumed mating pairs have been seen between March and October; however, no real information is available on the normal timing of breeding of wild Andean Bears. In captivity in the Northern Hemisphere, births occur from December through February, coinciding with the timing of births in northern species of bears. However, in zoos in South America, Andean Bear births tend to occur more regularly during May-October. Anecdotal information on probable birthing dates in the wild is equivocal. Gestation periods in captivity range from 5-5-8-5 months, indicating a variable period of delayed implantation, and litter size is most commonly two. Litters in the wild are commonly one or two (but up to three or four). Females can produce cubs at two-year intervals, beginning at 4-7 years of age.","In one high-elevation site in Bolivia , composed of mixed grassland and cloud forest, Andean Bears were entirely diurnal. They slept 9-12 hours at night, awoke near sunrise, took brief rests during the day, and began their night's rest just after sunset. This pattern did not vary seasonally. In other areas, bears are reported to be somewhat more active at night, but are still principally diurnal. Because food is available year-round throughout their range, Andean Bears do not hibernate.",,"CITES Appendix I. Listed as Vulnerable on The IUCN Red List. Andean Bears are also protected by national legislation in each of the five range countries. However, loopholes in these laws and lack of adequate enforcement result in bears being killed while depredating crops or livestock, or poached for their parts. Andean Bear products are used for medicinal or ritual purposes, and live bears are also sometimes captured and sold. These problems are exacerbated by habitat loss and fragmentation, which not only reduces their natural foraging area, but also puts the bears in closer proximity to people, crops, and livestock. In a few select areas, management plans have been established, with community involvement, to ameliorate bear-human conflicts. A survey in 1998 revealed that less than 20% of the range was legally protected as parks, reserves or sanctuaries. Since then, additional protected areas have been created and others enlarged, but at the same time, more forested land outside the protected areas has been lost to agriculture or fragmented by road development, and mining activities. Some conservation organizations are working to maintain or establish corridors among populations, especially in the northern part of the range, where many Andean Bear populations are isolated in small to mediumsized patches. Habitat patches are larger in the southern part of the range ( Peru , Bolivia ). Valid rangewide or country-wide population estimates are lacking; guesstimates range from about 13,000-25,000. Efforts are underway to survey various parts of the range to obtain information on presence-absence and relative abundance, based on incidence of sign (bear trails, climbed or rubbed trees, tree nests, bed sites, feeding remains, scats).",Cuesta et al.

C China ( Sichuan , Gansu & Shaanxi Provinces).",,"Occupy temperate montane forests with dense stands of bamboo at altitudes of 1200-4100m, or more typically 1500-3000m. Bamboo is a dominant understory plant in broad-leaved, broad-leaved mixed with conifer, and subalpine conifer forests in the mountainous regions of central China . However, the type and density of bamboo greatly affect habitat use by Giant Pandas. The growth rate of bamboo, and hence its suitability to Pandas,is also related to the amount of overstory tree canopy. Remaining habitat for Pandas is steep and rugged, being the only land that was not farmed and settled by people in a once-extensive range that extended from Beijing to eastern China and south to present day Vietnam and Myanmar . Within this remaining habitat, Pandas seek areas with relatively gentle slopes and high moisture.","Their diet is almost entirely bamboo (over 99%); however, they occasionally feed on leaves, stems or roots of other plants as well as some meat, from rodents and young ungulates, either killed or scavenged. During large-scale flowering and die-off of bamboo, individuals may seek other foods, including crops and human garbage. For unknown reasons, some individuals do this even when bamboo is readily available. Across the six mountain ranges that they inhabit, Giant Pandas utilize over 60 species of bamboo, 35 of which constitute their main food source. They select species higher in protein and lower in fiber, hence more digestible. They use different species of bamboo in different elevational bands, varying with the seasons and coinciding with the germination and growth of the plants. They eat different parts of bamboo at different times of year, alternating between young tender leaves and shoots, versus stems and branches. They prefer shoots and stems of certain lengths and diameters, selecting those that are easier to hold and chew. Pandas sit or recline to eat. Holding a stem in one paw, a Panda inserts it in the side of its mouth and repeatedly and rapidly bites off chunks approximately the width of its palate, chewing very little. Scats of any individual Panda thus have intact fragments of bamboo that are all approximately the same length. This characteristic has been exploited in population surveys, where the size of bamboo fragments in scats is used to differentiate individuals with overlapping home ranges.","Mating occurs from March through May. Vocalizations (bleating, chirping) and scent marking are used to attract mates. Pairs may remain together for days or weeks prior to mating. Both sexes may mate with multiple (3-5) partners. Peak estrus lasts less than one week. Females use rock dens or hollow trees for birthing. Cubs are born in August or September, 3-5-5 months after mating; a variable period of delayed implantation accounts for the variability in total gestation. At 80-200 grams, the infant at birth is only about 0-1% of the mother’s weight, one-third to one-quarter that of other bears. Infants are born pink in color, with short, sparse white hair; the typical black and white pelage is achieved by three weeks of age. Litter size at birth is often two, generally born about two hours (but up to 36 hours) apart; however, the mother raises just the first born, if it is healthy. Thus, functional litter size in the wild is only one. In captivity, females can be fooled into raising two cubs by switching them every twelve hours. This is the only species of bear to regularly give birth to more cubs than it can raise—the explanation for this unusual reproductive strategy remains elusive. Also, unusual for bears, Panda mothers change dens multiple times, carrying their cub in their mouth, and also periodically leave the den to feed. During the birthing process they only fast for 2-3 weeks. Pandas are often erroneously believed to be poor breeders. This impression stemmed from the previous low reproductive performance of captive animals, now known to have resulted from inadequate captive conditions. Studies of wild Pandas indicate that their reproductive rates are comparable to some other species of bears, with cub production beginning at 5-7 years and inter-litter intervals of two or three years. Breeding continues into the early-20s, so a female could wean six or more cubs in her lifetime.","Pandas are active about 50% of the day, mostly collecting or eating bamboo. Activity occurs rather uniformly through the day and night, in bursts of a few hours. Little variation occurs seasonally. Unlike other bears, which exhibit an energymaximizing strategy, increasing consumption and activity when food is most plentiful, Pandas are least active when feeding on abundant and nutritious leaves. Because food is available throughout the year, Pandas do not hibernate, although during cold and snowy conditions they may take temporary shelter in hollow trees, rock crevices, and caves. They climb trees, although infrequently, to escape danger, to rest, or in courtship—during the mating season males may vocalize from trees to attract females, and estrous females may climb to fend off suitors. However, they spend less time in trees than several other species of bears (Andean Bears, Sun Bears, Asiatic Black Bears) because they do not feed there.",,"CITES Appendix I. Listed as Endangered on The IUCN Red List. The Giant Panda is considered a threatened and precious species in China . They are also listed as Endangered under the USA Endangered Species Act, thereby regulating import of captive animals into the USA . Their total population in the wild has been estimated at less than 2000, but this may be revised as better methodology is developed for estimating numbers (e.g. using DNA in their feces to identify individuals). They are a Category I species (maximum level of protection) under the Chinese Wildlife Conservation Law. A national conservation plan, adopted by the Chinese government in 1992, guides conservation initiatives for this species. Intentional poaching of Pandas has been largely curtailed by severe penalties and increased patrolling in their remaining habitats. Markets for their skins have virtually disappeared, and other body parts are not used in traditional Chinese medicine. However, they are still sometimes killed in snares set for Musk Deer and other species. Limited and degraded habitat remains their greatest threat. The species only exists in portions of six mountain ranges separated by expanses of agriculture, and within these, inhabitable bamboo forests are separated by a patchwork of clearings and forested areas without bamboo. Conservation measures have included the establishment of a network of more than 60 Panda reserves, a ban on logging, and a policy that compensates farmers who convert agricultural fields on steep slopes to forest. However, small population size and restricted total range remains a threat to the viability of this species. A further threat relates to the panda’s reliance on bamboo for food. Bamboo is subject to periodic, synchronous flowering and dieoffs at intervals of 15-120 years, and the fragmented habitat restricts where Pandas can move when such die-offs occur. Effects of climate change on bamboo abundance and flowering cycles are as yet very uncertain. Captive breeding in China has now succeeded (with the aid of artificial insemination) to the extent that captive facilities will soon be overpopulated, providing a potential stock for augmenting wild Panda populations. However, the lack of suitable release sites—having adequate habitat but few resident pandas—Ilimits hopes of eventually releasing many of these captive Pandas into the wild.",Endo et al.

They inhabit areas as diverse as dry Mexican scrub forests, Louisiana swamps, Alaskan rainforests, and Labrador tundra (where they occupy the typical niche of the Grizzly Bear). They tend to occupy more forested habitats than the Grizzly Bear, especially where the two species are sympatric. Elevationally they range from sea level to 3000 m , and up to 3500 m for winter denning.","American Black Bears are generalist, opportunistic omnivores with diets varying seasonally from herbaceous vegetation (mainly in spring) to roots, buds, numerous kinds of fleshy fruits, nuts, insects in life stages from egg to adult, and vertebrates from fish to mammals, including their own kills as well as carrion. They are also attracted to human-related foods, including garbage, birdseed, corn, oats, apples, honey and brood in apiaries. Feeding increases dramatically in the fall, in preparation for hibernation, and focuses on foods rich in fat. American chestnuts ( Castanea dentata) were once a key fall food in eastern North America, but after blight destroyed this food source in the early to mid-1900s, oak ( Quercus ) acorns and beechnuts ( Fagus grandifolia) became the main fall foods. Farther west, hazelnuts (Corylus), whitebark pine nuts (Pinus albicaulis), madrone ( Arbutus xalapensis), mansanita ( Arctostaphylos ), huckleberries ( Vaccinium ), and buffalo berries (Shepherdia canadensis) are principalfall foods. In arid regions, succulents such as yucca and cacti are important, especially during droughts.","Mating typically occurs from mid-May to July, but may extend longer, especially in more southerly regions. Copulation induces ovulation. Males locate females by scent. Estrous females actively attract males by scent marking. Both sexes travel widely during the breeding season, and adult males may significantly reduce foraging. Testosterone levels are elevated in breeding males, which increases aggression. Access to females is governed by a male dominance hierarchy and male-male interactions; the extent of fighting among males varies among populations, and is related to density and sex ratios. Male-female breeding pairs may remain together for several days and copulate multiple times. Both sexes breed with multiple partners, but a small proportion of breeding males actually sire offspring. Implantation of the blastocyst occurs in November and birthing in January or February (occasionally December) while the mother is hibernating. Cubs are born highly altricial, weighing 200-450 g, 20 cm in length, eyes closed and nearly hairless. Females give birth beginning at age 3-8 years, depending on food availability and hence their growth rate, and can produce cubs every other year until their mid-to-late 20s. Mothers and cubs leave the birthing den when cubs are 2-:5-3-5 months old. They readily climb trees as a refuge when the mother is off feeding, sometimes several kilometers away. They nurse until autumn, but increasingly consume wild foods beginning in late spring. They den with their mother over their first birthday, and remain with her for 16-17 months. Family breakup is usually instigated by the mother’s breeding activity. Where food is less abundant, the interbirth interval may be prolonged to three or more years, enabling a period of recovery without cubs. Litter sizes range from 1-5, averaging 2-5 cubs in eastern North America and 2-0 in western North America, and tend to be slightly male-biased.","Mainly diurnal, commonly with an early morning and evening peak in activity and a lull in midday. They tend to sleep through the night, but nocturnal activity may increase during fall, especially in places with clumped, abundant foods. It has been theorized that gut capacity and passage rates of food may limit the length of feeding bouts when intake rates are high, prompting more uniform feeding throughout the day. Alternately, or additionally, large weight gains in fall may pose energetic constraints on feeding. More nocturnal activity also occurs when feeding in areas near human activity. Total time active per day averages 50-60%, but may be less when abundant human-related foods are available. Virtually no activity occurs for the 3-7 months of winter hibernation. In some southern portions of the range, where food is available year-round, only parturient females and those with cubs from the previous year hibernate.",,"Not globally threatened, listed as Least Concern by The IUCN Red Lust, but is listed on Appendix II of CITES under the similarity of appearance provision; this mandates tagging of exported parts legally taken by hunters, so they cannot be confused with parts from illegally taken bears ofother species. With a total population estimated at about 900,000, American Black Bears are more than twice as abundant as all other species of bears combined, even though they exist in only three countries in North America ( Canada , USA , Mexico ). Continent-wide, numbers appear to be increasing by about 2% per year, and more than 60% of USA states and Canadian provinces report increasing populations. Approximately 40,000-50,000 are harvested annually by sport hunters in 28 USA states and twelve Canadian provinces and territories. In Mexico , no hunting is allowed, and the species is considered nationally endangered, but appears to be increasing and expanding its range. The Louisiana subspecies (luteolus) was listed as threatened under the USA Endangered Species Act because of severe loss and fragmentation of its habitat combined with unsustainable human-caused mortality. U. a. floridanusis listed as threatened by the state ofFlorida.

Most of range coincides with forest, especially forests with hard mast (oak or beech), but is also found in regenerating forests with berries and cultivated plantations. This species also occupies arid subtropical thorn-forests (southern Iran and Pakistan ) and seasonally uses alpine meadows. In tropical South-east Asia, Asiatic Black Bears inhabit both evergreen and deciduous forests, virtually the same as the Sun Bear, except Sun Bears rarely reach into montane habitats (above 1200 m ).","Foods often include succulent vegetation (shoots, roots, forbs and leaves) in spring, insects and a variety of tree and shrub-borne fruits in summer, and nuts (hard mast) in autumn. In some areas, mammalian ungulates (especially smallbodied species) may compose a sizeable portion of the diet; however, these bears rarely eat fish. Asiatic Black Bears regularly climb trees to obtain fruits, because most fruits in their range are tree-borne. In tropical regions fruit diversity is especially high. For example, in Thailand their diet includes over 80 species of tree-borne fruits, commonly including those in the cinnamon ( Lauraceae ), pea-bean (Leguminosae), mahogany ( Meliaceae ), and oak-beech-chestnut ( Fagaceae ) families. In temperate regions, where they must store fat for hibernation, hard mast, such as oak acorns, beechnuts, walnuts, chestnuts, hazelnuts, and pine nuts, is a key fall dietary component. When feeding in hard mast trees they often break branches inward toward the trunk and pile them up in the canopy forming a platform or “nest” upon which they sit. When natural forest foods are lacking, they feed in agricultural fields (corn, oats, millet, barley, buckwheat) and fruit orchards. In plantations, when food supplies are short, they strip bark and eat cambium of conifer trees, damaging the trees.","Breeding generally occurs duringJune—July and birthing during November— March; however, timing of reproduction is not known for all portions of the range, especially in the tropics. The full gestation period of 6-8 months includes 4-6 months of delayed implantation. Age offirst reproduction is typically 4-5 years for both sexes. Modallitter size is two cubs (range 1-3, rarely four), but the average is less than two, produced at most every two years.","Active diurnally most of the year, often with peak activity periods in morning and evening. More uniformly active, day and night, during the fall, when foods are clumped and abundant. Overall level of activity may vary seasonally, but is generally in the range of 50-60% over a 24hour period. In northern latitudes, where food becomes unavailable in winter, both sexes hibernate. They typically den November—April, but some remain in dens until the end of May (which is later than other species of bears). In the tropics, except for females giving birth during the winter, Asiatic Black Bears generally do not hibernate.",,"CITES Appendix I. Listed as Vulnerable on The IUCN Red List. The so-called Baluchistan Bear (U. t. gedrosianus), living in south-eastern Iran , and southern Pakistan , is listed as Endangered under the USA Endangered Species Act. Reliable population estimates do not exist anywhere in the range; however, two of 18 range countries estimate total populations of less than 100 ( Iran , South Korea ), whereas at the other extreme, three countries estimate populations of 5000-15,000 ( India , Japan , Russia ) and one ( China ) estimates more than 20,000 Asiatic Black Bears. Most countries report declining populations due to habitat loss and poaching. Habitat loss from logging, agriculture, human settlements, roadways, and erosion is most severe in southern portions of the range. The species is protected throughout its range by national and international laws. Sport hunting for Asiatic Black Bears is legal only in Japan and Russia , with annual harvests of about 500 and 100 bears, respectively; however, illegalkills and nuisance kills exceed hunting kills by a factor of five or more in both countries. Bear depredations on crops and apiaries, and attacks on people, have increased throughout the range, and have led to more direct killing, using guns, poisons, and bombs that explode when bitten. Poaching also appears to be increasing, spurred by commercial demands for meat,skins, paws, and gall bladders. The demand for these products has fueled a growing network of international trade throughout South-east Asia, and has encouraged many subsistence hunters to turn to commercial hunting. Paws are sold as an expensive delicacy (made into a soup), especially in China . Bile in gall bladdersis dried and sold as a traditional Chinese medicine; it has been used as such for nearly 3000 years. To supply an increasing demand, bear farms have been established in China and Vietnam , where bile is drained from over 12,000 Asiatic Black Bears and sold commercially. This technique was originally developed in North Korea in the 1970s, and “perfected” over the years in China . Some officials assert that the increased production of bile from farming reduces poaching of wild bears; conversely, the cheaper and more available farmed bile also may encourage more use, and thus ultimately more demand for wild bile, which is considered more potent. Farmed bile is now produced in such surplus that it is incorporated into many non-traditional Chinese medicine products, such as shampoos, lotions, cosmetics, sports drinks, and toothpaste. Prompted by animal welfare-related concerns, several hundred bears have been removed from farms and taken to rescue facilities run by non-governmental organizations. However, the large total number of captive, non-releasable bears and the opinion of government officials that farming aids in the conservation of wild bears, make the situation rather intractable.",Bromlei (1965) | Carr et al.

Densities are highest in alluvial grasslands, and second-highest in moist or dry deciduous forests. Characteristically a lowland species, mainly limited to habitats below 1500 m , but ranges up to 2000 m in the forests of the Western Ghats, India . In Sri Lanka ,it inhabits dry monsoon forests below 300 m . The climate throughout the range is monsoonal, with pronounced wet and dry seasons. This causes some variation in food habits and habitat use: very dry or very wet conditions can hamper feeding on termite colonies.","Sloth Bears are both myrmecophagous and frugivorous. Ants, termites, and fruit dominate their diet, with proportions varying seasonally and regionally. Fruits (from at least ten families of trees and shrubs) constitute up to 90% of the diet during the fruiting season in southern India and 70% in Sri Lanka , but less than 40% in Nepal , where fewerfruits are available. Sloth Bears more often eat fallen fruits off the ground than climb to eatfruits in trees. However, they will readily climb to consume honey. During the non-fruiting season, insects make up 95% of the diet in Nepal and 75-80% in S India and Sri Lanka . The relative proportion of termites to ants in the diet also varies considerably by region; in Nepal and Sri Lanka this ratio 1s more than 2:1, whereas in central India the ratio varies from about 1:1 to 1:5, favoring ants. Sloth Bears feed on termites by digging into their mounds or underground colonies, then alternately sucking up the termites and blowing away debris. These distinctive “vacuuming” sounds can be heard from 200 m away. Although most of their diggings are less than 60 cm deep, they occasionally dig down 1-2 m. Sloth Bears typically eat little vegetative matter other than fruits and some flowers, and they rarely prey on mammals or eat carrion. However, where their habitat is severely degraded by intensive human use and most of their normal foods are not available, they feed heavily on cultivated fruits and agricultural crops such as peanuts, corn, potatoes, and yams.","Mating generally occurs from May to July. Males congregate near estrous females and fight for mating access. Females mate with multiple (often 3) males in the order of their established dominance, related largely to weight, and males mate with multiple females. Male-female pairs mate multiple times over a period of one hour to 1-2 days; copulations last 2-15 minutes. Females generally remain in estrus for only two days, rarely up to one week. Cubs are born from November through January. The 4-7 month gestation includes a period of delayed implantation. The birthing season may be somewhat lengthened in Sri Lanka , although previous reports of cubs being born throughout the year have not been corroborated by recent studies. Cubs are born in dens, either natural caves or holes excavated by the mother, and emerge with their mother at 2-2-5 months of age. The most common littersize is two cubs, although in some populations litters of one are also common; it is not known whether the latter represents cub mortality shortly after birth or small litters at birth. Litters of three are rare. Females have trouble raising litters of three because they carry their cubs on their back, and the third cub, carried over the hips, may bounce off. The long hair near the mother’s shoulders is a preferred riding place because it provides a better grip for the cub. Cubs remain on the back even when the mother vigorously digs for termites in deep holes (more than 1 m ). Mothers with cubs on their back travel more slowly than bears without cubs. Cubs ride either head first or crosswise for 6-9 months (by which time they are each about one-third the mass of the mother), increasing their time on the ground as they age. When threatened, they scamper to their mother’s back for refuge rather than climbing a tree, probably an adaptation to living in an environment with few trees and formidable predators (Tigers), some predators that can climb trees (Leopards), and large animals that can knock over trees (elephants, rhinoceroses). Cubs nurse for 12-14 months, and remain with their mother for either 1-5 or 2-5 years, so litter intervals are either two or three years.","These bears are more nocturnal than other bears, likely a response to the heat and sparse cover of their environment. Overall amount of activity varies widely, from 40-70% of the 24hour day, depending on conditions. In a national park in Nepal , with dense cover and moderate temperatures, most Sloth Bears are active both day and night, but are more active at night; conversely, subadults and females with cubs are diurnal, possibly to avoid being killed by nocturnal predators (Tigers) and other bears. In a park in Sri Lanka , with higher temperatures but dense cover, the bears are similarly more active at night and show lowerlevels of activity during the day. Where cover is much sparser, Sloth Bears often remain in shelter dens, usually crevices among boulders in rocky hillocks, the whole day, becoming active only near sunset. In central India , average daytime temperatures immediately outside shelter dens under a patchy (less than 25%) tree canopy, average 39°C (up to 44°C) compared to 28°C inside the dens. In winter, pregnant females den to give birth, whereas males and non-pregnant females remain active. It is unclear whether denning females actually undergo physiological hibernation in terms of reduced metabolism, recycling of body wastes, and preservation of muscle mass; they do not have large fat supplies to sustain them,like hibernating bears of other species, but they manage to survive without eating or drinking for 2 months. About 2 weeks before emerging from birthing dens with their cubs, they make nightly excursions from the den to feed.",,"CITES Appendix I. Listed as Vulnerable on The IUCN Red List. Sloth Bears are also protected to varying degrees by national laws in all five range countries. However, they can be killed to protect life or property; this is not uncommon, given their aggressive nature and increasing numbers of encounters between bears and people, often resulting in human casualties. Although no reliable large-scale population estimates exist for this species, best guesstimates indicate about 20,000 or fewer animals rangewide. Substantial fragmentation and loss of habitat suggests that their population has declined by more than 30% over the past 30 years. The recent possible extirpation of Sloth Bears in Bangladesh highlights serious concerns over persistence of small, isolated Sloth Bear populations throughout their range. Populations appear to be reasonably secure inside protected areas, but are faced with deteriorating habitat and direct killing outside. About half to two-thirds of the Sloth Bears in India live outside protected areas, and half the occupied range in Sri Lanka is not protected. Habitat has been lost, degraded, and fragmented by overharvest of forest products (timber, fuelwood, fodder, fruits, honey), establishment of monoculture plantations (teak, eucalyptus), settlement of refugees, and expansion of agricultural areas, human settlements, and roads. Commercial trade in bear parts has been reported, but its current extent and impact on Sloth Bears is uncertain. Poaching also occurs for local use (e.g. male reproductive organs used as aphrodisiac; bones, teeth and claws used to ward off evil spirits; bear fat used for native medicine and hair regeneration). Capture of live cubs to raise as “dancing bears” remains a significant threat in some parts of India because laws against this are not adequately enforced. Some non-governmental organizations have been rescuing these bears (although they cannot be released to the wild) and training the people who hunted them in alternate types of work, in exchange for a commitment that they will not resume the practice.",Akhtar et al.

Okapis browse well over a hundred different species of plants of which twenty are favored, including Scaphopetalum dewevrei, Drypetes sp., and Diospyros bipendensis. They forage along well-trodden paths through the forests. They feed in small tree-fall gaps and on the edges of blowdowns. They browse by twining their long prehensile tongues around branchlets, stripping the leaves and pulling them into the mouth. They walk slowly, with a gait similar to that of the Giraffe’s, sampling leaves from right and left from palatable shrubs. They do not feed on herbaceous monocotyledons, some of which are important in the diets of chimpanzees (Pan spp.) and gorillas (Gorillaspp.), and they do not compete for browse with the relatively few other occupants of their forest biome. Duikers (Cephalophus spp.) and Water Chevrotains (Hyemoschus aquaticus) favor fallen fruits and seeds; Bongos (Tragelaphus eurycerus), African buffaloes (Syncerus spp.), sitatungas (Tragelaphus spp.), Giant Forest Hogs (Hylochoerus meinertzhageni), Bush Pigs (Potamochoerus porcus), and African Forest Elephants (Loxodonta cyclotis) all feed on foliage from canopy trees in sunlit clearings and swampy openings. Distribution of the Okapi’s food plants favors dispersed rather than congregated foraging. Nowhere is the forage abundant enough to support a herd, nor do the Okapis converge on seasonally-varying food sources, as there is continuous growth of new leaves. Females occupy forest areas that are richest in their favored food plants. There is a greater density of suitable browse in tree-fall gaps, as indicated by a change in locomotion of Okapi when feeding in gaps. When browsing in the subcanopy, their gait is steady, whereas when feeding in a tree-fall gap they walk more slowly, frequently pausing to feed on several plants from one position. Under the canopy and in gaps Okapis are selective browsers, eating only a small proportion of the species present and focussing on the youngest leaves. Food supply in the Ituri forest is patchy and variable in quality and distribution. Okapis exhibit geophagia, ingesting dirt in search of minerals.",,,,,Bodmer & Rabb (1992) | Colbert (1938) | Hart (1992 | 2001) | Hart & Hall (1996) | Hart | J.A. & Hart T.B.

It also lives in Mediterranean maquis scrub, in alpine summit meadows, and in the treeless moorlands of Scotland . It prefers broadleaved woodlands interspersed by large meadows. Up to 2800 m above sea level on the Alps. In west-central Asia it occurs in woody and shrubby thickets along riverbanks in desert areas.","As an intermediate feeder with a relatively large rumen,it tends to eat a mixed diet of about 30% grass and sedges and about 65% browse, without significant differences among seasons. Fruits and seeds are important items in autumn. It is a very versatile species, consuming up to 300 different species of plants. The two sexes tend to differ in diet composition, hinds eating higher quality food. Stags eat on average 14-16 kg and females around 9-10 kg offresh vegetation per day. Actual food intake follows appetite cycles related to photoperiod and hormones, which are highest in March—June and lowest in late September-December. Lactating hinds more than double their energy requirements.","In good quality habitats most females attain puberty at 16 months of age. In less productive habitats sexual maturity may be postponed by at least one year. Stags reach puberty at about 16 months, but can actually begin to reproduce at five years of age. Rutting season is in September—October. Females are polyestrous, with cycles of 18 days. During estrus they are receptive for only 6-24 hours. Conceptions are well synchronized, occurring for 80% of females within 3-4 weeks. Stags leave their summer quarters and move to their traditional rutting stands, where they try to collect and defend a harem against other stags. Competition among stags is high, with some failing completely to reproduce and others able to father up to a dozen or more calves in a season. Stags are involved in roaring contests, dominance displays, and overt fights, with a real risk of serious injury, or more rarely, death. During rut stags lose as much as 15-20% of their pre-rut weight and up to 80% of body fat. The mean length of gestation is 235 days. Before giving birth, hinds leave their group and move away from their usual core areas, looking for better cover. Calving season peaks in May-June. Hinds almost invariably give birth to one calf, which weighs on average 8-9 kg (about 6-5 kg in Scottish moorlands). Male calves are about 5% heavier than females. For the first 7-10 days calves are kept hidden, usually lying in tall vegetation, then begin to follow their mother. During the first few days calves are fed ten times a day. From five days to 90 days they are nursed eight times, and after that, four times a day. Lactating hinds produce 2-4 liters of milk per day, with a peak 50 days after parturition and a decline after three months. By 15-18 days of age calves have doubled their birth weight. They begin to ingest their first vegetation at ten days, and at one month they feed more regularly on plants. Weaning occurs at 6-9 months (November—February). Stags can typically breed for 3-5 years, peaking in Scotland at 7-10 years of age (possibly at 9-12 years in continental Europe). Hinds have a much longer reproductive life span, of up to 12-16 years. The sexes have also a differential pattern of body growth; stags do not reach their full body weight before 8-9 years of age, whereas hinds attain adult size at 3-6 years. Normally Western Red Deerlive to a maximum of 17-18 years, with records of 22 years for stags and 26 for hinds. Main predators are Gray Wolves (Canis lupus) and Eurasian Lynxes (Lynx lynx).","It is active all the day, with peaks at dawn and in early evening, alternating 6-8 periods of foraging, ruminating, resting, and moving from place to place. It dedicates 7-12 hours to feeding. Human disturbance increases nocturnal activity.",,"“Bukhara Red Deer” (bactrianus) CITES Annex I and Barbary Red Deer CITES Annex III. Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List (under C. elaphus complex), but it can be considered as not currently at risk and globally increasing. During the 18"" and the 19"" century overhunting with modern weapons resulted in a drastic contraction of the distribution range and abundance in most parts of Europe. Strict rules for culling, the enforcement of laws with precise hunting seasons, and reintroductions combined to produce an increase in range and numbers. This has become particularly evident since the 1950s-1960s. At the beginning of the 20"" century in the Italian Peninsula only a small population in the Po River delta (Mesola Wood) survived. Thanks to the natural recolonization from neighboring countries of the Alpine region and releases, in 1970 deer numbered 3000 individuals. The number grew to 41,000 in 2000 and 57,000 in 2005. In all of Europe, excluding Russia , Western Red Deer numbered 1-25 million individuals in 1985 and 2-4 million in 2005. The annual harvest grew in the same period from 270,000 to 500,000 individuals. Densities are normally 1-5 ind/km?, sometimes up to 15 ind/km?*; higher numbers often imply supplementary feeding. Densities are artificially raised to unnaturallevels (up to 100 ind/km?) to increase revenues from hunting. The Western Red Deeris extinct in Albania and in the Near East ( Lebanon , Israel , Jordan , Syria ). Four subspecies are still rare: the Thyrrenian Red Deer, the Barbary Red Deer, the Bukhara Red Deer, and the “Tarim Red Deer” (yarkandensis). Thyrrenian Red Deer faced a dramatic decline in the 20™ century, disappearing from Corsica in 1969 and decreasing to a minimum population size of 100 animals in Sardinia in 1970. Deforestation,fires, and poaching with guns and snares were the main causes. Red Deer from Sardinia have recovered slowly, numbering 6000 animals in 2005. In 1985 a reintroduction program was started in Corsica . Barbary Red Deer became extinct in Morocco by 1932, and in early 1960 only a few dozen animals survived in forests in the Atlas Mountains between Algeria and Tunisia . More effective protection allowed a recovery in Algeria and Tunisia , and in 1994 a reintroduction was begun in Morocco . The Bukhara Red Deer originally lived in the basins of the Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers. Tree felling, cattle grazing, and overhunting led to a rapid decline during the 19"" century. In early 1900 it disappeared from Syr Darya. In the mid-1960s the population reached a minimum of 350-400 animals; in the early 1980s it had grown to 1100. The Tarim Red Deer of Chinese Xinjiang had a declining population of 4000-5000 in 1991, scattered along the Tarim and Karakash rivers.",Apollonio et al. (2010) | Butzler (1986) | Carnevali et al.

Stags generally begin to compete for access to females when they are 4-5 years old. Rutting season peaks between September and October. Females have estrous cycles of 18-20 days and receptive periods of 12-36 hours. Stags may adopt different mating strategies; they can defend rutting territories, collect a harem, or enter the female range and pursue estrous hinds. Cases of lekking behavior have been reported in introduced populations in Central Europe. Rutting stags scar tree trunks, making vertical grooves; they thrash the ground and the vegetation and emit a quite distinctive call, a repeated high-pitched whistle. During rut stags lose 25% of their weight on average. The gestation length is generally 222-237 days and calving season peaks in May-June. Hinds give birth to a single calf weighing 3-7 kg on average, depending on the subspecies. At about ten days of age the calf begins to eat its first solid food. Lactation lasts about six months. Stags reach their full weight at about 6-8 years of age, hinds at 3-5 years. Normally they live a maximum of 15-16 years. In captivity they reach a maximum longevity of 25 years.

In Taiwan it became extinct in the wild in 1969; it was reintroduced with captive animals in 1988-1989 and is now stable. In Vietnam it is extinct in the wild and very rare in zoos and collections. In China there are a few small, scattered populations. According to one source there are fewer than 1000 Sika Deer in China and all populations are declining. Another survey gives a total of 8500 animals in eight provinces. The dramatic decline of the Sika Deer in continental Asia is a consequence of overhunting (for meat and hides, but also for antler velvet, blood, organs) and habitat loss. Three subspecies are possibly extinct in the wild: grassianus, mandarinus, and pseudoaxis.

But at least six other mating systems have been documented: temporary defense of stands, multiple stands (2-3 bucks in contiguous territories), leks (collective arenas with 5-25 bucks in symbolic display territories of few square meters), harem defense, multimale dominance groups (with the highest-ranking buck tolerating other males but achieving most matings) and following (pursuing single estrous does). Rutting bucks emit a series of repeated short groans up to exhaustion; they lose as much as 15-20% of their pre-rut weight. The gestation lenght is generally 229-234 days. Fawning season peaks in late May—early June. Does give birth to one fawn, weighing on average 4-5 kg; male offspring are about 10% heavier than females. After ten days the fawn accompanies its mother. Allosucking, i.e. mothers permitting fawns of other females to nurse, has been observed. Weaning occurs at 8-9 months of age. Bucks reach their full body weight at 5-6 years of age, and does attain final size at 3—4 years. Normally they live to a maximum of 15-16 years, with records of 20 years. Maximum longevity in captivity is 25 years of age.

Originally it was associated with early successional stages of the forest, young tracts of woods and scrubland. During the Neolithic Revolution, when a transition occurred from huntinggathering to agriculture and settlements, progressive forest fragmentation and the creation of wood clearings, meadows, and cultivated areas, gave Western Roe Deer new opportunities. The higher proportion of forest edge in the mosaic landscapes typical of traditional agriculture was particularly suitable to the species. Today Western Roe Deer occur in a wide variety of habitats, from the maquis scrub of the Mediterranean coast to the boreal forests of Scandinavia, and from Scottish moorlands to modern farmland with scarce cover. They live in the Alps up to 2400 m . Northern and north-eastern range limits seem to be largely determined by snow depth. The heavy foot loading and the low chest height makeit difficult to move in snow more than 40 cm deep.","Western Roe Deer are typical selective feeders or concentrate selectors, preferring soft food rich in soluble carbohydrates, proteins, and water. They have a relatively small rumen (4-6 1) and abomasum, and large salivary glands and liver; they are able to detoxify secondary plant metabolites. They are opportunistic and flexible deer, consuming up to 370 plant species at the regional level and about 1000 at the continental scale. Buds, shoots, and leaves of shrubs and deciduous trees, and green leaves and flowers of forbs (dicotyledon herbs) are particularly important; seeds and fruits are also eaten, especially in autumn. It seems that roe deer have physiological mechanisms that allow soluble carbohydrates to avoid microbial fermentation in the rumen and to be directly absorbed in the small intestine. With the onset of vegetation growth in spring, metabolic rate and food intake increase, reaching a peak during early lactation and the rutting period in summer; in winter basal metabolism and appetite decline. Daily food intake is 2—4 kg of fresh vegetation. Since roe deer have very scarce body reserves of fat, they need to obtain most nutrients directly from their food. This requires a greater tolerance for food of low nutritional quality, especially in winter, which is unusual for a browser. Special adaptations of the salivary glands make roe deer, unlike most herbivores, insensitive to toxic effects of high concentrations of tannins.","Females attain puberty at 14 months of age and normally begin to reproduce immediately. Males reach physiological maturity at the same age but generally begin to participate in reproduction only at 2-3 years of age. Mature spermatozoa are present from March to October, but the rutting season is restricted to mid-July-mid-August. Females are monestrous, becoming receptive only for 36-48 hours during mid-summer, without the possibility of being fertilized a second time. Adult bucks follow olfactory traces of does, evaluate their status using the vomeronasal organ, and, having spotted a receptive doe, begin a courtship pursuit. This consists initially of a long chase in large circles, then in close runs in small circles or figure eights. Bucks remain with a doe for 2—4 days, and then move to find other estrous does residing in the neighborhood. During rut bucks lose about 10% of their weight. Females can take an active role in mate selection by making excursions out of their home range,visiting a territory holder, and mating with him. Fertilization is followed by a five-month period of “embryonic diapause.” The fertilized ovum penetrates into the uterus without implanting in the endometrium, reaching a blastocyst stage 0-1 mm in diameter, resulting in a blastula 5 mm in diameter. Implantation of the embryo occurs in January. The true gestation period lasts about 150 days, with the birth season in May-June. Does give birth to 1-3 fawns; in most of Europe two is the rule, but in Scandinavia, where mothers are particularly heavy, triplets are common, and in Mediterranean habitats frequently only one fawn is produced. Newborn fawns weigh on average 1.3-1. 9 kg , doubling their mass by 10-15 days. During the first weeks they remain hidden and in case of danger they “freeze”; their mother eats and rests about 50-150 m away. They are fed 5-9 times a day during the first month, 2-4 times during the second, and 1-2 times during the third month. Lactation lasts about three months. They begin to ingest their first leaves at about ten days and feed completely on vegetation by early September. At one month they are active for 1-1-5 hours per day. At weaning they synchronize the rhythms of activity with those of their mother. At 7-8 months males begin to be slightly heavier than females. At 3—4 years, roe deer attain full adult size. At eight years they enter senescence. Normally they live to a maximum of 10-12 years, with records of 14 years for bucks and 18 years for does. In populations subjected to hunting, averagelife expectancy is less than three years. Gray Wolves (Canis lupus) and Eurasian Lynxes (Lynx lynx) are the main predators; foxes may prey on young fawns.","The small size of the stomach requires the deer to feed frequently, generally 9-11 times during a 24hour day. Roe deer are active all day, alternating periods of foraging, ruminating, resting, and moving. Feeding bouts at dawn and dusk have the longest duration.",,"Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. Presently the Western Roe Deer is the most common deer species in Europe, numbering about nine million head, of which 2-9 million are annually harvested. Densities are normally 5—=25 ind/km?, with maximums of 50-70 ind/km?. In the Near East it is extinct in Lebanon and Israel (where a reintroduction program was begun in 1997). During Mesolithic times in Europe it was probably less abundant than the Western Red Deer ( Cervus elaphus ), confined to thick woods, glades, and clearings. But habitat changes caused by humans give it new opportunities. During the Medieval and Renaissance periods, roe deer hunting generally was not restricted to nobles or reigning houses. Overhunting was responsible for a significant decline in the species across most of Europe between the 17"" century and the first half of the 20"" century. The reinforcement of laws, the recovery of natural habitats, and reintroductions, coupled with the extreme ecological flexibility of the Western Roe Deer and its high reproductive potential, made possible a recolonization of vast areas and an increase in density.

Males reach physiological sexual maturity at the same age, but in naturally structured populations yearling and subadults are excluded from breeding by dominant bulls and begin to reproduce only at five years of age; in heavily hunted populations with a low proportion of adults, subadults have a good chance of mating. Rutting season is in September—October. Typically an adult male locates and defends an estrous female until he mates with her, and then he moves on in search of other females (“tending bond mating system”). In tundra the dominant bull tends to herd and defend a group of females (“harem mating system”). Bulls thrash antlers on vegetation, rub trees, dig rutting pits, and urinate and wallow,salivating copiously. Females are polyestrous, with cycles on average of 24 days. During estrus they are receptive for 15-26 hours. Estrous females rub trees and visit rutting pits dug by males and wallow in them. Bulls lose 9-18% of their weight during the rut. Gestation lasts on average 234 days, with the birth season in May-June. Cows give birth to one or two calves, weighing on average 10-12 kg in Europe and 14-18 kg in Alaska ; their mass doubles in about two weeks. Mothers remain within 50 m of their offspring for 5-7 days. Calves are nursed 7-9 times during the first days and four times at about 50 days of age. At 2-3 weeks calves begin to ingest solid food and at one month, half of their diet consists mostly of plants. Lactation lasts about 4-5 months.

In the E Atlantic, historical records range S to Cintra Bay (23° N), Western Sahara.",,"Temperate waters of coastal regions, including shallow basins, areas over the continental shelf, and deeper areas over the continental slope. Availability of the copepod Calanus finmarchicus is considered an important factor in habitat suitability of North Atlantic Right Whales. Interestingly, although C. finmarchicus is dormant throughout the Gulf of Maine during winter, North Atlantic Right Whales apparently continue to prey on them at great depths in smaller regional basins. Young copepods develop during onset of the seasonal thermocline and the spring phytoplankton bloom into late-stage copepodites and adults by late spring. Data on prey species and oceanographic parameters have been used to model habitat suitability for North Atlantic Right Whales on a weekly timescale in Cape Cod Bay and Great South Channel of the North Atlantic Ocean, and they demonstrated that habitat use patterns change seasonally. Inclusion of prey as a variable was an important factor in model accuracy; presence of C. finmarchicus was most influential to habitat suitability in winter and spring. Such habitat modeling allows prediction of whale presence on a real-time basis and may be important to conservation efforts. During the birthing season in winter, pregnant females are often observed in relatively sheltered, shallow coastal regions in their southern distribution. For pregnant females, presence of prey may be a less important factor in habitat selection than winter oceanographic conditions. As in other mysticete species, there is some evidence of maternal habitat fidelity in North Atlantic Right Whales and indication of learned habitat selection. Offspring learn suitable habitat in the company of their mothers, returning to those habitats in subsequent years.","The North Atlantic Right Whale feeds mainly on calanoid copepods, most commonly C. finmarchicus. Documented prey items also include Pseudocalanus spp., Centropages spp., barnacle larvae, juvenile euphausiids, and a variety of nektonic plankton. The North Atlantic Right Whale is a skim feeder, swimming slowly with mouth open through densely concentrated swarms of prey, closing the mouth occasionally to flush out water. Feeding occurs at the water’s surface and, more frequently, deep below the surface. Feeding near the seafloor also apparently occurs occasionally. Generally, whales skimming with their mouths open at the surface, stop, closing their mouths, after having reached the end of a prey patch. Whales feeding at depth breath in c.10-15minute intervals, and thus their mouth-closing actions are more regular. Feeding dives commonly last c.10-20 minutes.","Some details of reproduction have been very well documented for the North Atlantic Right Whale, based on long-term studies using photo-identification of individuals. Long-term research over a period of several decades has shown fluctuation in its reproductive rate and birth intervals (time period between successive births for a single female). Birth intervals of North Atlantic Right Whales increased from an average of three years between births during the 1980s to more than five years by the late 1990s. Mean age of female maturity increased from approximately seven to nine years of age during the same period of study, and there was a significant decline in number of offspring produced per mature females during this time (mean percentage of offspring per mature female was 0-25%). In 2000-2005, however, birth rate increased; in previous decades, annual production of offspring for the population averaged twelve individuals annually, but then increased to 31, 29, 19, 16, and 28 offspring/year from 2001 to 2005, respectively. Right whales, in general, are thought to reach sexual maturity at body lengths of 1300-1400 cm. Courtship behavior is observed throughout the year on both birthing and feeding grounds, but fertile breeding is thought to be seasonal, with most births occurring from late December to March, with a peak in early January. Gestation is thought to be ¢.12-13 months, as has been determined for the Southern Right Whale (FE. australis ). A single young is born. Neonates are 400-550 cm long and weigh ¢.800 kg. Observations of live births of North Atlantic Right Whales at sea are extremely rare. Two live births were opportunistically observed and documented during aerial survey work in recent years. Fetal folds may be observed in newborns. Pale gray areas on head and rostrum of newborns where callosities will develop may be apparent but are smooth; they will become thickened during the first few months after birth, perhaps due, at least in part, to habitation by whale lice. Cyamids have not been observed in the callosities of newborns. Duration of lactation is 8-17 months, and it is thought that most young are weaned within their first year. Growth is rapid, with offspring reaching at least ¢.900 cm at weaning. Post-weaning growth may slow markedly until the young whale is of sufficient size and feeding ability to forage efficiently. Maximum age for North Atlantic Right Whales is not known, in part because of the difficulty of developing reliable age-determination methodologies for baleen whales, but photoidentification has placed one individual at a minimum of 70 years of age.","Right whales, in general, are commonly slow moving and occasionally rest at the surface for long periods. Nevertheless, the North Atlantic Right Whale is frequently observed engaged in active surface behavior, including breaching, lobtailing, flipper slapping, and raising flukes proceeding deep dives. It also has been observed to be very tactile, touching and rubbing conspecifics.",,"CITES Appendix I. Classified as Endangered on The IUCN Red List. The North Atlantic Right Whale was found historically on both sides of the Atlantic, and it was considered to have consisted of two populations. The eastern North Atlantic population, which is now functionally extinct,is thought to have ranged from Cintra Bay (c.23° N), a once important winter birthing ground along the coast ofthe Western Sahara to the Bay of Biscay and northward to North Cape, Norway. Population designation for individuals occasionally observed during recent years in Iceland and Norway is undetermined. In the western North Atlantic, the population of the North Atlantic Right Whale was estimated at 490 individuals in 2010. The last assessment of this population for The IUCN Red List classified it as Endangered in 2008 when the population was believed to number only 300-350 individuals along the east coast of North America. Although a roughly 1-6% increase in reproductive rate has been observed in recent years (documented in 2001 and 2005), the increase is not enough to compensate for the estimated 2% annual decline in population size that had occurred over previous decades. No original pre-whaling population estimate is available for North Atlantic Right Whales off North America, but the low estimate for the number killed between 1634 and 1951 is 5500 individuals, and it is possible that twice that number were killed. Major threats to the North Atlantic Right Whale along the east coast of North America today, are ship strikes and bycatch in different types of fishing gear. Between 1970 and 2009, 38 North Atlantic Right Whales were recorded to have been killed in vessel collisions, and 31 were killed from fishery entanglements. These numbers are not sustainable given the small population size of the North Atlantic Right Whale. Examination of photographs of 626 individuals, taken between 1980 and 2009, indicated that c.83% had scars from being entangled in fishing gear at least one time and 59% had marks from having been entangled more than once. Subadults were entangled at a higher rate than adults. Low-frequency noise produced by ships masks naturally occurring sounds and causes habitat displacement, behavioral changes, ad-Justments in vocalizations, and increased levels of physiological stress. Vessel and sonic activity associated with oil and gas exploration are also known to expose large whales to detrimental noise levels. Other threats including low genetic variability, poor nutrition, chemical contaminants, biotoxins, and disease appear to be minor compared with ship strikes and entanglements.",Allen (1916) | Baumgartner & Mate (2003 | 2005) | Baumgartner | Cole | Campbell et al.

Except on their N summer grounds, only a few sightings in the E Pacific Ocean during the past 50 years.",,"There is scant current information on habitat use of the North Pacific Right Whale. Historical records are indicative of pelagic feeding grounds in the Sea of Okhotsk, central and south-eastern Bering Sea, the Aleutian Islands, and Gulf of Alaska. In recent decades, consistent summer sightings of North Pacific Right Whales in the Sea of Okhotsk and off the Kuril Islands and Kamchatka coast substantiate these areas as important feeding grounds. Based upon repeated sightings west of Bristol Bay in the south-eastern Bering Sea, this region is important summer habitat. In this area, North Pacific Right Whales appear to select relatively shallow waters in the mid-continental shelf. Not surprisingly, distribution of North Pacific Right Whales has been noted to coincide with areas abundant in their primary prey, calanoid copepods. North Pacific Right Whales also appear to have an extensive pelagic distribution, and this is likely related to availability of adultstage copepods in these regions of the Pacific Ocean. Birthing grounds are not known. Areas that have been suggested as potential winter birthing grounds for the western North Pacific population, based on sightings and other information, include the Ryukyu Islands, Yellow Sea, Taiwan Strait, and Bonin Islands (= Ogasawara Islands). There is no information regarding the current wintering grounds of the eastern North Pacific population, except a sighting off southern Baja California, Mexico. In the central North Pacific, the southernmost recent sighting was off Maui, Hawaii. The possibility that the North Pacific Right Whale winters in distant, offshore regions has been raised.","North Pacific Right Whales are skim feeders. They appear to feed selectively on preferred prey species, as has been observed for the other balaenid species. Aggregations of North Pacific Right Whales feeding on copepods of the genus Neocalanus have been observed in the North Pacific Ocean, and these, along with copepods of the genus Calanus, are the main prey items reported for western North Pacific Right Whales. Stomachs of North Pacific Right Whales killed by Japanese and Soviet whaling vessels in the 1950s contained calanoid copepods (Neocalanus, Calanus, and Metnidia). Quantities of the amphipod crustacean Parathemisto japonica and the krill species Euphausia pacifica also were found in stomach contents. Scientists onboard the whaling vessels also conducted pelagic zooplankton sampling in areas of the southeastern Bering Sea occupied by whales and noted that Calanus finmarchicus (now recognized as C. marshallae) was abundant; the copepod was postulated to be important to North Pacific Right Whales in that region. More recently, North Pacific Right Whales have been observed feeding in shallow waters over the middle Bering Sea shelf where C. marshallae was the primary species in plankton samples.","There is very little information on reproduction of the North Pacific Right Whale. Adult females can be mature as small as 1250 cm long. Based on data from fetuses of two pregnant females killed by Soviet whaling vessels, S. K. Klumov in 1962 gave a very preliminary estimate that mating may occur in November-December. He calculated gestation of the North Pacific Right Whale at c¢.11-12 months, butthis estimate is too short given gestation of other cetaceans and based on gestation of Southern Right Whales ( E. australis ) estimated at 12-13 months.","Similarly to their congeners, North Pacific Right Whales are slow moving. They were noted to remain calm and generally show no attempt at avoidance when approached by whaling vessels. Although North Pacific Right Whales were reported by soviet scientists to make shore dives of 4-6 minutes with maximum dive times of nine minutes,it is likely that most feeding dives for this species average 10-20 minutes like those of their congeners, the North Atlantic Right Whale and the Southern Righ Whale.",,"CITES Appendix I. Classified as Endangered on The IUCN Red Last, with the north-eastern North Pacific subpopulation classified as Critically Endangered. The original distribution of the North Pacific Right Whale was never documented in any detail before it was depleted by the middle of the 19"" century. Today, whales are found in winter around the Bonin Islands, Ryukyu Islands, and Yellow Sea (west of the Korean Peninsula); in summer (feeding grounds), they are found from the Sea of Okhotsk and Kuril Islands, north to off the Kamchatka Peninsula, Commander Islands, and the western Bering Sea. In the East Pacific Ocean, North Pacific Right Whales moved north off the California coast and along the western coast of North America, but since the 1990s, they have only been seen regularly from summer to early autumn in the south-eastern Bering Sea, west of Bristol Bay, Alaska (¢.57°-59° N), and sometimes in the Gulf of Alaska. Western and eastern populations of the North Pacific Right Whale have different geographic distributions, population sizes, and stranding histories. In the western North Pacific Ocean, they are poorly known, and the only available population estimate is outdated and only preliminary based on data collected during dedicated line-transect surveys for Common Minke Whales ( Balaenoptera acutorostrata), conducted in the Sea of Okhotsk during 1989, 1990, and 1992. The resulting population estimate of 922 North Pacific Right Whales was based on only a limited number of sightings and the confidence interval was wide (404-2108 individuals). However, the most recent [UCN assessment gives 400 for the Sea of Okhotsk population size. Sighting data are available from additional Russian and Japanese surveys conducted since 1992, but they have not yet been analyzed. No assessment has been made for the north-western subpopulation of the North Pacific Right Whale because of the outdated population estimate. No estimate is available for the pre-whaling size of this subpopulation, but large numbers of right whales were taken in the North Pacific during the 19"" century, and illegal Soviet pelagic catches made during the 1960s included at least 152 whales taken from the Sea of Okhotsk. Major current threats are bycatch in various types of fishing gear. No deaths of North Pacific Right Whales from ship strikes have been reported, butthis is likely an important threat because of their coastal nature in much of their distribution, especially in coastal waters of China, Korea, and Japan. In the Sea of Okhotsk, future oil and gas activities will pose risks to North Pacific Right Whales on their summer feeding grounds. The current abundance estimate for the north-eastern North Pacific population is only ¢.30 individuals, based on independent photo-identifications and genetic mark-recaptures. No pre-whaling estimate is available for this population. They were depleted quickly in the middle of the 19"" century. Some were also killed during the start of modern commercial whaling off Alaska and British Columbia, Canada,in the early part of the 20"" century and then after c.30 years of no catches,illegal Soviet pelagic whaling operations killed a minimum of 529 individuals in the Gulf of Alaska and south-eastern Bering Sea in the 1960s. Bycatch in various types of fishing gear and ship strikes are the two most important current threats, but to date, there have not been any confirmed deaths. Potential future threats include oil and gas activities on summer feeding grounds of the North Pacific Right Whale.",Brownell et al. (2001) | Clapham | Good et al.

Concentrated in winter near the coastlines off S Australia, New Zealand, Atlantic coast of South America (Argentina, Brazil), and S Africa (mainly South Africa), but also off Chile, Peru, Tristan da Cunha Is and the E coast of Madagascar; in summer they are found mainly in latitudes of 40-50° S but have been seen in the Antarctic as far as 65° S and around South Georgia Is.",,"Feeding grounds of Southern Right Whales are not well known. In the southern Atlantic Ocean, they may be mainly offshore, and in Antarctic waters, they are also apparently predominately offshore. As with other species of right whales, feeding grounds of Southern Right Whales are likely to be areas of extremely high productivity and prey abundance. Most of the relatively few offshore sightings indicate individuals may occupy areas within the subtropical and Antarctic convergences. Sheltered, shallow waters and bays in many coastal areas are used to give birth. These birthing grounds include areas off Argentina, Brazil, Tristan da Cunha, Namibia, South Africa, Mozambique, Australia, New Zealand, Auckland Islands, and Chile.","Southern Right Whales are skim feeders, using their long, finely bristled baleen to filter prey from the water at the surface and below. Both copepods and krill are important in their diets. Euphausiids, including euphausiid krill (Euphausia superba) and squat lobster (Munida spp.), form a larger part of diets of Southern Right Whales than those of North Atlantic Right Whales ( E. glacialis ) and North Pacific Right Whales ( E. japonica ). When feeding north of the subtropical convergence, Southern Right Whales are likely to feed mainly on copepods, but they also feed on euphausiid krill within the Antarctic Convergence where krill predominates. Interestingly, whaling data reflected this pattern: 91-7% of whales north of 40° S had fed on copepods (mainly Calanus propinquus and Pleuromamma robusta), whereas more than 99% of whales south of 50° S had euphausiids in their stomachs.","Average age offirst birth for female Southern Right Whales is at 9-12 years, when females are more than 1200 cm in length. Gestation is 12-13 months. Birth interval is typically about three years but may be as long as five years when prey availability is limited. Births occur in June—-October, with a peak in late August. Neonatal length is 450-600 cm. Weaning is at a minimum of 7-8 months but can be extended to 12-14 months. Breeding is thought to mainly occur from June to September, but like North Atlantic Right Whales, mating of Southern Right Whales has been observed throughout the year. Southern Right Whales are known to aggregate in large surface-active groups where males appear to compete for a single female—as is also similar to North Atlantic Right Whales. Mating has been observed on and around birthing grounds, but some segregation is likely between breeding adults and female—offspring pairs.","Like their congeners, Southern Right Whales are slow moving, often resting or logging at the surface. They are also often observed breaching and engaging in other active behaviors at the water’s surface, including flipper slapping and lobtailing. Southern Right Whales in Argentina and South Africa use their flukes as sails at the water’s surface, letting the wind glide them through the water for short distances. Tactile behavior—touching and rubbing conspecifics—has also been observed in Southern Right Whales.",,"CITES Appendix I. Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List, with the Peru—Chile subpopulation of the Southern Right Whale classified as Critically Endangered. Moving clockwise from the western South Atlantic Ocean, Southern Right Whales are found from May through December in coastal waters off Brazil, from ¢.8-32° S (mainly 27-29° S) to Uruguay and south to central Argentina (mainly around Valdes Peninsula) and south to Cabo Virgenes (52° 19° S) and into the Straits of Magellan and the Beagle Channel. In the mid-South Atlantic Ocean, they are found around Tristan da Cunha (c.38° S, 12° E). In the eastern South Atlantic Ocean, Southern Right Whales are found in the north off the Namibian/Angolan coast (c.16—-27° S), with the majority found between 18° 30” S and 21° 30’ S, and then south to South Africa between Saint Helena Bay in the west and Port Elizabeth to the east. In the south-western Indian Ocean, they are in waters off Mozambique and Madagascar. Off western Australia in the eastern Indian Ocean, Southern Right Whales occurin the north at least as far as Exmouth (c.22° S, 114° E), but most are found between Cape Leeuwin, Western Australia (32° 33° S, 115° 08 E) and Ceduna, South Australia (32° 08’ S, 133° 41"" E). In the south-western Pacific Ocean, they were known from the coastal waters around New Zealand and the Kermadec Islands (29° S, 178° W), where they are now absent. There are some recent records of Southern Right Whales reestablishing former wintering grounds off mainland New Zealand. Southern Right Whales are found near the Auckland Islands during austral winter and in North-west Bay, Campbell Island, in February-September. In the eastern South Pacific Ocean, the few remaining Southern Right Whales are known from Bahia San Fernando, Peru (15° 08S) in the north, southward to at least Isla Grande de Chiloe, Chile (42° S), but they are more commonly observed around Isla Grande de Chile, Chile. The bestknown feeding areas of the Southern Right Whales are around the Falkland Islands and South Georgia (February—May), the Antarctic Peninsula, and below 40° S off Australia. In the Indian Ocean, they are known from the Crozet Islands (c.46° S, 51° E) and Kerguelen Islands. In 1997, the total population of the Southern Right Whale was ¢.7600 individuals in the three ocean basins of the Southern Hemisphere. The Southern Right Whale has long been widely recognized as having had been over-utilized and depleted by commercial hunting during the late 18"" 19""and early 20"" centuries— hunting that only ended in the 1930s. During the 200 years between the start of commercial whaling for the Southern Right Whale in the 1770s and complete cessation in the early 1970s, total catch was ¢.115,000 individuals. Combined catches within each of the three ocean basins were ¢.63,000 individuals in the South Atlantic, 38,000 in the South Pacific, and 13,000 in the Indian Ocean. This included more than 3300 Southern Right Whales taken illegally during Soviet pelagic whaling operations, mainly in the 1960s. Based on a model used at the International Whaling Commission (IWC) 1998 Right Whale Workshop, the initial abundance of Southern Right Whales in 1770 was estimated at ¢.55,000-70,000 individuals. After human exploitation ceased, most populations of Southern Right Whales began to increase. Total population size was estimated at ¢.7600 individuals in 1997, and the population model used to make this estimate suggested a current annual growth rate of 7-5%, although this rate of increase may have slowed in recent years. No current population assessmentis available. The Brazil-Argentina population of the Southern Right Whale in Argentine waters was estimated at 2577 individuals in 1997. In waters off Argentina, the population had been increasing 6-8-7-6% /year since the early 1970s, butthis rate is now slowing to ¢.6%/ year. Since 2003 when the Southern Right Whale Monitoring Program was established in the region of Valdes Peninsula, Argentina, 366 whale deaths have been recorded; number of dead individuals per year was 31 in 2003, 47 in 2005, 83 in 2007, 95 in 2008, and 79 in 2009, with more than 90% of the deaths being young born in those years. Causes of these annual die-offs remain unknown, but a workshop in 2010 agreed on three likely hypotheses (or some combination of them): (1) reduced food availability for adult females, (2) acute or chronic toxicity resulting from exposure to biotoxins, and (3) infectious disease. As of October 2012, another large die-off was underway. In breeding areas around Valdes Peninsula, kelp gulls (Larus dominicanus) feed by pecking on skin and blubber on backs of Southern Right Whales. This gull harassment has increased since it was first documented in 1972, and extensive wounding is now sometimes observed on backs of Southern Right Whales, frequently on female—offspring pairs. It has been suggested that gull attacks could negatively affect the population of Southern Right Whales via disruption to female—offspring pairs and potential transmission of pathogens and infectious diseases. A subsequent workshop, convened in 2013, concluded that the increasing frequency of gull attacks, including concomitant increases in physical and behavioral disturbance to Southern Right Whales, has reached a threshold level in recent years above which these factors may induce death in some Southern Right Whale offspring, leading to the high levels of mortality recorded since 2005. In South African waters, the population of the Southern Right Whale was estimated at 3104 individuals in 1997. In 2008, the population estimate had only increased to 3612 individuals. There has not been any die-off in this area, but entanglementin fishing gearis ¢.3:5% /year. The Australian population of the Southern Right Whale was estimated at 1197 individuals in 1997. In 2009, the best estimate in Australia between Cape Leeuwin and Ceduna was 2900 individuals. Based on photoidentification, genetic samples, and mark-recapture methods comparing winter surveys between 1995-1997 and 2006-2009, number of Southern Right Whales off the Auckland Islands was estimated at a minimum of 2306 individuals. The Peru—Chile subpopulation of the Southern Right Whale likely has fewer than 50 individuals remaining. No pre-whaling population estimate is available, but it is known that French vessels alone killed an estimated 2372 Southern Right Whales in Chilean waters in 1817-1837. Mortalities of South Right Whales due to entanglements in fishing gear and collisions with ships are known throughout the Southern Hemisphere, and human activities in Chile caused at least two whale deaths: one was a young individual harpooned by fishermen and the other was a young that stranded after being struck by a vessel. Any human-caused mortality, especially females, in this subpopulation is a serious issue. Vessel strikes and fishing gear entanglement of Southern Right Whales are rare compared with the number of cases known for North Atlantic Right Whales. In Australia, there are at least four cases of entanglementin fishing gear in 1991-1997. In other parts of the Southern Hemisphere, known fishing-gear entanglements include the following: at least 14 entanglements in South Africa in 1963-1997; two in the Auckland Islands in 1995-1997; seven in Argentina in 1969-1997; approximately four per year in Santa Catarina, Brazil, in 1989-1997; three along the San Paulo coast, Brazil, in 1982-1996; and three off Rio de Janeiro in 1981-1992. Southern Right Whales killed or injured by vessel collisions are known from South Africa and Brazil. Thirteen collisions, ten of which were fatal, occurred off South Africa in 1983-1997, and four collisions, at least three fatal, occurred off Brazil in 1989-1993. Collisions with large vessels are of concern for Southern Right Whales around Australia, particularly on shipping routes on the eastern seaboard near the Bass Strait. Numbers of vessel strikes and gear entanglements are too small in relation to current population sizes to impede continued population growth and recovery of populations of Southern Right Whales, except for the Peru—Chile subpopulation. Disturbance and displacement caused by ship noise are threats to Southern Right Whales, perhaps especially in feeding and birthing grounds, and they could potentially disrupt important social activities including breeding. Harassment from whale watching and boaters also potentially present a threat. Prey depletion caused by overfishing of krill and habitat degradation may impact populations of Southern Right Whales. Potential effects of climate change on krill (E. superba) abundance, and thus ability of Southern Right Whales to feed on this prey, could impact their continued recovery.",Aguayo et al.

It has been suggested that these icy regions serve as a refuge from Killer Whales (Orcinus orca). Bowhead Whales select habitat in the Arctic that is characterized by high productivity and availability of zooplankton prey. In summer, they generally occupy continental slope waters with moderate ice conditions. In autumn, Bowhead Whales occupy inner shelf waters with relatively light ice conditions.","Stomach contents of Bowhead Whales have been well documented. Numerous prey species have been identified in their stomachs, but there is a clear preference for copepods (Calanus) and eupausiid krill. Mysid shrimps and gammarid amphipods are also sometimes prevalent in stomachs of Bowhead Whales. They skim the water’s surface to feed and also feed in the water column and at the seafloor. Bowhead Whales have been observed surface skimming synchronously, moving on their sides with mouths open, synchronously diving and surfacing while feeding, and cooperatively feeding, including in echelon formation. Typical feeding dives may last 5-15 minutes.","Breeding of the Bowhead Whale is thought to occurin late winter and early spring. Sexual activity has been observed throughout the year. Breeding is thoughtto involve sperm competition, and like right whales, mating groups are often composed of a single female with multiple males competing for access. Estimated gestation is 13— 14 months. Young are born in spring, with a peak in May. Young Bowhead Whales are 470-500 cm long at birth. Total length at one year of age is ¢.820 cm. Length at sexual maturity is estimated to be 1300-1350 cm for females and 1200-1300 cm for males.","Bowhead Whales are slow moving, and they are also observed breaching and fluke slapping at the surface. Flukes are lifted prior to deep dives. Data for eight Bowhead Whales equipped with satellite-monitored radio tags in the Beaufort and Chuckchi seas for approximately one month indicated that many dives were short, less than one minute in duration. Most dives were shallow to c¢.16 m. Five of the whales dove deeper than 100 m, with the deepest dive recorded at 352 m. Deeper dives, which occurred over the deep-water Mackenzie Canyon, were thought to be associated with feeding behavior. Bowhead Whales may be capable of dives with durations of up to approximately one hour. They can break through ice of ¢.60 cm thick and may sometimes make their way through ice floes in this manner.",,"CITES Appendix I. Classified as Least Concern on The [UCN Red List, with the Sea of Okhotsk subpopulation classified as Endangered and the Spitsbergen subpopulation classified as Critically Endangered. The Bowhead Whale traditionally has been divided into five subpopulations, or “putative stocks,” mainly based on geographic discontinuities: Baffin Bay—Davis Strait, Hudson Bay-Foxe Basin, Bering—Chuckchi-Beaufort Seas (BCB), Sea of Okhotsk, and Svalbard-Barents Sea (Spitsbergen). Nevertheless, recent satellite tracking and genetic data have resulted in combining Baffin Bay—Davis Strait and Hudson Bay—Foxe Basin into a single stock, which is now called the Eastern Canada—Western Greenland stock. The Spitsbergen Bowhead Whales are found across the North Atlantic from off eastern Greenland (Denmark) in the Greenland Sea, the Barents Sea, and into the Kara Sea to Severnaya Zemlya (Russia), and south at least occasionally to northern Iceland and the coast of Norway and Jan Mayen (Norway). The stock of Bowhead Whales in the Sea of Okhotsk is restricted to the northern part of this region. During summer, these whales are mainly in waters south of Shantar Island and in spring in the gulfs of Gizhiginskaya and Penzhinskaya; during the winter, they live in polynyas (open water surrounded by ice) in the region. They are rare outside this region, but one stranding is known from Osaka Bay, Japan, in 1969. The largest and best known population of Bowhead Whales occurs in the BCB seas from Chaunskaya Bay (c.69° 21’N, 169° 46’E), Russia, in the western Chukchi Sea east to Amundsen Gulf in Canada, and in the northern Bering Sea south to Karaginskiy Bay near the base of Kamchatka Peninsula (c.59° 33’N, 164° 48°E), St. Matthew Island, Alaska. The newly combined Eastern Canada-Western Greenland population is found in summer in the Hudson Bay-Foxe Basin region in northern Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, Foxe Channel, and Foxe Basin. In the Baffin Bay-Davis Strait region, Bowhead Whales spend summer in the eastern Canadian Arctic Archipelago and off the east coast of Baffin Island. As ice forms in autumn, they are found in open water near the ice edge off West Greenland and eastern Baffin Island. Summering grounds include Cumberland Sound, and in late summer and autumn, their feeding grounds are in Isabella Bay, Lancaster Sound, Admiralty Inlet, and Eclipse Sound. In recent years, there has been some spatial overlap in the extreme summer ranges of the BCB and Eastern Canada—Western Greenland stocks. In 2006-2010, 58 Bowhead Whales from the BCB stock and West Greenland were tagged and tracked via satellite. Two of them entered the Northwest Passage in the Canadian High Arctic, one from the BCB stock and one from the opposite direction in West Greenland. They spent approximately ten days in the same area, demonstrating that there is at least some seasonal overlap between the two stocks. This overlap is the result of climate change that has opened the Northwest Passage to populations of Bowhead Whales previously separated by sea ice. The global population of Bowhead Whales is estimated at more than 24,000 individuals, with the majority of them found in the BCB stock. All stocks were greatly reduced by commercial whaling starting in 1610 in the eastern North Atlantic Ocean. Bowhead Whales are hunted today by indigenous Russian, Alaskan, Canadian, and Greenland hunters in subsistence fisheries that are closely monitored and have with annual quotas. More recently, the Eastern Canada—Western Greenland stock is also increasing. Nevertheless, status of stocks in the Sea of Okhotsk and Svalbard-Barents Sea (Spitsbergen) in terms of actual numbers and any population growth remain unclear. The BCB stock has been increasing at least since the mid-1970s when a longterm monitoring program began. The BCB stock in spring 2011 was estimated at 16,892 individuals and from the mid-1970s to 2004, the stock increased 3-5% /year. The original BCB stock was estimated at 10,000-20,000 individuals. Therefore, the current stock is well within the range of its historic abundance. This stock is listed as a subpopulation on The IUCN Red List as Least Concern, the same as the overall listing for the species, because the BCB whales make up the majority of the world population of Bowhead Whales. The abundance estimate of the Eastern Canada—Western Greenland subpopulation was 6344 individuals in 2003, but the minimum original size of this stock was estimated at ¢.24,000 individuals. Therefore, the current stock is only c.25% ofits original numbers. This stock has not been assessed for The IUCN Red List. Current size of the subpopulation in the Sea of Okhotsk is poorly known. The only estimate, based on genetic mark-recapture data from 2000, is 247 individuals. During the 1960s,illegal Soviet pelagic whaling operations killed at least 145 Bowhead Whales in the Sea of Okhotsk. Minimum pre-whaling number was estimated to be ¢.3000 individuals. Therefore, at best, the current stock is less than 10% ofits original size. There is no population estimate for the Spitsbergen stock, butit is thought to number under 100 individuals and there is limited evidence that it is increasing. The minimum pre-whaling size of the Spitsbergen stock was ¢.12,000 individuals. For all four subpopulations of Bowhead Whales, the primary potential threat is disturbance from oil and gas activities, which can decrease feeding efficiency. Other threats include bycatch from different types of fishing gear. How the future loss of sea ice due to climate change will affect Bowhead Whales is unknown, but ship strikes will no doubt increase as ship traffic and industrialization increase in their arctic habitat. Ship noise will also increase, and background noise masks calling among Bowhead Whales. As oil and gas activities increase, there is also an increased risk of oil spills. Oil would clearly be destructive to habitats of Bowhead Whales and increase their exposure to contaminants. Spilled oil would also matt their baleen plates, making it impossible for them to filter feed.",Alter et al. (2012) | Brandon & Wade (2004) | Burns et al. (1993) | Citta et al.

Occasionally, it eats carrion and earthworms.","Young African Brush-tailed Porcupines are found during most months of the year in the DR Congo, and this pattern likely occurs throughout the Rainforest Biotic Zone. In the wild, females have 2-3 litters/year. Gestation lasts 100-120 days, followed by birth oflitters of 1-2 young (occasionally up to four). Female African Brushtailed Porcupines are likely polyovular, so the common litter size of one observed in captivity may be an artifact of holding conditions.

Females in captivity show spontaneous estrous cycles in a polyestrous pattern, with an average estrous cycle of 27-1 days. Young are born weighing ¢.100-175 g and are precocious; their eyes are open, and they have soft spine-like hairs on their back and flanks and can walk on all four legs within a few hours of birth. Young nurse for about two months although they begin to eat solid food at 2-3 weeks of age. The African Brush-tailed Porcupine grows slowly; adult size is reached after ¢.300 days, and sexual maturity at about two years of age or older.","The African Brush-tailed Porcupine is a strictly nocturnal and primarily terrestrial. It hides during the day in dens located in hollow trees, hollow logs, caves, or underbrush piles or roots of large trees (it does not dig its own burrow). It defecates regularly at the same place, either under a rock or in a den. It walks and trots along the forest floor, swims readily, and can climb trees to a limited extent to escape pursuit threat. While moving, it carriesits tail held slightly upward and back from its body; sometimes rustling of rattle-quills can be heard even when it cannot be seen. African Brush-tailed Porcupines in the wild in Gabon typically left their hiding places at ¢.17:00 h, returning to their dens at c¢.05:30 h. Nightly activity, particularly among females, usually followed a trimodal pattern with two rest periods during the night, although the pattern shifted to bimodal on moonlit nights. Female rest periods clustered around 20:00-21:00 h and again at 02:00-04:00 h. Males spent more time immobile and had more irregular patterns, resting in the middle of the night. Individuals also took rest periods of about ten minutes every hour; these rests tended to be longer in the middle of the night than at the start or end, and longer in the presence of bright moonlight. On dark nights, females did not normally take a rest in the middle of night, although males rested some of the time. Average inactive time on dark nights was 1-9 hours. On nights close to full moonlight, period of inactivity increased to an average of 3-4 hours. When alarmed or threatened, an African Brush-tailed Porcupine will raise spines on its back and shakeits tail, rustling the bristles.

In Italy, the Crested Porcupine changesits diet seasonally, consuming roots as the predominant food year-round, supplemented by herbs in winter and spring, grass inflorescences and fruits in summer, and fruits in autumn.","The Crested Porcupine, like the Cape Porcupine and the Indian Crested Porcupine, is monogamous. Breeding takes place throughout the year, with a female giving birth to 1-2 precocial offspring once or twice per year. In captivity, there is a nightly rhythm of mounting. Multiple mountings per night are typical, but copulation takes place only during estrus (a difference from the Indian Crested Porcupine and the Cape Porcupine in which mounting and copulation take place independent of stage of estrus). The female Crested Porcupine presses her quills against her back to allow mating. Gestation lasts 7-8 weeks,after which litters of 1-4 young are born in a grass-lined burrow. Longevity is up to 20 years.","The Crested Porcupine is nocturnal. Individuals spend their days at rest in burrows. In Italy, a Crested Porcupine might share its burrow with a European Badger (Meles meles). The Crested Porcupine is active across a wide range of temperatures, with mean duration of nocturnal and crepuscular activity in central Italy lasting on average 9-2 hours/night, varying little throughout the year. In cold months when nights were longer, individuals left burrows after sunset and returned some hours before sunrise. In the warm season, they left at sunset or shortly before and returned at or shortly after sunrise. Moonlight avoidance is slight. Diurnal activity is scarce. When alarmed, a Crested Porcupine first raises its quills and erects its crest; second,it rattles its tail; and third, it stomps its hindfeet and growls. If these displays fail to deter a threat, it may attack by moving rapidly backward and sideways toward it, stabbing it with its long defensive quills that detach easily from the skin.",,"Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. The Crested Porcupine is a nationally protected species in Italy, although its eradication from Sardinia, where it has been recently introduced, has been recommended. Some recommend listing the Crested Porcupine as an endangered species in Europe, due to destruction of maquis,its optimal habitat, and because of poaching (especially in recently colonized areas). Payments of up to €19,500/year are claimed for crop damage by farmers in southern Tuscany. Distributional expansion in Italy would suggest that the Crested Porcupine is in fact doing well. Lack of data on abundance and densities regionally and nationally in Italy makes management a challenge. In Africa, the Crested Porcupine is one of the most important species for subsistence and income in the Albertine Rift where it is used for human food and wearing apparel. Almost nothing is written about ecology or behavior of the Crested Porcupine from anywhere in Africa. Although there remains some debate about how the Crested Porcupine came to be in Italy, its presence there is likely the result of an introduction from North Africa. Although there are fossil remains from the genus Hystrix in Europe beyond Italy, recent molecular analysis of three genes from Italian and African specimens shows a pattern of diversity congruent with an introduction from northern Africa during the Roman Age; one of three clades revealed in the analysis grouped Italian specimens together with specimens from Tunisia. A large number of DNA haplotypes present in Italian specimens may indicate several introductions over historical time. Since the 1970s, distribution of the Crested Porcupine in Italy has been expanding northward and eastward, crossing the Apennines from the Tyrrhenian coast to Marche. Historical and social factors, including progressive urbanization and consequent abandonment of traditional land use in mountainous areas, probably have contributed to distributional expansion. Despite suggestions otherwise, the Crested Porcupine has never occurred on the Ionian and Aegean islands, the Balkans, or the Iberian Peninsula in the Holocene, even in the very recent past.",Amori & Angelici (1992) | Angelici | Cabras & Trucchi (2009) | Angelici | Capizzi et al.

It is particularly adept at exploiting patchy vegetation of semiarid and arid habitats. In the Negev Desert,it eats at least 18 species of geophytes (tubers, bulbs, corms, rhizomes and other subterranean structures) and hemicryptophytes. Its use of geophytes increases water balance and reduce exposure to plants with low nutrient content, low digestibility, or high concentrations of secondary metabolites. Fasted captive Indian Crested Porcupines consumed 528-7 g potatoes within 45 minutes and averaged 147-9 g/hour thereafter. Averaged total intake was 1239-4 g fresh mass for 5-8 h of feeding. Nightly intakes were 198-3 g dry matter, 1092 ml preformed water, and 3056 kJ of energy. Maintenance energy requirement of captive porcupines was 220 kJ/kg/day. In the Negev Desert, daily water intake was significantly higher in summer than winter, although there were no differences in seasonal ad libitum food intake by captive individuals. The Indian Crested Porcupine also eats grains and fruits. Digging as a form of ecological disturbance has an important positive role in increasing plant biomass, density, and species richness across patchy landscapes of the Negev Desert. Density of porcupine digs in highlands of the Negev Desert varied from more than 1 dig/m? on a densely vegetated plateau to 0-1 dig/m? on a sparsely vegetated deep loess. Digs of Indian Crested Porcupines persist for 1-6-5 years, depending on size. Individuals appeared to exploit the same food patches over time. Investigatory sniffing is a major behavior probably associated with searching for food. Indian Crested Porcupines use a stereotypical posture when eating, in which body is prone, hindlegs are outstretched, and forelimbs rest on ground; food items are manipulated with inner front paws. The Indian Crested Porcupine can be a pest to agriculture by raiding crops and to forestry by debarking trees at ground level. In India, it is destructive to sweet potato, sugarcane, and maize crops and production forests. It gnaws bones, horns, and antlers. In Israel, consumption of roots and aboveground crops and bark of cultivated trees and damage to irrigation tubing causesit to be regarded as the most important agricultural pest among the country’s large mammals. Time required to forage might limit occurrence of Indian Crested Porcupines to areas where nights are not less than seven hours. Most northern populations are at ¢.44° N, where night duration at summersolstice is ¢.7-3 hours. To occur north of this boundary, Indian Crested Porcupines would have to forage during daylight or reduce food intake. Otherwise, northern distributional limits do not coincide with broad bioclimatic or vegetation boundaries.","The Indian Crested Porcupine, like the Cape Porcupine and the Crested Porcupine, is monogamous. Observations of captive pairs found that females presented themselves to males, and males copulated with them (including intromission) every night throughout the year. The male, who parades in front of the female and then stands motionless for several minutes with his quills erect, might also initiate mating. Next, he approaches and retreats from the female several times, while making squawking sounds. Copulation takes place during pregnancy and lactation and is not restricted to estrus. In Pakistan, breeding has been recorded in March-April. Females give birth to litters of 1-4 young in “maternity chambers,” cushioned with grass or leaves. Neonates weigh ¢.3% of their mother’s weight at birth and require a long nursing period. Eyes open at or within a few hours of birth, and incisors have broken through completely. Back spikes are still soft, short, and ¢.30 mm long; tail rattle-quills are soft and silent. Sensory bristles are developed and extend beyond lengths of spikes. Newborns are very active and agile within hours of birth. From birth to about three months of age, young are cared for by their fathers that perform all of the same parental care behaviors as their mothers, except nursing and licking their anogenital areas. Running toward a newborn when it utters a distress call is predominantly a male response. During the first month after birth of young, the male spends ¢.30% ofhis active time alone with newborns and ¢.20% of his time with the female and newborns. During the second and third month after birth, there is a gradual decrease in percent active time spent alone with newborns by both males and females and a gradual increase in percent active time that both parents spend with young.","Indian Crested Porcupines are strictly nocturnal. They spend daytime hours in dens (natural caves or excavated burrows). Timing of den emergence varies with season. In winter, they largely confine their behavior to darker nights or darker periods of the night and strongly avoid bright moonlight. In summer, they are active independent of moonlight given the shorter nights. Mean duration of nocturnal activity is 9-2 hours in summervs. 6-7 hours in winter. Indian Crested Porcupines remain closer to dens on bright nights than dark nights throughout the year. Rainfall curtails activity. Activity pattern may be influenced by predation risk; one study used the method of “giving up density” and found that porcupines have lowest foraging costs in habitats with densest cover and on dark nights. In a camera trapping study in western Nepal, porcupine activity was significantly more common during the central part of the night (23:00 h to 02:00 h) than in crepuscular or daylight periods. When sensing danger, Indian Crested Porcupines erect their quills and rattle their tails menacingly.",,"Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. Poaching of the Indian Crested Porcupine is a conservation threat in India. It is threatened in western Asia because it is hunted for food and considered an agricultural pest. It serves as an intermediate host for Linguatula serrata, a zoonotic parasite whose definitive hosts are carnivores and humans. Much of what is known about ecology and behavior of the Indian Crested Porcupine comes from the Negev Desert; further research in other habitats across its broad distribution are warranted.",Agrawal (2000) | Alkon (1999) | Alkon & Olsvig-Whittaker (1989) | Alkon & Saltz (1985 | 1988) | Alkon et al.

In South Africa, Cape Porcupines prefer Burkea—Acacia savanna, probably due to concentration of preferred foods. They are not found in swampy areas.","The Cape Porcupine is omnivorous and eats subterranean tubers, bulbs, and roots; shoots; fruits; and stems. Osteophagy is common, particularly in phosphorous-limited areas. It might eat carrion. It is considered a pest by farmers; it will raid melon, pumpkin, and maize crops; uproot young trees; and damage young plantations by debarking and feeding on innerliving tissue of trees from ground level to c.0-5 m up the trunk. Cape Porcupines are ecosystem engineers because their foraging has landscape-level effects through food choice and physical effects of digging. Selective bark feeding in some natural savanna ecosystems may influence patterns of succession. Cape Porcupines dig circular, conical holes in the soil surface in search of tubers, insect larvae, and seeds, which creates sites for seedlings and allows water to infiltrate the soil crust. Digging by Cape Porcupines annually disturbs 0-34% ofthe soil surface and displace 1-6 m®/ha/year ofsoil acrossits distribution.","The Cape Porcupine,like the Crested Porcupine and the Indian Crested Porcupine ( H. indica ), is monogamous. Sexual maturity is reached at 8-18 months of age for males and in the second year oflife for females. Males and females are reproductive throughout the year. In both captive and wild individuals in South Africa, most litters are born in August-March, corresponding to periods of summer rain; this timing probably maximizes neonatal survival, especially in arid regions that experience cold, dry winters. Females are polyestrous, with cycle lengths of 17-42 days. Sexual activity (lordosis, mounting, and ejaculation) occurs throughout estrus, pregnancy, and lactation, but actual copulation outside of estrus is hindered by presence of a vaginal closure membrane. This physical contact between sexes maintains cyclic ovarian activity and may strengthen pair bonds. Estrus begins when vaginal membrane opens, coinciding with a surge in 17B-estradiol. Copulation is typically preceded by the female approaching the male and occurs ¢.2-8 days after onset of estrus. The female adopts a receptive posture, with tail and rump raised and quills pointed away from the male. He mounts the female from behind, with his forepaws resting on her back. Intromission only occurs when the female is in estrus. After mating, a copulatory plug is formed. Gestation lasts 93-105 days, and females average onelitter per year, with 1-3 precocial young; 59% oflitters produce singletons and 30% twins. Newborns weigh 300-400 g and have soft defensive quills and closed, pointed rattle-quills at birth. Young nibble on solid foods by 9-14 days of age and begin to feed alone at 4-6 weeks of age, although they continue to nurse for 13-19 weeks when they weigh 2.5-4.7 kg. Lactation averages 101 days and includes c.110 days of anestrus during lactation. The father provides paternal care by accompanying young on foraging trips, grooming and huddling with them, and protecting them from threats. Although Cape Porcupines live in family groups, only the adult pair reproduces. Females are almost continuously exposed to sexually mature males. Subordinate females experience cyclic ovarian activity, but only the dominant female conceives. Mechanism of reproductive suppression of subordinate females is unknown, but progesterone concentrations, despite cyclic changes, remain insufficient for implantation. Social factors may impact ovarian function. Females separated from males in captivity experience impairment of ovarian function. Physical contact with males may be required to sustain regular follicular and luteal activities of females. Densities might influence whether or not females reproduce during their first year. Conception in sexually mature females is suppressed until after dispersal from her natal group. Cape Porcupineslive for about ten years in the wild and up to 20 years in captivity.","Cape Porcupines are nocturnal. They spend their days at rest in shelters in rock crevices, caves, or abandoned burrows of Aardvarks (Orycteropus afer), which they modify to suit their needs with their front claws. They may excavate their own holes or use termite mounds as dens. Cape Porcupines often bring bones into their shelters. They forage alone at night, although pairs forage near one another, spending less than 25% of their active periods more than 400 m apart and spending more than 50% of active time within 200 m of one another. A pair of Cape Porcupines foraging in proximity of one other could be mate guarding because it is not apparent that they cooperate in foraging or anti-predator defense. When alarmed, defensive action is to raise quills and shake the rattle-quills. If a threat does not subside, a Cape Porcupine might attack by backing rapidly toward the threat, stabbing it with long defensive quills that detach easily from skin.",,"Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. Cape Porcupines damage crops and are a source of accessible meat protein to indigenous people, leaving them vulnerable to hunting, trapping, and snaring. Their role as an ecosystem engineer indicates that their protection should be included in conservation plans.

Stable sand dunes are believed to be ideal habitat, although the foxes also live in very sparsely vegetated sand dunes near the Atlantic coast. Annual rainfall is less than 100 mm per year on the northern fringe of the Fennec’s distribution. On the southern fringe, it may be found up to the Sahelian areas that receive as much as 300 mm rainfall per year. In the Sahara, sparse vegetation is usually dominated by Aristida spp., and Ephedra alata in large sand dunes. On small sand dunes, it is dominated by Panicum turgidum, Zygophyllum spp., and sometimes by trees like Acacia spp. and Capparis decidua.","Fennecs are omnivorous, consuming insects, small rodents (e.g. Jaculus jaculus, Gerbillus spp. , and Meriones spp. ), lizards (e.g. Acanthodactylus spp.), geckos (e.g. Stenodactylus spp.), skinks (e.g. Scincus albifasciatus), eggs, small birds (e.g. larks and sandgrouse), and various fruits and tubers. Fennecs hunt alone. They have not been seen using the “mouse jump” hunting strategy typical of most fox species, but reportedly dig to find insects and small vertebrates. Like other foxes they cache food by burying it.","First mating is reported to occur at nine months to one year. Fennecs mate in January and February and give birth in March and April. They most commonly give birth once annually, but more than one litter per year is possible under some conditions. The copulatory tie is exceptionally long, lasting as much as two hours and forty-five minutes. Gestation is 50-52 days. Litter size ranges from 1-4, and weaning takes place at 61-70 days. Dens are always dug in sand, in open areas or places sheltered by plants such as Aristida pungens and Calligonum comosum. Dens may be huge and labyrinthine, especially in the most compacted soils, covering up to 120 m ? and with as many as 15 entrances, and may be close together or even interconnected.

In southern Morocco , Fennecs were commonly seen in all sandy areas away from permanent human settlements. The primary threat appears to be trapping for photographic exhibition, sale to the pet trade or tourists, and for fur by the indigenous people of North Africa. Though restricted to marginal areas, new permanent human settlements such as those in southern Morocco have resulted in the disappearance of Fennecs in these areas.",Asa et al.

Known populations in Egypt , Israel , Jordan , Oman , Saudi Arabia , and United Arab Emirates . The species also ranges across much of Afghanistan and Iran , and surrounding regions in Pakistan , Tajikistan , Turkmenistan , and Uzbekistan .",,"Confined to dry, mountainous regions, generally below 2000 m . All the records collected on the Persian Plateau are from foothills and mountains in the vicinity of lower plains and basins, where the species’ habitat comprises the slopes of rocky mountains with stony plains and patches of cultivation. Appears to avoid higher mountain ranges and lower, warmer valleys, although the densest known population is found in the Judaean Desert, 100-350 m below sea level. In the Middle East, Blanford’s Foxes are confined to mountainous desert ranges and inhabit steep, rocky slopes, canyons, and cliffs. Blanford’s Foxes are not limited by access to water in the Arabian Desert, and in Israel they inhabit the driest and hottest regions.","Blanford’s Foxes in Israel are primarily insectivorous and frugivorous. Invertebrates are the major food, beetles, grasshoppers, ants, and termites being eaten most often. They eat the fruits of two caperbush species, Capparis cartilaginea and C. spinosa, fruits and plant material of Phoenix dactylifera, Ochradenus baccatus, Fagonia mollis, and various species of Gramineae. Remains of vertebrates were present in about 10% of fecal samples analysed in one study. Blanford’s Foxes in Pakistan are largely frugivorous, feeding on Russian olives (Eleagnus bortensis), melons, and grapes. They are almost always solitary foragers, only occasionally foraging in pairs. Foraging behavior includes unhurried movements back and forth between rocky patches in a small area, sniffing and looking under large stones and occasionally digging, standing near a bush prior to circling the bush or pouncing upon prey within, and short, fast sprints after small terrestrial or low-flying prey. Food caching is rare or absent, unlike other fox species.","Blanford’s Foxes live in monogamous pairs. Females are monoestrous and come into estrus during January and February. Gestation period is about 50-60 days, and litter size is 1-3 pups. Females have 2-6 active teats, and the lactation period is 30- 45 days. Neonates are born with soft, black fur. The body mass of a sub-adult is reached in about 3—4 months ( 700-900 g ). Young are entirely dependent upon their mother’s milk until they begin to forage for themselves. At two months of age the young start to forage, accompanied by one of the parents, and at three months of age they start to forage alone. Adult foxes have never been observed to carry food to the young. As in other small canids, food appears not to be regurgitated to the young. Males have been observed grooming and accompanying two- to four-month-old juveniles, but have not been seen feeding them or the female. Sexual maturity is reached at 10-12 months of age. Offspring often remain within their natal home range until autumn (October— November). Blanford’s Fox dens in Israel were usually on a mountain slope and consisted of large rock and boulder piles or scree. The foxes appeared to use only available natural cavities and never dug burrows. Dens were used for rearing young during spring and for daytime resting throughout the year. During winter and spring, both members of a pair frequently occupied the same den, or adjacent dens at the same site, while during summer and autumn they often denned in separate locations. Frequent changes in den location from day to day were more common in summer and autumn.","Strictly nocturnal, likely an anti-predator response to diurnal raptors. The onset of activity is governed largely by light conditions, and closely follows sunset. Foxes are active about 8-9 hours per night, independent of the duration of darkness. Average distance travelled per night is approximately 9 km . Climatic conditions at night in the desert appear to have little direct effect on the activity of Blanford’s Foxes.",,"CITES Appendix II.

The threat from habitat loss in Israel is limited, as most of the area where this species occurs is designated as protected.

May occur in SW Swaziland , and possibly also in Lesotho .",,"Mainly open country, including grassland with scattered thickets and lightly wooded areas, particularly in the dry Karoo regions of South Africa , the Kalahari Desert, and the fringes of the Namib Desert. Also in lowland fynbos in the Western Cape , as well as agricultural lands, where the foxes lie up in surviving pockets of natural vegetation during the day and forage on arable and cultivated fields at night. Along the eastern flank of the Namib Desert in Namibia , they occupy rock outcroppings and inselbergs, ranging out onto bare gravel plains at night. In Botswana , they have been recorded in Acacia scrubland, short grassland, and especially on the edges of shallow seasonal pans, as well as cleared and overgrazed areas. In the central Karoo of South Africa they occupy the plains as well as low, rocky ridges and isolated rock outcroppings. In KwaZulu-Natal , South Africa , they have been recorded at elevations of 1000-1500 m .","The Cape Fox consumes a wide range of food items, including small rodents (murids), hares, reptiles, birds, invertebrates, and some wild fruits. An analysis of the contents of 57 stomachs collected across western and central South Africa and Botswana showed that rodents were the most commonly eaten mammal prey; beetles (larvae and adults) and grasshoppers comprised the majority of invertebrate intake. Birds and reptiles are occasionally included in the diet, but are probably less important. The largest wild prey species recorded are hares and spring hares. Cape Foxes will also scavenge and occasionally take young lambs and goats. Foraging is solitary, although foxes may occasionally gather in loose groupings to forage at an abundant food source. They obtain their prey mostly by digging rapidly with their front paws, often preceded by periods of intentlistening. Caching of prey is common.","Breeding appears to be non-seasonal in some areas, and strongly seasonal in others. The majority of births take place in spring and summer (August to October). Juveniles and sub-adults have been recorded in the Western and Northern Cape Provinces during November and December. Gestation lasts about 52 days, and litter size 1s from one to six pups. Young are born in burrows dug by adults in sandy soil, or in enlarged spring hare or Aardvark burrows. Births have also been known to occur in crevices, cavities amongst boulders, and occasionally, dense vegetation. Although both parents feed the pups, the female is the main provider and no helpers are found at dens. Both parents will defend the pups against potential predators. Their habit of abandoning one den for another could serve to avoid the accumulation of parasites and to confuse potential predators. Pups first begin to hunt at about 16 weeks, and become independent and disperse at the age of about five months. Communal denning has been recorded in the southern Kalahari, and a litter of eight pups found in the Free State perhaps reflects a similar situation.","Cape Foxes forage almost exclusively at night, peaking shortly after sundown and just before dawn.",,"CITES not listed. Classified as Least Concern on The [UCN Red List. Although treated as a pest across most of its range, it is partially protected in several South African provinces and is not listed as a problem species; no permit, however, is required to kill this fox in pest control operations, resulting in population reductions in some areas. Generally common to fairly abundant across much of its range, the species is considered to be stable. Population estimates are only available for South Africa’s Free State province , where average density was 0-3 foxes per km? yielding a total population estimate of 31,000 individuals. Habitat loss/changes are not a major factor influencing the conservation status of the Cape Fox. In fact, in the Western Cape Province and elsewhere, changing agricultural practices have resulted in range extensions for the species. Expansion of semi-arid karroid vegetation during the process of desertification, especially eastwards, has also resulted in range extensions of this canid.

Annual rainfall averages 100 mm per year, with a maximum of 240 mm per year. On the northern fringe of the Sahara, Ruppell’s Fox may be found in areas with up to 150 mm annual rainfall. In Morocco the general habitat offers sparse to very sparse vegetation cover, dominated by small brushes (Hammada scoparia, Panicum turgidum, Fagonia spp.) mostly concentrated in wadis (with Acacia Spp., Argania spinosa, Balanites aegyptiaca, Maerua crassifolia, and Capparis decidua trees). Ruppell’s Foxes also live in coastal areas with extremely sparse vegetation and no trees. They can survive in areas without any available water, as in central Saudi Arabia on the fringes of the Arabian Empty Quarter, in Algeria , and in the western Sahara .","Generalist predators, with a high invertebrate content in their diet, as well as rodents, lizards, snakes, birds, and wild fruits. Some studies have shown that Ruppell’s Foxes consume prey relative to availability, suggesting opportunistic feeding habits. Little is known about their feeding behavior except that they forage alone, and may scavenge at camps and permanent human settlements.","In Saudi Arabia , mating takes place from December to February, which usually coincides with the first rains after the harsh summer period. Captures of young pups have been made in early March in Saudi Arabia and in March in the western Sahara . Very young animals have been recorded in Algeria in May, and captures of young pups in Saudi Arabia peaked from July to August, following the dependency period. In Mahazat as-Sayd gestation lasts 7-8 weeks and littersize is 2-3. Young pups remain dependent on their parents for an undefined period before they venture out from the den site area. Both sexes reach sexual maturity at around 9-10 months. Dens are commonly located under slabs of rock or dug at the base of trees or bushes. In areas with few shelters the species may use very exposed dens, often in the middle of plains. Some of these burrows are dug by Honey Badgers. In open areas any disturbance induces flight; in Niger , the animals often flee from their dens when threatened. In Oman , study animals changed den sites frequently, probably as an anti-predator strategy or perhaps due to resource availability. Shallow scrapes in a packed silt substrate may offer effective cooling, and midday temperatures may be 12-15°C lower inside these dens than outside.","Mainly crepuscular and nocturnal.

In Saudi Arabia , there is currently no effective legislation for the protection of native carnivores. In Israel , the species is fully protected by law. In Morocco , Ruppell’s Foxes may be hunted as they are considered pests. Although widespread throughout the Arabian Peninsula, the speciesis limited by the large desert areas. Population density is usually low, but seems higher in areas where food is more freely available, for example near human settlements. In a fenced protected area of Saudi Arabia , density was 0-7/ km®. Lower population estimates outside the fenced reserve indicate that the species may be very vulnerable in the over-grazed, human-influenced landscape of central Arabia. Habitat loss, fragmentation and degradation, direct and indirect persecution by hunting, and indiscriminate use of poisons, appear to be the main threats. In Israel , the species is on the verge of extinction due to competitive exclusion by Red Foxes, which are expanding their range following human settlement in the Negev Desert.

Avoids dense forests, steep terrain, tall grasslands, and true deserts. The species is relatively abundant in areas of India where rainfall is low and the typical vegetation is scrub, thorn, or dry deciduous forests, or short grasslands.","Indian Foxes are omnivorous, opportunistic feeders. Their diet consists mainly of insects (e.g. crickets, winged termites, grasshoppers, ants, beetle grubs) and spiders, small rodents, including Soft-furred Field Rats ( Millardia meltada ), field mice ( Mus booduga ), and Indian Gerbils, and birds and their eggs, including indian mynahs (Acridotheres tristis), ashy-crowned finch larks (Eremopterix grisea) and gray partridges (Francolinus pondicerianus). Other prey species include ground lizards, rat snakes (Ptyas mucuosus), hedgehogs (Paraechinus nudiventris), and Indian Hares (Lepus naigricollis). Indian Foxes feed on fruits of ber (Ziziphus spp.), neem (Azadirachta indica), mango (Mangifera indica), jambu (Syizigium cumini), banyan (Ficus bengalenss), melons,fruits, and the shoots and pods of Cicer arietum. They have also been reported eating the freshly voided pellets of sheep. They forage alone.","December to January. During the breeding season, the male vocalizes intensively, mostly in early evening and early morning. The gestation period is 50-53 days and parturition occurs between January and March. Littersize is usually 2-4. Both parents bring food to the pups and guard the den, and helpers have not been observed. The parents take turns foraging and rarely is the den left unguarded. Post-natal care lasts approximately 4-5 months, after which the young disperse, usually at the onset of the monsoon (June/July in north-west India ), when food is plentiful. Dens are used primarily during the pup-rearing period, and are excavated in open habitat, never in dense vegetation. Indian Foxes will usually excavate their own dens but occasionally they will appropriate and enlarge gerbil holes. Dens consist of a mosaic of tunnels in various stages of excavation, leading to a small chamber about 0-5- 1 m below the surface where the pups are born. A den complex will usually have from two to seven holes, though as many as 43 have been recorded. The holes and tunnels of a well-used den site in Gujarat covered an area 10 x 8 m . Breeding sites are reused by breeding pairs in consecutive years. Pups are rarely moved between dens during the denning period, though once the pups become more mobile, they may use any of the numerous dens within their parents’ territory.","In most parts of their range Indian Foxes are crepuscular and nocturnal. However, they may also hunt at middayif the temperature is mild, as on rainy days.",,"CITES not listed. Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. The Indian Wildlife Protection Act (1972) prohibits hunting of all wildlife and lists the Indian Fox in Schedule II. Although the Indian Fox is widespread, it occurs at low densities throughoutits range, and populations can undergo major fluctuations in response to prey availability. Densities of breeding pairs may range from 0-15-0-1/km? during periods of peak rodent abundance to 0-01/km?® during periods of low rodent abundance. In more diverse and stable prey systems, Fox densities are more constant (0-04-0-06/km?®). In protected grasslands such as in Rollapadu Wildlife Sanctuary, Andhra Pradesh , Fox density was 1-:6/km?* and in unprotected areas only 0-4/km? in the latter area, the population declined five-fold due to an epidemic in 1995. The Indian Fox population is decreasing, due to loss of short grassland-scrub habitat to intensive agriculture and development projects, although the rate of decline remains unknown. In certain states like Gujarat , Maharashtra , and Rajasthan , Indian Fox habitat is widespread, with minimal threats, but in other states, like Karnataka and Tamil Nadu , habitats are limited and decreasing. In Tamil Nadu , humans are a major mortality factor, especially nomadic tribal people who kill foxes for their flesh, teeth, claws, and skin. People also often block fox dens with stones, and foxes are hunted using smoke, nets and dogs at dens. Indian Foxes are often killed on roads, and major highways in the semi-arid tracts are likely to become barriers to dispersal.",Acharjyo & Misra (1976) | Johnsingh (1978) | Johnsingh & Jhala (2004) | Manakadan & Rahmani (2000) | Mitchell (1977) | Mivart (1890a) | Prakash (1975) | Prater (1980) | Rahmani (1989) | Roberts (1977) | Rodgers et al.

Generally not found in areas highly degraded by human disturbance or overgrazing. Recently, Foxes have become scarce owing to precipitous population declines. On the northern Channel Islands declines are principally a consequence of hyperpredation by golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos); on those islands the foxes are more numerous in habitats with dense cover.","Island Foxes are omnivorous and feed on a wide variety of insects, vertebrates, fruits, terrestrial molluscs, and nearshore invertebrates. The relative abundance of insects, mammals, and plant material in the diet has been found to differ by habitat type , and by island, depending upon availability of food items. For example, North American Deermouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) occur at high densities on San Miguel Island, where they constitute a large proportion of Fox diet. On Santa Cruz Island, Jerusalem crickets (Stenopelmatusfuscus) are a principal prey. The fruits of the coastal prickly pear cactus ( Opuntia littoralis ) are a principal food on San Clemente Island. Bird remains in droppings are usually occur infrequently (3- 6%), except in San Miguel Island where bird remains were found in 22% (n = 208). Island Foxes primarily forage alone, by coursing back and forth through suitable habitat patches and then moving past little-used habitats to other suitable habitat patches.","Foxes breed once a year, mainly in April. Recent research suggests they may have induced ovulation, allowing for plasticity in the timing of reproduction. Litter size varies from one to five, but most litters are smaller, from one to three. Average litter size for 24 dens located on Santa Cruz was 2-2. Weaning is complete by mid- to late June and pups reach adult weight and become independent by September. Although most foxes are typically monogamous, extra-pair fertilization has been recorded: of 16 pups whose paternity was tested genetically, 25% were the result of extra-pairfertilizations. Dens consist of rock piles, dense brush, and natural cavities in the ground or under tree trunks.","Island Foxes forage mostly at night, but also during the day.",,"CITES not listed.

Rarely observed in densely wooded cerrado, floodplains, or dry or gallery forests.","Omnivorous, though the diet is mainly insects, particularly grounddwelling harvester termites (Synthermes spp. and Cornitermes spp.), recorded in 87% of feces across its geographical range. Dung beetles are consumed in great quantities when seasonally abundant. Other prey includes small mammals, grasshoppers, birds, and reptiles. Hoary Foxes tend to hunt as individuals or in loosely-knit pairs, with or without their juvenile offspring. Foraging group sizes of 3-5 were most common during periods of insect swarming. Hoary Foxes consume termites directly from the ground surface, or from the underside of dried cattle dung, which they flip over by pushing the dung along the ground at speed. Fox pups start eating insects at the age of at least two months. During the early rainy season, adult and young foxes catch flying ant and termite elates, as well as dung beetles.","In the wild, females produce litters of 4-5 offspring once a year during July and August. Pups are born in disused armadillo burrows, particularly dens of Euphractus sexcinctus . Offspring are cared for by the breeding male and female; there is no evidence that other foxes help. During late lactation, the female may visit the den a couple of times per night to nurse; in her absence, the male babysits, grooms, and guards the pups against potential predators. Post-weaning female contact declines substantially, whereas the male stays with the pups during hunting expeditions to insect patches close to the den. The estimated lactation period in the wild is three months. Juveniles of both sexes disperse when 9-10 months old and may establish home ranges adjacent to their natal territory.",Predominantly nocturnal.,,"CITES not listed.

No reliable data on population size, but considered locally abundant in the central highland cerrado biome, although populations appear smaller than those of the sympatric Crab-eating Fox, for which population estimates are similarly lacking. There is no specific hunting legislation for Hoary Foxes. The principal biome where Hoary Foxes occur is the cerrado, which is being destroyed at a rate of 3% each year, largely in the interests of agriculture (livestock and soybean). It appears that Hoary Foxes adapt to livestock pasture rich in termites and dung beetles. Breeding foxes are found in deforested wooded areas; thusit is possible that deforestation may not have a negative impact on the species. Areas of high human population density are unlikely to be suitable. Hoary Foxes are killed indiscriminately as predators of domestic fowl, although Crab-eating Foxes are probably more often the predators. Young foxes are often taken as pets. Some are killed by domestic dogs when dens are located in peri-urban areas.

Northern Gray Foxes occur in semi-arid areas of the south-western USA and northern Mexico where cover is sufficient. They also live at the margins of some urban areas.","Omnivorous. During winter, prey consists largely of rabbits (Sylvilagus spp-) and rodents. In spring and summer it diversifies to include insects (e.g. grasshoppers), birds, and sometimes carrion. Northern Gray Foxes also feed on natural fruits and nuts, often consuming more of these foods in the fall as their availability increases.","Northern Gray Foxes reach sexual maturity at ten months of age, although not all females breed in their first year. Breeding generally occurs from January to April, with gestation lasting about 60 days. Litter size average is 4, ranging from 1-10. Pups accompany adults on foraging expeditions at three months and forage independently at four months. Pups are fed mainly by females, but males may also participate in parental care. Northern Gray Foxes give birth and rear their pups in earthen dens, which they either dig themselves or modify from other species. They will also den in wood and brush piles, rock crevices, hollow logs, hollows under shrubs, and under abandoned buildings. They may even den in hollows of trees up to nine meters above the ground.

Few details of habitat preferences are known.,"The Sechuran Fox is a generalist omnivore that preferentially consumesvertebrate prey or carrion when available, but often depends predominantly on seeds or seed pods. Feces collected during late winter and early spring in the inland Sechuran Desert contained mainly the remnants of undigested seeds or seed pods of algarrobo (Prosopis juliflora), zapote (Capparis scabrida) and vizcacho (C. avicennifolia). The syrupy matrix surrounding the seeds may be the actual source of nourishment. In a germination experiment, seeds recovered from feces sprouted earlier than those gathered from the ground, suggesting that the foxes not only act as seed dispersers, but affect the ability of the seeds to germinate rapidly when sporadic rains occur. Fox droppings along the coast contained crabs and several bird species. Following El Nino rains, fox droppings revealed a dramatic dietary shift to grasshoppers and mice (Paralomys gerbillus) as these prey became more abundant. In central Peru , the main summer foods were insects, scorpions (Carica candicans), fruits, and rodents. The lack of standing water in the inland desert habitat suggests that the foxes can survive without drinking. However, they may lick condensation from vegetation on foggy mornings. No food caching has been recorded.",Few details of breeding behavior known. Births are reported to occur primarily in October and November.,"Primarily nocturnal. Radio-telemetry tracking indicated that individuals emerged from their rocky daytime sleeping dens before sunset and remained active through most of the night before re-entering the dens at dawn.

While the speciesis easily observed in rural areas and disturbed environments from the states of Piura to La Libertad in Peru , large population fluctuations due to disease and persecution are causes for concern. Footprint surveys in Piura , Peru , show an average of 12-6 foxes per km. The Sechuran Fox is uncommon in Ecuador . In Peru , hunting outside established areas and trade has been prohibited since 2000, but it has proven difficult to control trade in rural areas. The most important threats are the market for handicrafts and amulets that are made of Sechuran Fox parts, and persecution because of damage to livestock. In Peru , the attitude of rural inhabitants to the species is antagonistic (68-3% of correspondents) or indifferent (317%). The stated reasons for favoring persecution were predation on domestic fowl and guinea pigs (65% of correspondents), the consumption of vegetables or stored goods (13:3%), and belief that goat predation occurs (10%). The Sechuran Fox also faces some pressure in agricultural zones and from urbanization and habitat degradation; habitat loss is considered the principle threatto this species in Ecuador .",Asa & Cossios (2004) | Asa & Wallace (1990) | Birdseye (1956) | Cabrera (1931) | Centro de Datos para la Conservacion (1989) | Huey (1969) | Langguth (1975),https://zenodo.org/record/6331197/files/figure.png

It prefers open habitats, tall grass plains and sub-humid to dry habitats, but is also common in ridges, dry scrublands and open woodlands. In drier habitats in the southerly and easterly parts of its range, the speciesis replaced by the South American Gray Fox. Where its range overlaps with that of the Crab-eating Fox, the Pampas Fox selects more open areas. Apparently it has been able to adapt to the habitat alterations caused by extensive cattle breeding and agricultural activities.","Like most other medium-sized foxes, the Pampas Fox is a generalist and adaptable carnivore. Its diet shows great geographic variation and may include both wild and domestic vertebrates (particularly rodents and birds), fruit, insects, carrion, and garbage. Based on stomach contents, wild mammals and sheep appeared to be the two most common food items in Uruguay , while in La Pampa Province , Argentina , European Hares and rodents were the most common food items, followed by birds and carrion. In Buenos Aires Province , Argentina , there was a high frequency of rodents and birds, but also of insects, fruits, and crabs. Seasonal and local variations in diet are likely connected to variations in food availability. The Pampas Fox is a solitary and opportunistic carnivore. Large, highly concentrated food resources (i.e. large mammal carcasses) may cause several individuals to gather, possibly beyond the borders of normal home ranges. Food caching behavior has been observed, apparently related to an increase in the availability of rodents.","In central Argentina , pups are born from October to December. Gestation lasts 55-60 days, and litter sizes range from 3-5. Dens may be located in a variety of shelters, such as a hole at the base of a tree trunk, an armadillo ( Dasypodidae spp.) den, or among rocks. Pups are frequently moved to a new location. The young stay at the den for the first three months. Both pair mates have been observed to guard the den, and males provide food to pups and females at the den. Females may breed at 8-12 months of age.","Forages both day and night, although activity is mainly nocturnal in areas with severe hunting pressure.",,"CITES Appendix II. Classified as Least Concern on The [UCN Red List and the Argentina Red List of Mammals. Abundant or common in most areas. In Argentina trade was prohibited in 1987. However,it continues to be hunted. In Uruguay and Paraguay the species is protected by law. In Argentina and southern Brazil the Pampas Fox was considered an important predator of sheep and goats, and was consequently persecuted by livestock ranchers. The Pampas Fox is currently threatened by the official implementation of control measures (promoted by ranchers) and the use of non-selective methods of capture. Fox control by government agencies involves the use of bounty systems without any thorough studies on population abundance or the real damage thatthis species may cause. In rural areas, direct persecution is also common, even where hunting is illegal. Most of the species’ range in the Pampas region has suffered massive habitat alteration due to extensive cattle ranching and agriculture. Although apparently able to withstand hunting pressure and habitat loss, the sum of these threats may nevertheless eventually cause the depletion of fox populations. Rural residents have traditionally hunted the Pampas Fox forits fur, an important source of income. Hunting pressure has resulted in diminished populations in north-west Argentina . In Uruguay , illegal trade is still widespread. Pampas Foxes are also frequently struck by cars in some areas.",Barquez et al.

South American Gray Foxes generally inhabit plains and low mountains, but they have been reported to occur as high as 3500-4000 m . Although they occur in a variety of habitats, they prefer shrubby open areas. In Chile , they hunt more commonly in flat open patches of low scrub. In Chilean Patagonia, their typical habitat consists of shrubby steppe composed of coiron (Festuca spp., Stipa spp.) and nires (Nothofagus antarctica). Burning and destruction of forests for sheep farming seems to have been advantageous for these foxes. In Torres del Paine National Park, 58% of twelve individuals monitored showed preferential use of matorral shrubland or Nothofagus thicket habitat within their home ranges. In the Mendoza desert, Argentina , they prefer the lower levels of shrubby sand dunes rather than higher sections. They tolerate a variety of climates, including hot and dry areas such as the Atacama coastal desert in northern Chile (less than 2 mm average annual rainfall, 22°C mean annual temperature), the humid, temperate Valdivian forest ( 2000 mm average annual rainfall, 12°C mean annual temperature), and the cold environment of Tierra del Fuego (c. 400 mm average annual rainfall, 7°C mean annual temperature).","South American Gray Foxes are omnivorous generalists, feeding on a variety of foods, including mammals, arthropods, birds, reptiles, fruit, and carrion. Fruits ingested include berries of Cryptocarya alba and Lithraea caustica in Chile , pods of Prosopis spp., and the berry-like fruits of Prosopanche americana and of several Cactaceae in Argentina . A tendency to carnivory is apparent, however, since vertebrates, especially rodents, are reported to be the most important prey in most studies. Small mammals were the most frequently occurring vertebrate prey in most sites in the Chilean matorral and in the temperate rainforests of southern Chile . In Torres del Paine National Park, the European Hare was the most represented vertebrate prey, followed by carrion and akodontine rodents. In the Argentine Patagonian steppe, carrion was the most important food item in 42 stomachs collected in winter (representing 62% of biomass ingested), followed by hares and cricetine rodents. In Argentina’s southern Patagonia, diet also consisted primarily of carrion, followed by birds, rodents, and fruit. Diet included invertebrates, carrion, birds, and rodents in Tierra del Fuego . In the harshest habitats ofits range, the foxes’ diets include increasingly higher proportions of non-mammal food as small mammal availability decreases. Lizards were the most consumed vertebrate prey in winter, the season of lowest small mammal availability in coastal northern Chile . Small-mammal consumption decreased from autumn to summer, and fruit consumption increased. In central Chile , berries appeared in 52% of the droppings (n = 127) collected in autumn, while in spring, when small mammal availability is highest, berries were present in only 18% of the feces (n = 62). In Mendoza (Monte desert), fruit was represented in 35% of feces (n = 116), followed by small mammals (19% frequency of occurrence). Foraging occurs mostly in open areas. Although hunting groups of up to 4-5 individuals have been reported, South American Gray Foxes mostly hunt solitarily, except perhaps at the end of the breeding season, when juveniles may join the parents in search of food. In Torres del Paine National Park, the most common foraging behavior consisted of slow walking, with abrupt, irregular turns through low vegetation. The same report noted that prey appear to be located by sound, sight, and smell. Mice are captured with a sudden leap or by rapidly digging holes. Scavenging is common, as well as defecation on and around Guanaco (Lama guanicoe) and domestic goat carcasses. Caching behavior has also been reported.","Mating occurs in August and September, the gestation period is 53-58 days and 4-6 pups are born in October. Dens are located in a variety of natural and manmade places such as a hole at the base of a shrub or in culverts under a dirt road The pups may be moved to a new location during the nursing period. During the first few days the mother rarely leaves the den and the male provisions her with food. Pups are cared for by both parents on an approximately equal time basis. Young foxes start to emerge from the den when they are about one month old, and start to disperse ( 8-65 km ) at 6-7 months of age. Two interesting phenomena concerning breeding behavior may occur: litters of two females combine (associated with polygyny) and the presence of female helpers. Both seem to be related to food availability and litter size. Female helpers contribute by bringing provisioning food to the den and increasing anti-predator vigilance.","Direct observations and prey activity patterns suggest that South American Gray Foxes are crepuscular, although they are commonly seen during the day. Radio-tracking showed that they were primarily nocturnal in Torres del Paine National Park, whereas they were active during both day and night in Reserva Nacional Las Chinchillas.",,"CITES Appendix II.

Reported to have expanded their range in Tierra del Fuego since being introduced there: in 1996 their density was estimated at 1 per km®. Hunting them and fur trading are legal in Argentine Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego . All Chilean populations are currently protected by law, except for those from Tierra del Fuego . The main threat to South American Gray Fox populations in the past was commercial hunting for fur. Hunting intensity has apparently declined in recentyears. Illegal killing still occurs in some regions,as the foxes are perceived to be voracious predators of small livestock, poultry and game. The usual means of hunting are by shooting, dogs, poison, snares, and foothold traps.

Evidence of a new population was foud recently at Punta Chan Chan, N of Valdivia.",,"Generally believed to be a forest obligate species found only in southern temperate rainforests. They inhabit dense Valdivian forest, which is very moist all year round. The forest is dominated by fruit-bearing trees in the family Mirtaceae ; there are a few native conifers and several species of broad-leaved evergreens. Radio-tracking along a gradient of disturbance on Chiloé indicated that, in decreasing order, foxes use old-growth Valdivian forest followed by secondary forest followed by pastures and openings; about 70% of home ranges comprised old-growth forest. However, when compared to the availability of each forest gradient, foxes showed preference for secondary forest and avoided old growth. On the Pacific coast of Chiloé, Darwin’s Foxes live in a fragmented environment of coastal sand dunes and dense evergreen forest. On the northern part of the island, they use a relatively flat, fragmented landscape of broadleaf forest and cow pasture. The mainland population uses dense forest; animals are found with decreasing frequency in dense monkey-puzzle tree-southern beech (Araucaria-Nothofagus spp.) forest, open Nothofagus forest and open pasture, respectively.","Omnivorous, with a broad diet, and highly opportunistic. These traits facilitate its survival in a highly fluctuating environment with low prey availability. Fecal analysis showed that the mainland population ate primarily small mammals, followed, in decreasing levels of importance, by reptiles, insects, birds, and arachnids. The proportions of these prey classes fluctuated strongly according to season. Berries were also included in the diet, occurring in about. 20% of the feces. On the mainland Darwin’s Foxes rely heavily on the seeds of monkey-puzzle trees from March to May. On Chiloé,fecal analysis revealed that insects were the most abundant food item in the diet during the warm season, followed by amphibians, mammals, birds, and reptiles; 49% offeces contained seeds. During late summer and fall, the diet was almost entirely fruits of Mirtaceae trees. Foxes may be considered a key species because of their role in dispersing the seeds of forest plants. An experiment indicated that a high percent age of the seeds of one tree species ( Amomyrtus luma ) collected from feces germinated underfield conditions. Darwin’s Foxes also eat carrion in small amounts, as evidenced by the remains (e.g. hair) of sheep, pigs, cattle, and horses in feces. Local settlers reported that lone foxes also kill Southern Pudu deer (Pudu puda; about 10 kg in weight) by biting their ankles and then the throat. In addition, coastal foxes feed on shellfish and shorebirds, and have been observed feeding on large brown algae on the beach.","On the mainland, lactating females have been caught in October and pups have been documented leaving the den area and venturing out with both parents in December. Litter size is estimated to be 2-3 pups. Weaning occurs in February. During this period the female spends relatively less time with the pups, and a greater proportion of their interactions are agonistic, whereas the male spends more time playing with and grooming the pups. A den was located in a rock cavity ( 2 m deep) in Araucaria—Nothofagus forest with a bamboo understory, and a small pup was found denning in a hollow rotten log. During mating, males and females are together for a few days. During the first few weeks after parturition, females move little and apparently stay in the den.","Darwin’s Foxes seem to concentrate their activity during the daytime in forested areas. In Nahuelbuta, they forage mainly at night, when the sympatric and larger South American Gray Fox is less active. They have also been observed hunting ducks at midday in a coastal marsh.",,"CITES Appendix II. Classified as Critically Endangered on The IUCN Red List. Population size is currently estimated as less than 250 mature individuals with most of the foxes occurring in Chiloé Island. Protected by Chilean law since 1929, but enforcement is not always possible and some poaching occurs. The conservation status is “rare” on the mainland and “vulnerable” on Chiloé Island. More recently, Darwin’s Fox has been considered as “critical”, becoming the second most urgent Chilean terrestrial mammal conservation priority. The mainland population is reported to be vulnerable and its survival uncertain if current environmental trends continue. Although the species is protected in Nahuelbuta National Park, foxes are exposed to substantial mortality risks when they move to lower, unprotected private areas in search of milder conditions during the winter. Some foxes even breed in these areas. Unleashed dogs are common both on Chiloé and in Nahuelbuta and represent a significant conservation threat. Dogs have been reported to attack and kill foxes and are also vectors of potentially fatal diseases. The island population, being protected in Chiloé National Park, appears to be relatively safe. This 430 km ® protected area encompasses most of the pristine rainforest on the island. However, although the park appears to have a sizable fox population, foxes also live in the surrounding areas where substantial forest cover remains.

The Culpeo uses the entire range of habitat moisture gradients from the dry desert to broad-leaved rainforest. In the Andes of Peru , Chile , Bolivia , and Argentina it reaches elevations of up to 4800 m , where it occupies colder and dryer environments than any other South American canid.","Diet includes wild ungulates, domestic sheep (northern Patagonia), European Hares (Lepus europeus), European Rabbits, small mammals, lizards, birds, and insects. Although it is an opportunistic predator, the Culpeo is considered more carnivorous and a consumer of larger mammalian prey than the other South American foxes. Most trophic studies found seasonal differences in diet composition, probably in response to prey availability. In Argentine Patagonia, Culpeos showed a preference for hares and selected among rodent species for those that may be more vulnerable. Culpeos in central Chile selected the largest small mammals available. Although the bulk of the diet consists of animal prey, Culpeos are often described as consumers offruits and berries and are therefore thought to disperse seeds of a variety of plant species. Highest fruit consumption occurs when small mammals are the least abundant. Culpeos tend to forage solitarily. Their foraging activity may be influenced by the nocturnal habits of their main prey, but also by persecution.","In the Patagonian steppe of Argentina , male Culpeos produce sperm between June and mid-October (early winter to early spring). Females are monoestrous and mating occurs from the beginning of August through October. Gestation is 58 days. Based on embryo counts, estimated mean litter size is 5-2 (range 3-8). Neonates weigh about 170 g . Juveniles reach adult size within seven months and can reproduce during the first year. Although the sex ratio of 253 individuals was skewed in favor of males in the Neuquén population, some 30 years later the sex ratio approached parity, as expected for intensively hunted populations.","In Argentina , Magallanes, and the Chilean desert, and highland Peru (where it is intensively persecuted) the Culpeo is almost completely nocturnal. This contrasts with the diurnal activity shown in north-central Chile , where it is protected. Culpeos have been recorded moving linear distances of about 7 km in north-western Patagonia, but desert-dwelling foxes in northern Chile have been recorded moving three times as far.",,"CITES Appendix II. Classified as Least Concern on The [UCN Red Last. In Chile the species is considered Insufficiently Known and the subspecies P. ¢. lycoides is considered Endangered. Despite being similarly decreed as “endangered” in Argentina , due to the number of Culpeo pelts traded during the 1970s and early 1980s, national trade and export of this product has remained legal. Culpeos appear to withstand intense hunting levels and still maintain viable regional populations. Recent estimates reported densities of 0-2-1-3 individuals/km? in north-western Patagonia, Argentina , and 0-3-1-3 individuals/km? in Chile . Hunting has been banned since 1980), although law enforcement is not strict. Although Culpeo fur exports were banned in Bolivia in 1986, the species is not protected in that country. Culpeos are persecuted to reduce predation on livestock and poultry. They prey on newborn lambs and account for an estimated 60% of the attacks by predators in Patagonia. Predation by feral and domestic dogs may threaten Culpeos in some areas, and road kills occur frequently in Argentina .",Bustamante et al. (1992) | Cofré & Marquet (1999) | Corley et al.

Sightings often associated with rivers and creeks, and there are reliable reports of Short-eared Dogs swimming in rivers. Records are very rare in areas with significant human disturbance, such as near towns or in agricultural areas. It is unclear whether the Short-eared Dog is able to utilize habitats outside wet lowland forests, although it has been documented at 1200 m in the Ecuadoran Andes at the edge of cloud forest.","A generalist carnivore with fish the most important item in their diet, according to one study at Cocha Cashu, Peru (presentin 28% of 21 scat samples). Insects (mainly Coleoptera ) were the second most frequently occurring item (17% of samples). Mammal remains, including agouti (Dasyprocta spp.), marsupials, and small rodents) were present in 13% ofthe scats and the remains offruits were found in 10%. Fruits of the palm Euterpe precatoria were found germinating in two scats, suggesting that Short-eared Dogs may facilitate seed dispersal for some species. Short-eared Dogs have been reported to eat fallen Brosimum fruits, and the Cofan Indians of Ecuadorreport that they are attracted to fallen bananas. Close to 4% of droppings contained the remains of frogs, including Osteocephalus taurinus, and this dietary habit is supported by independent observations elsewhere. Crabs (10-3% of samples), birds (10-3%), reptiles (3-4%), and vegetable fiber (3-4%) were other components of the diet at Cocha Cashu. The Short-eared Dog has been reported hunting alone and in pairs.","Breeding time is not known precisely, but pups have been found throughout the species’ range from April to December, suggesting that parturition occurs in the dry season. Three dens have been found inside hollow logs, one of them containing two adults and two pups, and another with the female and two pups. Another den containing three pups was found in a Lowland Paca burrow.","Mostly diurnal, although it has also been photographed at night walking on trails of Madidi National Park, Bolivia , and one animal was captured in Colombia swimming after a Lowland Paca (Cuniculus paca) in a river at 03:00 h.",,"Classified as Near Threatened on The IUCN Red List. The species is on the Brazilian list of endangered species and on the preliminary list of Colombian endangered species. The Short-eared Dog is notoriously rare, and sightings are uncommon across its range. However, this may not always have been the case; the first biologists to study the species found it relatively easy to trap during mammal surveys in Amazonian Peru in 1969, and specimens were collected around the same time in Peru's Manu Basin (now Manu National Park), suggesting that the species was also relatively common in that area at that time. For unknown reasons, it appears to have temporarily vanished from the region between 1970 and 1987. Over the last decade, it appears that it may be recovering in south Peru and east Ecuador , with increasing numbers of sightings in recent years at both sites. Between 1987 and 1999, biologists working in the Peruvian department of Madre de Dios, mostly in the vicinity of Cocha Cashu Biological Station, reported 15 encounters with Short-eared Dogs. Threats include diseases from domestic dogs and habitat loss. There are no reports of widespread persecution of the species. An ongoing distribution survey suggests that the Short-eared Dog is rare throughout its range and threatened by the large-scale forest conversion underway in Amazonia. There are no known reports of the species being hunted or trapped for its fur. The species avoids developed areas, and there are no known cases of road kills, so the impact of vehicles on population numbers is probably minimal.",Defler & Santacruz (1994) | Emmons & Feer (1997) | Grimwood (1969) | Hershkovitz (1961) | Leite & Williams (2004) | Nowak (1999) | Pacheco et al.

In the western part of the range, Corsac Foxes occur in low-grass steppe, avoiding dense and tall-grass steppes. They also occur in sandy habitats and shrubland semi-deserts, and in favorable years, in forested steppes. They avoid areas where depth of snow exceeds c. 15 cm , preferring areas where the snow is either shallower or highly compressed. Corsac Foxes appear to depend on ground squirrels (Spermophilus spp.) and marmots (Marmota spp.) for food and shelter (the burrows being enlarged and used for daytime refuge).","Generally opportunistic, with a highly variable diet throughout its range that probably changes in accordance with availability. The bulk of the diet often includes the most common rodents of an area. Birds, reptiles (lizards, snakes and young tortoises), and insects are also frequently consumed, especially in summer, as well as small amounts of vegetation (including fruit and seeds). During winter and periods of low prey abundance, scavenged Gray Wolf kills and carcasses of wild and domestic ungulates are a major source of food in some areas. Typical prey in western Siberia includes voles (Microtus gregalis, Arvicola terrestris), lemmings (Lagurus spp.), ground squirrels (Spermophilus spp.), and jerboas (Allactaga spp.) Common winter prey also often includes Arctic Hares (Lepus timidus) and birds such as gray partridges (Perdix perdix) and snow buntings (Pleptrophenax nivalis). In the forest-steppe of Kazakhstan , the diet consists primarily of lemmings and sousliks. On the Ustyurt Plateau and in Turkmenistan the main prey are gerbils ( Meriones spp. , Rhombomys opimus); in Transbaikalia and Mongolia , the main prey species are gerbils ( Meriones spp. ), jerboas (Allactaga spp. and Dipus spp.), hamsters (Cricetulus spp. and Phodopus spp.), Brandt's Voles (Lasiopodomys brandltii), Siberian Marmots (Marmota sibirica), and pikas (Ochotona spp.). The foxes are solitary foragers, although near carrion or the remains of wolf kills several Corsacs may gather together. The foxes hunt by stalking prey and making sudden short-distance attacks. They locate ground-nesting birds and other small prey by sound and smell. Despite their small size they can kill prey up to the size of young marmots, hares, ducks, pheasants, and geese.","Across the range of the species, mating takes place from January to early March. There is only one litter per year and gestation varies from 52 to 60 days. The earliest birth time is mid-March, most births occurring in April. Average litter size in Kazakhstan was 5-5 (range = 2-10). Pups usually emerge from dens in mid-May. At 28 days they start eating meat. The male takes an active part in parental care by feeding the young, and in favorable years helpers may assist with feeding and guarding the young. Pups reach adult size at four to five months, and in captivity sexual maturity is reached by nine months. They disperse by the end of summer, but do not venture far from their natal range, and some are likely to return to stay over the autumn-winter season.","Corsac Foxes are active mainly at night. Hunting starts in the evening and continues through the first part of the night, with a second peak of activity before dawn. Sometimes they are also active in daytime, especially during the summer months.",,"CITES notlisted. Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. Current population status and the nature of major threats is unknown in most regions. Corsac Foxes were once considered ubiquitous across Central Asia, but notable declines have occurred in recent years following the collapse of the former Soviet Union. In Russia the Corsac Fox is rare in most regions, but relatively common in western Siberia and Transbaikalia. The species is common between the Volga and Ural rivers, but probably declining in Turkmenistan , Kazakhstan , Mongolia , and northern China . Corsac Foxes are rare in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan and the south-western portion of their range. In many countries, hunting them is legal during certain seasons, but enforcement of wildlife laws and regulations rarely occurs. Over-hunting and illegal poaching (even in protected areas) remains the most significant threat to the species. In Mongolia , increased hunting for furs in recent years has depleted populations throughout the country and led the species’ listing as “near threatened” in 2006.",Allen (1938) | Chirkova (1952) | Geptner et al.

Natural habitat is dry, mixed landscape, with mosaics of scrub, woodland and farmland. They are also abundant on moorlands, mountains, deserts, sand dunes and farmland from sea level to 4500 m . Red Foxes flourish in urban areas, where they are most common in low-density residential suburbs and less common in areas dominated by industry or commerce. In many habitats, foxes appear to be closely associated with humans, even thriving in intensive agricultural areas. Also in large cities, including Washington DC , London, Paris, and Stockholm .","Adaptable and opportunistic omnivores, with a diet ranging from invertebrates (e.g. earthworms and beetles) to mammals, birds, fruit, and carrion. As predators, foxes typically kill birds and mammals up to about 3-5 kg . They cache food that is in excess of their requirements and have a highly developed memory for locations of hoards. They scavenge in rural areas (e.g. on deer and sheep carcasses in Europe and Canada , which may be the major food source in upland areas in winter), and in urban areas (on bird-feeding tables, compost heaps, and refuse). They are independent and thus generally solitary foragers, although individuals may forage in close proximity where resources are clumped.","Males are seasonally fecund. Mating occurs between December and February (June to October in Australia ); the onset of breeding is correlated with day length and so starts earlier at more southerly latitudes. Following a gestation period of 49-55 days, births occur from March to May. Lactation lasts for four weeks, and the pups are fully weaned at 6-8 weeks. Sexual maturity is reached at 9-10 months. The proportion of breeding females in the group, andlitter size (3-12 young perlitter), varies with food availability. Fox populations that are dense relative to food resources are generally less productive than those that are less dense. A single litter per year is the norm. In high-density populations where interactions with the dominant female are high, subordinate females do not usually breed. The male provides food to the lactating female, who is generally confined to the den prior to weaning. Food is provided for the pups by both parents. Non-breeding females may also feed, groom, and tend pups and have been known to adopt orphaned pups. If two females breed within a group, they may share a den and litters may be communally suckled.","Foraging is mainly nocturnal and crepuscular, although more diurnal where undisturbed.",,"CITES notlisted.

The subspecies griffithi, montana, and pusilla (= leucopus) are listed as CITES Appendix III ( India ). Most countries and/or states where trapping or hunting occurs have regulated closed versus open seasons and restrictions on methods of capture. In the EU, Canada , and the Russian Federation , trapping methods are regulated. Red Fox density is highly variable, ranging within the UK from 0-025 individuals/km? in Scotland to 30/km? in some urban areas where food is superabundant. Density in mountainous rural areas of Switzerland is 3/km?. In northern boreal forests and Arctic tundra, the foxes occur at densities of 0-1/km?, and in southern Ontario , Canada at 1/km? Threats include habitat degradation and fragmentation, exploitation and persecution, and government policies. Other threats come from local, national, or international socio-economic and political factors, such as increasing human population and thus increasing development.

Birds and their eggs are also consumed, as are plant materials, including prickly pear cactus fruit, wild plums, and sunflower seeds, which are consumed relatively frequently but most often in relatively small amounts. Swift Foxes are mostly solitary hunters. Caching of food has been observed.","Primarily monogamous, although additional female helpers are occasionally observed at den sites. Swift Foxes are monoestrous and the timing of breeding (December to March) is dependent upon latitude. The mean gestation period is 51 days and average litter sizes of 2-4-5-7 have been reported. In Colorado , litter sizes were greater for mated pairs with helpers than for those without. Pups open their eyes at 10-15 days, emerge from the natal den after approximately one month, and are weaned at 6-7 weeks of age. Both members of the pair provide for the young, and juveniles remain with the adults for 4-6 months. Swift Foxes are among the most burrowdependent canids and depend on dens throughout the year. They will excavate their own dens and modify the burrows of other species. Dens serve several functions, such as providing a refuge from predators, protection from extreme climate conditions in both summer and winter, and shelter for raising young.","Swift Foxes forage throughout the night, and show some crepuscular activity. They will hunt diurnal species such as birds and ground squirrels in the summer.",,"CITES not listed. Classified as Least Concern on The [UCN Red List. The Swift Fox has been down-listed from “extirpated” to “endangered” in Canada as a result of reintroduction programs. Following their extirpation by 1938, reintroduction releases since 1983 have established a small Swift Fox population in Alberta , Saskatchewan and Montana , which now constitutes the northern extent of the species’ range. In the USA , the species was cited as “warranted, but precluded” from endangered status under the federal Endangered Species Act. Swift Foxes are primarily prairie specialists, and conversion of grassland to cropland threatens to reduce population sizes and further fragment populations. The conversion of native grassland prairies has been implicated as one of the most important factors in the contraction of the Swift Fox range. Landscape alteration likely influences local and seasonal prey availability, increases risk of predation on Swift Foxes, and leads to competition with other predators such as the Coyote and Red Fox. In Canada , expansion of the oil and gas industry and associated road development are impacting previously isolated prairie areas. Greater urbanization coupled with Coyote control may facilitate Red Fox expansion, which could lead to the competitive exclusion of Swift Foxes in established prairie areas. Landowners who are attempting to protect their livestock from Coyote depredation use poisons illegally and Swift Foxes readily consume such baits.",Andersen et al.

Sub-Arctic maritime habitat in the Aleutian island chain, Bering Sea Islands, Commander Islands, and coastal Iceland .","The Arctic Fox is an opportunistic predator and scavenger. In most inland areasit is heavily dependent on fluctuating rodent populations. Main prey include Lemmings, both Lemmus spp. and Dicrostonyx spp. In Fennoscandia, L. lemmus was the main prey in summer (85% frequency of occurrence in feces) followed by birds ( Passeriformes, Galliformes, and Caridriiformes , 34%) and Reindeer (Rangifer tarandus, 21%). In winter, ptarmigan and grouse ( Lagopus spp.) are common prey, in addition to rodents and Reindeer. Changes in Fox populations have been observed to follow those of their main prey in three- to five-year cycles. Foxes living near icefree coasts have access to inland prey and also sea birds, seal carcasses, fish, and invertebrates connected to the marine environment, leading to relatively stable food availability and a more generalist strategy. In late winter and summer, foxes found in coastal Iceland feed on seabirds (Uria aalge, U. lomvia), seal carcasses, and marine invertebrates. Inland foxes rely more on Ptarmigan in winter, and migrant birds, such as geese and waders, in summer. In certain areas, foxes rely on colonies of arctic geese, which can dominate their diet locally. Arctic Foxes forage singly, presumably the most efficient foraging technique in view of the species’ main prey base of rodents and birds. When food is abundant, they cache food forlater use. Caches can contain single prey items or a variety of items, and sometimes include lemmings or goose eggs.","Mating occurs between February and May and births take place from April to July. Gestation lasts 51-54 days and pup weight at birth is 80-85 g , but may be lower in larger litters. Litter size varies with food availability, being larger in areas with rodents. Recorded mean litter sizes at weaning varied from 2-4 (St. Paul Island) to 7-1 ( Russia ). On WrangelIsland, Russia , in years with high lemming abundance, up to 19 pups per litter have been observed. The ability of Arctic Foxes to produce large litters is facilitated by their access to large and relatively safe dens. Den sites are large, with complex burrow systems, and the largest dens are preferred for breeding. These may have up to 150 entrances and are usually situated on elevated mounds, river banks or ridges. Good denning sites lie above the permafrost layer, accumulate comparatively little winter snow and are sun-exposed, often facing south. The average lifespan of dens in the Canadian tundra has been estimated at 330 years. Some are used repeatedly, year after year, others infrequently. Pup rearing is confined to the snow-free period from June to September, after which the young gradually become independent. Lactation generally lasts 8-10 weeks. Growth rate from weaning in early July to late August has been recorded at 30-34 g /day. Foxes reach sexual maturity at ten months.","Arctic Foxes remain active year round. They are primarily nocturnal, but exhibit flexible activity patterns, often in accordance with main prey species.",,"CITES not listed. Classified as Least Concern on The [UCN Red List. The Arctic Fox, however, is regionally threatened in Sweden (“endangered”), Finland (“critical”) and mainland Norway (“endangered”). In 1983, following the introduction of mange caused by ear canker mites (Otodectes cynotis) transmitted by dogs, the Mednyi Island foxes were listed in the Russian Red Data Book. The world population of Arctic Foxes is on the order of several hundred thousand animals. In most areas, population status is believed to be good. The species is common in the tundra of Russia , Canada , coastal Alaska, Greenland , and Iceland . Exceptions are Fennoscandia, Mednyi Island ( Russia ), and the Pribilof Islands, where populations are at critically low levels. On the Pribilof Islands, fox populations appear to be declining further. In most of its range, the Arctic Fox is not protected. However, the species and its dens have received total legal protection in Sweden since 1928, in Norway since 1930, and in Finland since 1940. In Europe, the Arctic Fox is a priority species under the Actions by the Community relating to the Environment (ACE) and is therefore given full protection. On St. Paul Island the declining population currently has no legal protection. In Norway ( Svalbard ), Greenland , Canada , Russia , and Alaska, trapping is limited to licensed trappers operating in a defined trapping season. The enforcement of trapping laws appears to be uniformly good. In Iceland , bounty hunting takes place over most of the country outside nature reserves. Hunting for fur has long been a major mortality factor for the Arctic Fox; however, the decline of the fur industry has reduced the threat of over-exploitation for most populations. In some areas gene swamping by farm-bred Blue Foxes may threaten native populations. There can also be indirect threats such as diseases and organochlorine contaminants, or direct persecution, as occurs on St. Paul Island. Misinformation as to the origin of Arctic Foxes on the Pribilofs continues to foster negative attitudes and the long-term persistence of this endemic subspecies is in jeopardy.",Angerbjorn | Hersteinsson & Tannerfeldt (2004) | Angerbjorn | Stroman & Becker (1997) | Angerbjorn | Tannerfeldt | Bjarvall et al.

The range of Bat-eared Foxes overlaps almost completely with that of termites of the Hodotermes and Microhodotermes genera that prevail in their diet. In East Africa Bat-eared Foxes are common in open grassland and woodland boundaries, but not on short-grass plains. Those areas occupied by Bateared Foxes usually contain more harvester termite (1. mossambicus) foraging holes and dung from migratory ungulates where beetles are likely to be found.","Insects are the primary food sources in open grassland and woodland edge habitats. Harvester termites and beetles are typically the most commonly consumed prey items. Diet is supplemented by orthopterans, beetle larvae, and ants. In open shrub savannahs, arachnids and fruit (consumed seasonally) may be among the more common food items. Small mammals, birds, eggs, and reptiles are eaten sporadically in southern Africa, but rarely in eastern Africa. There 1s seasonal variation in the proportion of particular taxa consumed: in the Serengeti dung beetles are the main source of food during the rainy season, when termite activity is reduced. When both beetles and termites are scarce, Bat-eared Foxes will dig up beetle larvae from the ground. Harvester termites and dung beetles are more abundant in areas inhabited by clusters of Bat-eared Fox families, and local differences in H. mossambicus density are inversely related to territory size. Although Fox water requirements may be met by the high water content of their insect prey or by berries during the summer, water is nevertheless a critical resource during lactation. Groups forage as a unit. Foraging techniques depend on prey type , but food is often located by walking slowly, nose close to the ground and ears cocked forward. Prey is detected mostly by sound and often excavated by digging. Foraging and feeding rates are higher when feeding on termite patches than on more dispersed insects. When feeding on termite patches, group members feed closely together, but when feeding on beetles, beetle larvae or grasshoppers, they can forage up to 200 m apart.","Bat-eared Foxes become sexually mature at 8-9 months of age. Pair-bonding and mating occur from July to September, and involve up to ten copulations per day for several days. Copulatory ties last about four minutes, and are followed by post-copulatory play. Foxes have one litter per year. Births occur between October and December, following a gestation period of 60-75 days. Litter size ranges from 1-6, and neonates weigh 99-142 g . Dens are excavated or adapted from abandoned dens of other mammals, e.g. Spring hare, Aardvark, and even termite mounds and warthog (Phacochoerus spp.) holes. Dens can be located in clusters and may have several entrances, chambers, and tunnels. Small pups nurse inside the den and are sometimes moved between dens. They first emerge for brief periods when they are 8-12 days old. Dens are carefully maintained throughout the year and often used for generations. Parental care such as grooming, playing, and guarding against predators is mostly the responsibility of males. Female investment during lactation is high compared to other canids, and their insectivorous diet prevents mothers and/or pups from being provisioned directly. However, the high level of male parental care enables females to maximize their foraging time, compensating for the fact that their nutritional intake 1s limited to small, dispersed food items. Weaning (at 10-15 weeks) occurs after the first rains and the subsequent flush of insects. In Serengeti, the Bat-eared Fox commonly exhibits polygyny, communal breeding, and indiscriminate allosuckling. The number of pups raised averages 2-6, but in extended family units with more than one breeding female it averages 3-6. Sharing male partners enables additional breeding females to sustain the energetic costs associated with reproduction.","Changes in daily and seasonal H. mossambicus availability directly affect Bat-eared Fox activity patterns. Activity is mostly nocturnal in eastern Africa. In southern Africa, nocturnal foraging during summer gradually changes to an almost exclusively diurnal pattern in winter, in accordance with the activity changes of H. mossambicus. Diurnal foraging peaks when insect activity is highest. Bat-eared Fox groups in the Serengeti frequently patrol known Hodotermes patches in their territory after leaving the den in the evening.",,"CITES notlisted. Classified as Least Concern on The IUCNRed List. No current legal protection known. The species is common in conservation areas in southern and eastern Africa, becoming uncommon in arid areas and on farmland. Primary threats are hunting for skins, persecution as erroneously perceived predators of young lambs, and road kills. Population numbers can fluctuate from abundant to rare depending on rainfall, food availability, breeding stage and disease.

In Japan , Raccoon Dog habitat includes deciduous forests, broad-leaved evergreen forests, mixed forests, farmlands, and urban areas from coastal to sub-alpine zones. In the countryside, the species prefers herbaceous habitats and is less likely to use Cryptomeria plantations throughout the year, although riparian areas are often used. In urban environments, Raccoon Dogs inhabit areas with as little as 5% forest cover. In the Russian Far East, they avoid dense forests in favor of open landscapes, especially damp meadows and agricultural land. In the introduced range, Raccoon Dogs favor moist forests and shores ofrivers and lakes, especially in early summer. In late summer and autumn they favor moist heaths with abundant berries. In the Finnish archipelago, however, they prefer barren pine forests, where they feed on crowberries (Empetrum nigrum).","Raccoon Dogs are omnivores and seasonal food habits shift as food availability changes. In most areas small rodents form the bulk of their diet in all seasons. Frogs, lizards, invertebrates, insects (including adults and larvae of Orthoptera, Coleoptera, Hemiptera, Diptera, Lepidoptera, Odonata ), and birds and their eggs are also consumed, especially in early summer. Plants are eaten frequently; berries and fruits serve as an important and favored food source in late summer and autumn, when Raccoon Dogs decrease their food intake before entering winter dormancy. Oats, sweet corn, watermelon, and other agriculture products often are found in Raccoon Dog stomachs. Carrion, fish, and crustaceans are consumed when available. As opportunistic generalists, Raccoon Dogs forage by searching close to the ground and may also climb trees for fruits. They mainly forage in pairs, usually wandering some distance from each other.","Testosterone levels in males peak in February/March, and progesterone levels in females coincide even with absence of males, suggesting that the species is monoestrous, with seasonal and spontaneous ovulation. Raccoon Dogs reach sexual maturity at 9-11 months and can breed in the first year, but a first-year female will enter estrus more than one month later than older females. Females can reproduce every year. Mating usually occurs in March, and the onset of spring and the length of winter lethargy determine the time of ovulation. Mating occurs in the back-to-back copulatory posture typical of other canids. Gestation period is nine weeks, parturition mostly occurring in May (varies from April to June). The parents settle in a den about a week before the pups are born. Raccoon Dogs will den in old European Badger (Meles meles) setts or fox dens, or alternatively dig their own dens in soft sandy soil. They will also use active Badgersetts, usually together with Badgers. Winter dens usually are located within their home range, but if suitable dens are not available, they may be several kilometers outside the summer home range. Mean litter size varies between four and five in Japan (birth weight approximately 100 g ) to nine in Finland and Poland (birth weight about 120 g ), and also in the original distribution area in south-eastern Russia . Litter size in north-western Russia is smaller (6-7) on average because of the harsh winters. Litter size is affected by the abundance of wild berries: when berries are abundant, females are in good condition the following spring, and fetal mortality is low and litter sizes are large. At higher latitudes, the young are born later and remain small and slim in late autumn, and may not reproduce the following spring. Therefore, the productivity of the population is lower in areas with long winters compared to areas with milder climates. Pups start emerging from the den at three to four weeks of age and are weaned at about one week later. Both sexes exhibit parental care, taking turns attending the den during the early nursing period. Because the food items of Raccoon Dogs are small, food is not carried to the den. The pups are fed with milk until they start to forage for themselves. The young usually reach adult body size by the first autumn.","Mainly nocturnal, leaving their dens 1-2 hours after sunset. When they have pups, females also forage during the daytime while the male is babysitting. In spring, Raccoon Dogs are also seen during daytime when sunbathing on south-facing slopes ofhills. In areas where winters are harsh they enter a form of hibernation (winter lethargy) in November and become active again in March. The Raccoon Dog is the only canid known to hibernate.",,"CITES not listed. Classified as Least Concern on The [UCN Red List. In many countries where the Raccoon Dog is hunted legally, hunting is permitted year round (e.g. Sweden , Hungary and Poland ). However, in Finland females with pups are protected in May, June, and July, in Belarus hunting is allowed from October to February, and in Mongolia hunting requires a license and is allowed only from October to February. In Japan , hunting and trapping of the species also requires a license or other form of permission and is restricted to a designated hunting season. Species abundance is unknown in the Far East outside ofJapan, where it is considered common. In its European range the species is common to abundant, although rare in Denmark and Sweden . Threats across its range include road kills, persecution, government attitudes, epidemics (scabies, distemper, and rabies), and pollution.",Bannikov (1964) | Fukue (1991 | 1993) | Helle & Kauhala (1995) | Ikeda (1982 | 1983) | Kauhala (1992 | 1996) | Kauhala & Auniola (2000) | Kauhala & Helle (1995) | Kauhala & Saeki (2004) | Kauhala | Helle & Pietila (1998) | Kauhala | Helle & Taskinen (1993) | Kauhala | Kaunisto & Helle (1993) | Kauhala | Laukkanen & von Rége (1998) | Korhonen (1988) | Korhonen et al.

Tends to avoid open savannah, thickly wooded areas, and arid zones, but does enter the equatorial forest belt in the wake of human settlement. Side-striped Jackals frequently occur near rural dwellings and farm buildings, and penetrate suburban and urban areas. Where Side-striped Jackals occur sympatrically with Golden and Black-backed Jackals, they may avoid competition by ecological segregation. In such areas of sympatry, Side-striped Jackals usually occupy areas of denser vegetation, and Black-backed and Golden Jackals dominate in the more open areas.","Omnivorous, with a diet that is responsive to both seasonal and local variation in food availability. On commercial farmland in the Zimbabwe highveld, they eat mainly wild fruit (30%) and small (less than 1 kg ) to medium-sized (more than 1 kg ) mammals (27% and 23%, respectively). The remainder of their diet comprises birds, invertebrates, cattle cake, grass, and carrion. In wildlife areas of western Zimbabwe , Side-stripedJackals feed largely on invertebrates during the wet season and small mammals up to the size of Spring hares (Pedetes capensis) during the dry months of the year. They scavenge extensively from safari camp rubbish dumps and occasionally from large carnivore kills (although they are often out-competed for this resource by Black-backed Jackals). In the Ngorongoro Crater, Side-striped Jackals have been recorded competing with Black-backed Jackals for Grant's Gazelle (Nanger granti) fawns. Their diet may consist exclusively of certain fruits when in season. Apparently less predatory than other jackals, although according to one authority this may not hold when prey is highly available. The species forages solitarily, although in western Zimbabwe family groups have been observed feeding together on abundant resources, and as many as twelve have been counted at kills or scavenging offal outside towns. Jackals have been described foraging opportunistically, exploiting food-rich habitats by random walks, and they display an amazing ability to find food where none seems obvious to the human observer.","In Zimbabwe , mating occurs mostly during June and July, and the gestation period is about 60 days. Litters of 4-6 pups are born from August to November, coinciding with the onset of the rainy season. Pup mortality is thought to be high. Abandoned Aardvark (Orycteropus afer) holes or excavated termitaria are common den sites, with the den chamber occurring 0-75— 1 m below the surface and 2-3 m from the entrance. The same pair may use such dens in consecutive years. After the pups are weaned, both parents assist in rearing them, returning at two- to three-hour intervals through the night to feed the pups on food that is probably regurgitated. The pups are aggressive towards each other, as evidenced by the degree of wounding observed. Yearold offspring remain in the parental territory while additional offspring are raised. It appears likely that alloparental care as observed in other jackals also occurs in this species, which may be more social than previously thought.","Primarily nocturnal, but can employ extremely flexible foraging strategies in areas where they are persecuted. May also adapt activity pattern to reduce competition when in sympatry with Black-backed Jackals.",,"CITES notlisted. Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. No legal protection outside protected areas. Regional estimates of population abundance are not available, but from work undertaken in two diverse habitats in Zimbabwe , it seems reasonable to assume the species is common and to estimate a total population in excess of three million. The species appears well capable of exploiting urban and suburban habitats, a factor which may help to ensure its persistence. It is likely that the population is at least stable. Side-striped Jackals are persecuted because of their role in rabies transmission and their putative role as stock killers. In areas of high human population density, snaring may be the commonest cause of death in adult jackals. It is unlikely that this persecution has an effect on the overall population, but indiscriminate culling through poisoning could affect local abundance. The species’ dietary flexibility and ability to co-exist with humans on the periphery of settlements and towns suggests that populations are only vulnerable in cases of extreme habitat modification or intense disease epidemics.",Atkinson (1997a | 1997b) | Atkinson & Loveridge (2004) | Atkinson | Macdonald & Kamizola (2002) | Atkinson | Rhodes et al.

They have been recorded at elevations of 3800 m in the Bale Mountains of Ethiopia and are well established around hill stations at 2000 m in India .","An omnivorous and opportunistic forager, the Golden Jackal’s diet varies according to season and habitat. According to one study in east Africa, although they consume invertebrates and fruit, over 60% of Golden Jackal diet consisted of rodents, lizards, snakes, birds (from quail to flamingoes), hares, and Thomson's Gazelle (Eudorcas thomsoni). In India , over 60% of the diet comprised rodents, birds, and fruit in Bharatpur, while in Kanha over 80% ofthe diet consisted of rodents, reptiles, and fruit. In Sariska Tiger Reserve, India , scat analysis (n = 36) revealed that Golden Jackal diet included mainly mammals (45% occurrence, of which 36% was rodents), vegetable matter (20%), birds (19%), and reptiles and invertebrates (8% each). Golden Jackals often ingest large quantities of vegetable matter, and during the fruiting season in India they feed intensively on the fruits of Ziziphus sp., Carissa carvanda, Syzigium cuminii, and pods of Prosopis juliflora and Cassia fistula. Single jackals typically hunt smaller prey like rodents, hares, and birds. They use their hearing to locate rodents in the grass and then leap in the air and pounce on them; they also dig out Indian Gerbils (7atera indica) from their burrows. They have been observed to hunt young, old, and infirm ungulates that are sometimes 4-5 times their body weight. Although Golden Jackals are able to hunt alone, cooperative hunting in small packs of 2—4 individuals is often more successful and permits them to kill larger prey, including antelope fawns and langur monkeys (Presbytis pileata and P. entellus). Groups of 5-18 Golden Jackals have been sighted scavenging on carcasses of large ungulates, and there is a report of similar aggregations on clumped food resources in Israel . In several areas of India and Bangladesh , jackals subsist primarily by scavenging on carrion and garbage. They also cache food.","Reproductive activity occurs from February to March in India and Turkmenistan , and from October to March in Israel . In Tanzania , mating typically occurs from October to December, with pups being born from December to March. Timing of births coincides with abundance of food supply; for example, at the beginning of the monsoon season in northern and central India , and with the calving of Thomson's Gazelle in the Serengeti. Females are typically monoestrous, but there is evidence in Tanzania of multiple litters. Gestation lasts about 63 days. Meanlitter size has been recorded as 5-7 (range 1-8) in Tanzania . In the Bhal area in India average litter size was 3-6 (range 2-5). In Tanzania , two pups on average have been recorded emerging from the den at three weeks of age. Golden Jackals in India excavate their dens in late April to May, mainly in natural and man-made embankments, usually in scrub habitat. Rivulets, gullies, road, and check-dam embankments are prime denning habitats, and drainage pipes and culverts are also used. Dens may have 1-3 openings and typically are about 2-3 m long and 0-5- 1 m deep. In Tanzania both parents and “helpers” (offspring from previous litters) provision and guard the new pups, which results in higher pup survival. The male also feeds his mate during her pregnancy, and both the male and “helpers” (i.e. other social group members) provision the female during the period of lactation.","Golden Jackals are mainly nocturnal, but have flexible activity patterns and may be active during the day. During Blackbuck (Antilope cervicapra) calving peaks in Velavadar National Park, India , for example, jackals were observed searching throughout the day for calves in hiding, searches intensifying during the early morning and late evening.",,"CITES Appendix II ( India ). Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. Jackals are on Schedule III of India’s Wildlife Protection Act (1972) and are afforded the least legal protection (mainly to control trade of pelts and tails). However, no hunting of any wildlife is permitted under the current legal system in India . Fairly common throughout its range, although considered to be steadily declining except in protected areas. High densities are observed in areas with abundant food and cover. Known density estimates for parts of India enable a minimum population estimate of over 80,000 Golden Jackals for the Indian sub-continent. Population estimates for Africa are not available, but densities in the Serengeti National Park have been recorded as high as 4 adults /km?®. Traditional land use practices such as livestock rearing and dry farming are conducive to the survival of jackals and other wildlife, but are being steadily replaced by industrialization and intensive agriculture; similarly, wilderness areas and rural landscapes are being rapidly urbanized. Jackal populations adapt to some extent to these changes and may persist for a while, but will eventually disappear from such areas. There are no other known threats, except for local policies of extirpation and poisoning.",Coetzee (1977) | Fuller et al.

Suitable habitats are above the tree-line, from about 3200 to 4500 m , with some wolves present in montane grasslands at 3000 m . However, subsistence agriculture extends up to 3500-3800 m in many areas, restricting the wolves to higher ranges. Rainfall at high altitude varies between 1000 and 2000 mm /year, with one pronounced dry period from December to February/March. Wolves utilize all Afro-alpine habitats, but prefer open areas with short herbaceous and grassland communities where rodents are most abundant, along flat or gently sloping areas with deep soils and poor drainage in parts. Prime habitats in the Bale Mountains are characterized by short herbs (Alchemilla spp.) and grasses, and low vegetation cover, a community maintained in continuous succession as a result of Ethiopian African Mole Rat (Tachyoryctes macrocephalus) burrowing activity. Other good habitats include tussock grasslands (Festuca spp., Agrostis spp.), high-altitude shrubs dominated by Helichrysum spp., and short grasslands in shallow soils. In northern parts of the range, plant communities characterized by a matrix of “guassa” tussock grasses (Festuca spp.), “cherenfi” bushes (Euryops pinifolius) and giant lobelias (Lobelia rhynchopetalum) sustain high rodent abundance and are preferred by wolves. Ericaceous moorlands (Erica and Phillipia spp.) at 3200-3600 m are of marginal value, whereas open moorlands containing patches of herbs and grasses offer relatively good habitat.","Ethiopian Wolves feed almost exclusively upon diurnal rodents of the high-altitude Afro-alpine grassland community. In the Bale Mountains, diurnal rodents accounted for 96% of all prey occurrences in feces, with 87% belonging to three Bale endemic species: the Ethiopian African Mole Rat ( 300-930 g ), Blick’s Grass Rat ( Arvicanthis blicki ), and the Black-clawed Brush-furred Rat ( Lophuromys melanonyx ). Other prey species include the Ethiopian Vlei Rat ( Otomys typus ), Ethiopian Buff-spotted Brush-furred Rat ( Lophuromys flavopunctatus ), Ethiopian Highland Hare (Lepus starcki), and occasionally goslings and eggs. On occasion, wolves were observed feeding on Rock Hyrax (Procavia capensis), and young of Bush Duiker (Sylvicapra grimmia), Common Reedbuck (Redunca redunca), and Mountain Nyala (Tragelaphus buxtoni). Sedge leaves (Carex monostachya) are occasionally ingested, probably to assist digestion or control parasites. Where the Ethiopian African Mole Ratis absent (i.e. Gaysay montane grassland in Bale and Menz), it is replaced in the wolf diet by the smaller Northeast African Mole Rat (Tachyoryctes splendens). Similarly, in northern Ethiopia Arvicanthis abyssinicus and Lophuromysflavopunctatus replace their respective endemic relatives (A. blickiand L. melanonyx) from Bale. Elsewhere, O. typus , a rare prey item in Bale and Menz, was identified as the commonest prey in droppings collected in the otherfive populations. The same study confirmed that wolves are specialized hunters of diurnal rodents throughout their distribution, but that there is also some degree of variation in diet composition along climatic-induced gradients. Although the Ethiopian Wolfis primarily a solitary rodent hunter, it can also hunt cooperatively. Occasionally, small packs have been seen chasing young antelopes, lambs, and hares and making kills. Ethiopian Wolves will take carrion or feed on carcasses; in fact, a sheep carcass is the most successful bait for attracting wolves. The local name “jedalla farda”—the horse’s Jjackal—refers to wolves’ habit of following mares and cows about to give birth so they can eat the afterbirth. In areas of grazing in Bale, wolves were often seen foraging among herds ofcattle, a tactic that may aid in ambushing rodents out oftheir holes, by using the herd as a mobile hide. Wolves carefully explore rich food patches by walking slowly and pausing frequently to investigate holes or to localize the rodents by means of their excellent hearing. Once the prey is located they move with short, stealthy steps alternating with short periods of immobility, sometimes with belly pressed flat to the ground. The quarry is grabbed with the mouth after a short dash. A stalk can last from seconds to up to an hour, especially if the quarry is an Ethiopian African Mole Rat. Occasionally, wolves run in zig-zag through rat colonies, grabbing the rodents in passing. Digging prey out is common and is the favored technique to catch Ethiopian African Mole Rats. In such cases, hunting effort varies from a few scratches at a rat hole to the total destruction of a set of burrows, leaving mounds of earth often up to one meter high. Sometimes, digging serves to reach a nest of grassrats. Kills are often cached and later retrieved.","The only detailed information available on the reproductive habits of these animals comes from four years of observations of nine wild packs in the Bale Mountains. Pre-copulatory behavior by the dominant female includes an increased rate of scent marking, play-inducing and food-begging behavior towards the dominant male, and agonistic behavior towards subordinate females. The receptive period is synchronized in sympatric females to less than two weeks. Courtship may take place between adult members of a pack or with members of neighboring packs. After a brief courtship, which primarily involves the dominant male permanently accompanying the female, wolves copulate over a period of three to five days. Copulation involves a copulatory tie lasting up to 15 minutes. Other males may stand by a tied pair with no signs of aggression. Females exert mate preference, discouraging mating attempts from all but the pack’s dominant male, either by defensive snarls or moving away. Females are receptive to any visiting male from neighboring packs, and one study found that 70% of matings (n = 30) involved males from outside the pack. The dominant female of each pack gives birth once a year between October and January. Only about 60% of females breed successfully each year. During breeding and pregnancy, the female coat turns pale yellow and becomes woolly, and the tail turns brownish, and loses much ofits hair. Gestation lasts 60-62 days (based on the time from last day of mating to parturition). Pups are born in a den dug by the female in open ground, under a boulder or inside a rocky crevice. Neonates are born with their eyes closed. The natal coat is charcoal gray with a buff patch in chest and inguinal regions. Two to seven pups emerge from the den after three weeks. At this time, the dark natal coat begins to be replaced by the pelage typical of the species. Pups are regularly moved between dens up to 1300 m apart. In eight out of 18 observed natal dens, a subordinate female assisted the mother in suckling the pups. At least 50% of extra nursing females showed signs of pregnancy and may have lost or deserted their own offspring before joining the dominant female’s den. Five and six placental scars were counted in the uteri of two of these females. Development of the young takes place in three stages: early nesting (weeks 1-4), when the young are entirely dependent on milk; mixed nutritional dependency (weeks 5-10), when milk is supplemented by solid foods regurgitated by all pack members until pups are completely weaned; and postweaning dependency (week ten to six months), when the pups subsist almost entirely on solid foods supplied by helpers. Adults have been observed providing food to juveniles up to one year old. Juveniles join adults in patrols as early as six months of age, but do not urinate with a raised leg until eleven months, if male, or 18 months, if female. Yearlings attain 80-90% of adult body mass, and full adult appearance is reached at two years. Both sexes become sexually mature during their second year.","In Bale, wolves are mostly diurnal. Packs congregate for social greetings and border patrols at dawn, around midday and in the evening, and rest together at night, but break up to forage individually in the morning and early afternoon. Peaks of foraging activity suggest a synchronization with the aboveground activity of rodents. There is little nocturnal activity, wolves seldom moving far from their evening resting site. They may become more crepuscular and nocturnal where human interference 1s severe.",,"CITES not listed. Classified as Endangered on The IUCN Red List. Full official protection under Ethiopia’s Wildlife Conservation Regulations of 1974, Schedule VI. Killing a wolf carries a sentence of imprisonment for up to two years. There is an estimated global population of 500 adults , of which more than half live in the Bale Mountains, where wolf density is high for a social carnivore ofits size, ranging from 0- 1 adults /km® (ericaceous heath lands and barren peaks) to 1-1- 2 adults /km? (short Afro-alpine herbaceous communities). Elsewhere overall wolf density is lower; e.g. transect data from the region of Menz estimated wolf density at 0-2 animals per km?*. Recent comprehensive surveys indicate high abundance figures in North Wollo (0-20 sightings per km), intermediate in Arsi and Guna (0-10-0-11 and 0-10-0-14, respectively), and lower in South Wollo and Simien (0-08-0-13 and 0-06— 0-11, respectively). These results were supported by counts of wolf signs (diggings and droppings) and interviews with local residents. Continuous loss of habitat due to highaltitude subsistence agriculture is the major threat. Sixty percent of all land above 3200 m has been converted into farmland, and all wolf populations below 3700 m are particularly vulnerable to further habitat loss, especially in small and relatively flat areas. Habitat loss is exacerbated by overgrazing of highland pastures by domestic livestock, and in some areas habitat is threatened by proposed development of commercial sheep farms and roads. Human persecution triggered in the past by political instability is currently less severe and is associated with conflicts over livestock losses. Recent wolf population decline in Bale is mostly due to disease epizootics, with road kills and shootings as secondary threats. Rabies is a potential threatto all populations. Most of these threats are exacerbated by the wolves’ specialization to life in the Afroalpine ecosystem. In Bale, the Ethiopian Wolf hybridizes with domestic dogs. Although hybrids are currently confined to the Web Valley in West Bale, they may threaten the genetic integrity of the wolf population. Following hybridization, a population may be affected by outbreeding depression or reduction in fitness, although to date this does not seem to have taken place in Bale. To date there is no indication of hybridization taking place outside West Bale.",Ashenafi et al. (2005) | Clutton-Brock et al. (1976) | Gottelli & Sillero-Zubiri (1992) | Gottelli | Marino et al.

Their ability to exploit human resources also allows them to occupy urban areas. Water availability may limit distribution in some desert environments.","Opportunistic, generalist predators that eat a wide variety of food items, ranging from fruit and insects to small mammals to large ungulates and live-stock, typically consuming items in relation to availability. Livestock and wild ungulates are often consumed as carrion, but predation on large ungulates (native and domestic) does occur. Predation on neonates of native ungulates can be high during fawning. Coyotes in suburban areas are adept at exploiting human-made food resources and will readily consume refuse, pet food or other human-related items. Studies of predatory behavior show that Coyote age, habitat, and wind and snow conditions all influence their ability to capture small mammals. Coyotes hunt small mammals alone, even when pack size is large. When preying on native ungulates, cooperation among pack members may facilitate the capture of prey, but is not essential. Environmental factors are important to the success of an attack on adult ungulates, as is the presence of the alpha Coyote pair, and younger animals generally do not participate. The number of Coyotes is not as important as which individuals are involved in the attack. The outcome is also affected by the ability of the quarry to escape into water, its defensive abilities, and its nutritional state. In areas with an ungulate prey base in winter, competition with other sympatric carnivores for a carcass may be intense and there can even be competition among members of the same pack.","Both males and females show annual cyclic changes in reproductive anatomy and physiology. Females are seasonally monoestrous, showing one period of estrus per year between January and March, depending on latitude. Courtship behavior begins 2-3 months before copulation. Copulation ends with a copulatory tie lasting up to 25 minutes. The percentage of females breeding each year varies with local conditions and food supply. Usually, about 60-90% of adult females and up to 70% of female yearlings producelitters. Gestation lasts approximately 63 days. Litter size averages six (range 1-9) and may be affected by population density and food availability during the previous winter. In northern latitudes, litter size changes in response to population cycles in Snowshoe Hares (Lepus americanus). Litter size has been found to increase after cold, snowy winters, when more ungulate carcasses are available to ovulating females. Coyotes may den in brush-covered slopes, steep banks, under rock ledges, thickets, and hollow logs. Dens of other animals may also be used, and may have more than one entrance and interconnecting tunnels. The same den may be used from year to year. Denning and pup rearing are the focal point of Coyote families for several months, until the pups are large and mobile. Pups are born blind and helpless in the den. Birth weight is 240-275 g . Their eyes open at about 14 days and they emerge from the den at about three weeks. The young are cared for by the parents and other associates, usually siblings from a previous year. Pups are weaned at about 5-7 weeks of age and reach adult weight by about nine months.","Coyotes may be active throughout the day, but they tend to be more active during the early morning and around sunset. Activity patterns change seasonally (e.g. during winter, when there is a change in the food base in some areas) or in response to human disturbance and persecution.",,"CITES not listed.

Coyotes are considered a pest species in many regions. Control programs temporarily reduce numbers on a short-term basis, but Coyote populations are generally stable in most areas and free of threats throughout their range.

Given their wide historical distribution, Red Wolves probably utilized a large suite of habitat types at one time. The last naturally occurring population utilized the coastal prairie marshes of south-western Louisiana and south-eastern Texas . However, many agree that this environment probably does not typify preferred Red Wolf habitat. There is evidence that the species was found in highest numbers in the once extensive bottomland river forests and swamps of the South-east . Red wolves reintroduced into North Carolina , and their descendants, have made extensive use of habitat types ranging from agricultural lands to pocosins, which are forest/wetland mosaics with an understory of evergreen shrubs. This suggests that Red Wolves are habitat generalists and can thrive in most settings where prey populations are adequate and persecution by humans is slight. This generalization is supported by one study in which low human density, wetland soil type , and distance from roads were the most important predictors of potential wolf habitat in North Carolina .","Mammals such as Coypu (Myocastor coypus), rabbits (Sylvilagus spp.), and rodents (Sigmodon hispidus, Oryzomys palustris, Ondatra zibethicus) are common in south-eastern Texas and appear to have been the primary prey of Red Wolves historically. Presently in North Carolina , White-tailed Deer (Odocoileus virginianus), Northern Raccoons, and rabbits are the primary prey species for the reintroduced population (86% of the diet). While it is not uncommon for Red Wolves to forage individually, there is also evidence of group hunting by pack members. Also, resource partitioning among members of a pack sometimes occurs. In one study of pack feeding, rodents were consumed more by juveniles than adults, and use of rodents diminished as the young wolves matured.","Red Wolves typically reach sexual maturity by 22 months of age, though breeding at ten months may occur. Mating usually takes place between February and March, gestation lasting 61-63 days. Peak whelping dates occur from mid-April to mid-May, producing litters of 1-10 pups. In a given year, a dominant pair produces one litter per pack. During the denning season, pregnant females may establish several dens. Some dens are shallow surface depressions located in dense vegetation for shelter at locations where the water table is high; other dens are deep burrows, often in windrows between agricultural fields or in canal banks. Dens have also been found in the hollowed out bases of large trees. Pups are often moved from one den to another before leaving the den altogether, and den attendance by male and female yearlings and adult pack members is common.",Mostly nocturnal with crepuscular peaks of activity. Hunting usually occurs at night or at dawn and dusk.,,"CITES notlisted. Classified as Critically Endangered on The IUCN Red List. Extinct in the Wild by 1980, the Red Wolf was reintroduced by the US Fish and Wildlife Service in 1987 into eastern North Carolina . The Red Wolf is now common within the reintroduction area of roughly 6000 km *. However, the species’ abundance outside this area is unknown. Hybridization with Coyotes or Red Wolf/ Coyote hybrids is the primary threat to the species’ persistence in the wild. While hybridization with Coyotes was a factor in the Red Wolf's initial demise in the wild, it was not detected as a problem in North Carolina until approximately 1992. Indeed, the region was determined to be ideal for Red Wolf reintroductions because of a purported absence of Coyotes. However, during the 1990s the Coyote population apparently became well established in the area. In the absence of hybridization, recovery of the Red Wolf and subsequent removal of the species from the USA Endangered Species List is deemed possible. It is noteworthy that similar hybridization has been observed in the population of suspected Red Wolf-type wolves in Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario , Canada . If these wolves are ultimately shown to be Red Wolf-type wolves, this will enhance the conservation status of the species and nearly triple the known number of Red Wolf-type wolves surviving in the wild. Human-induced mortality (vehicles and gunshot) can be significant. However, the threat this represents to the population is unclear.

Age at sexual maturity is 22-46 months, occasionally ten months. Dingoes breed once each year, with litters of 1-10 (mean 5) usually whelped in winter (May to July). Pups usually become independent at 3-6 months.","Mostly nocturnal or crepuscular, but activity periods may extend well into daylight hours in areas where they are free from persecution. Predominantly diurnal in the Arctic summer.",,"CITES Appendix II, except populations from Bhutan , India , Nepal , and Pakistan , which are listed on Appendix I. Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. Current legal protection varies from well enforced and complete protection to concerted efforts to control certain populations. Because of the diversity in climate, topography, vegetation, human settlement, and development of the Wolf's range, Gray Wolf populations in various parts of the original range vary from extinct to relatively pristine. Population densities vary from approximately 0-08 to 0-008 individuals per km*. Population status is fully viable across Canada and Alaska, but Gray Wolves have been extinct in Newfoundland since 1911. Threatened in Greenland ( Denmark ). Endangered in north-west USA , and viable, increasing or reintroduced in other USA range states. Highly endangered in Mexico . Rare and threatened to fully viable in Europe, stable to fully viable in north and Central Asia, highly endangered to viable/ declining in the Middle East, and declining to endangered in southern Asia. Dingoes are listed as Vulnerable on The IUCN Red List, but are considered a pest throughout much of the remaining range. The Gray Wolf's original worldwide range has been reduced by about one-third, primarily in developed areas of Europe, Asia, Mexico , and the USA , by poisoning and deliberate persecution due to predation on livestock. Since about 1970, legal protection, land-use changes, and rural human population shifts to cities have arrested Gray Wolf population declines and fostered natural recolonization in parts of Western Europe and the USA , and reintroduction in the western USA . Continued threats include competition with humansfor livestock, especially in developing countries, exaggerated fears by the public concerning the threat and danger of wolves, and fragmentation of habitat, with resulting areas becoming too small to maintain viable populations in the long term.",Boitani (1995) | Carbyn et al.

Records up to 3000 m . Readily adapts to deforestation, agricultural and horticultural development(e.g. sugarcane, eucalyptus, melon, pineapples), and habitats in regeneration. In the arid Chaco regions of Bolivia , Paraguay , and Argentina , confined to woodland edge. Vegetative habitats generally utilized in proportion to abundance, varying with individual fox’s social status and climatic season. Radio-tagged foxes in seasonally flooded savannas of Marajo, Brazil , preferred wooded savannah and regenerating scrub. In the central Llanos of Venezuela , fox home ranges were generally located in open palm savannah (68% of sightings) and closed habitats (shrub, woodlands, deciduous forest, 32% of sightings). The foxes shifted to higher ground in response to seasonal flooding. In Minas Gerais , Brazil , two radio-tagged foxes were observed most often at the interface of livestock pasture and gallery forest “vereidas” and less frequently in eucalyptus/agricultural plantations (8%).","Omnivorous: diet includes fruit, vertebrates, insects, amphibians, crustaceans, birds, and carrion. An opportunistic predator; diet at any one location varies according to availability, season, and probably social status. In areas of human disturbance, a large proportion of the diet may comprise foods such as cultivated fruits, domestic fowl, and refuse. In the Venezuelan Llanos, the percent volume of food items from the contents of 104 fox stomachs from four different locations included: small mammals (26%), fruit (24%), amphibians (13%), insects (11%); the dry season diet was predominantly small mammals, reptiles, and amphibians, with insect and fruit becoming more frequent in the wet season. In one Venezuelan location, land crabs (Dilocarcinus spp.) were the most frequently occurring dietary item in the rainy season, and in the Ibera Wetlands ( Corrientes , Argentina ), aquatic birds were identified in 87% of 23 fox scats collected in the vicinity of a bird breeding colony. Vertebrates were the most frequently encountered food item (69%) of 74 prey items identified in 22 scats collected at elevations of above 2600 m in the eastern Colombian Andes, but were the least favored food item (15%) in feces collected from the lowland wooded savannahs of Marajo ( Brazil ), where cultivated and wild fruit (57%) and insects (86%) were more frequently encountered. Crab-eating Foxes hunt individually, but most commonly as pairs; 1-3 adultsized offspring may accompany them. Cooperative hunting apparently is rare. They will tolerate close proximity when foraging on concentrated, easily available food items such as turtle eggs, fruit, insects (e.g. termites), and sizeable carrion (e.g. goat carcass). The young start to hunt with the parents at about six weeks of age. Hunting strategies include spring-pouncing to capture vertebrates, ground-level lateral head movements to snatch insects, and directional maneuvers in pursuit of land crabs. The foxes in Marajo deliver a series of shoulder blows, with face up-turned, to some food items (e.g. toads, eggs) prior to comsuming them. In the same region, foxes search for and consume small stones from specific open gravel sites, presumably as a source of minerals. Foxes cache food items but do not regularly urine-mark them. They probably act as seed dispersers of a range of wild and cultivated plant species, as indicated by the presence of germinating seeds in their scats. Examples include Acacia aroma and Celtis tala (montane Chaco , Argentina ), Butia capitata ( Uruguay ), Hovenia dulcis (Iguacu National Park, Brazil ), Ficus spp. (south-eastern Brazil ), Psidium guineense, Humiria balsamifera, and Anacardium occidentale (Amazonian Brazil ).","In the wild, litters are produced once per breeding year. Litters were observed in Brazil in the months ofJune to December. In the Venezuelan Llanos,litters were recorded between December and February and lactating females were seen in June. Elsewhere in Venezuela litters were observed year round (January, May, July, and October), and lactating foxes were recorded in August. On emergence from the natal den at 2-3 months, the mean littersize is 2:6 (range 2-3). It is not known whether the presence of a dominant female inhibits ovulation in subordinate females. In captivity, births have been recorded in January, February, March, June, and October, and foxes may breed twice annually at intervals of 7-8 months. Gestation period is 56 days (range 52-59 days), and neonatal weight is 120-160 g . Cub rearing is the responsibility of both breeding adults. Additional helpers have not been observed directly in the wild. However, the strong social affiliations between adults and dispersed returning offspring during subsequent breeding periods are strongly suggestive ofsibling helpers. In captivity, both sexes bring solid food (they do not regurgitate) to the young who consume solids from day 16-20. Pups first leave the den around day 28, but more regularly from day 45, at which time they develop the adult pelage. Lactation lasts for approximately 90 days. Post-weaning dependency lasts for up to five months, until sexual maturity, which occurs at approximately nine months. Offspring disperse when they are 18-24 months old. Crab-eating Foxes do not regularly excavate burrows, but rest aboveground in dense undergrowth (including when rearing pups), and also occasionally adopt abandoned burrows of other animals such as armadillos ( Dasypodidae spp.).",Primarily nocturnal and crepuscular.,,"CITES Appendix II. Classified as Least Concern on The [UCN Red List. Crab-eating Foxes are considered common in most range countries, and populations are probably stable. The species is currently listed as “potentially vulnerable” in the Argentine Red Data Book, but not listed as threatened in Bolivia , Brazil , and Colombia . There is little documentation for populations in Suriname , French Guiana, and peripheral areas of lowland Amazon forest. No specific protective legislation exists for this species, though hunting wildlife is officially forbidden in most range countries. Crab-eating Foxes are potentially threatened by pathogens from domestic dogs. The Crab-eating Fox is also perceived as a pest of poultry throughout much ofits range (and in Uruguay as a predator of lambs), and consequently is often shot, trapped, and poisoned indiscriminately. In some countries, pest control is limited by specific quotas (without official bounties), although the system is often ignored, abused, or not enforced. Trapping occurred extensively in dry forest regions in Bolivia before the early 1980s, when single pelts were worth US $ 30, but the species currently has little commercial value as a furbearer.

Bush Dogs have been observed in lowland (below 1500 m ) forested habitats, including primary and gallery forest, semi-deciduous forest, and seasonally flooded forest. Observations have also been recorded from cerrado habitat in Brazil and Paraguay and pampas (wet savannah) edge/riparian areas, and as far as 5700 m from forest habitat. Occasionally reported from secondary forest, ranchland, and fragmented cerrado ranchland.","Primarily carnivorous, Bush Dogs mainly hunt large rodents such as Lowland Pacas and agoutis (Dasyprocta spp.). Their diet often includes other small mammals (e.g. rats, Oryzomys spp. and Proechimys spp., rabbits, Sylvilagus brasiliensis, opossums, Didelphis spp. and the Nine-banded Armadillo Dasypus novemcinctus ). Other prey items include teju lizards (Tupinambis sp.), snakes, and possibly ground-nesting birds. Bush Dogs can engage in group hunting to take prey considerably larger than themselves, such as Capybaras (Hydrochoeris hydrochaeris), and rheas (Rhea americana), deer (Mazama spp.), and even South American Tapir (Tapirus terrestris). Bush Dogs hunt in packs of 2-8 animals (mean 4-5) employing a variety of cooperative hunting strategies. Prey is pursued relentlessly by the pack, even into deep water. In Bolivia the dogs hunt Mazama deer by attacking the legs until the animaltires and falls. Olfaction may play a large role when foraging. Some individuals may enter the burrow of a prey species while other pack members wait at possible escape routes.","The Bush Dog mating season is unknown, although pups have been found in the wet season. Captive females have two estrous cycles per year. Estrus is aseasonal and likely influenced by social factors. Dominant females appear to suppress the estrus of daughters. Gestation in captivity is 67 days, and meanlitter size is 3-8 (range 1-6). Lactation lasts approximately eight weeks.

Some evidence indicates that they may prefer areas with low to medium shrub density. Maned Wolves are also seen in cultivated areas and pastures. Daytime resting areas include gallery forests, cerrado, and marshy areas near rivers. There is some evidence that they can utilize cultivated land for hunting and resting, but additional studies are essential to quantify how well the species tolerates intensive agricultural activity.","Omnivorous, consuming principally fruits and small- to mediumsized vertebrates. Numerous studies document a broadly varied diet of c. 50% plant and c. 50% animal material. The fruit Solanum lycocarpum grows throughout much of the range and is a primary food source; other important items include small mammals ( Caviidae , Muridae, Echimydae ) and armadillos ( Dasypodidae ), other fruits ( Annonaceae , Myrtaceae, Palmae , Bromeliaceae , and others), birds ( Tinamidae , Emberizidae , and others), reptiles, and arthropods. Although the frequency of plant and animal items found in fecal samples is approximately equal, the biomass of animal items is usually greater than that of plant items. Certain items, such as rodents and Solanum, are consumed year round, but diet varies with food availability. At least occasionally, Pampas Deer (Ozotoceros bezoarticus) are also consumed. In one study, deer occurred in 2:4% of 1673 fecal samples analyzed. Strategies for hunting animal prey include stalking with a final pounce, digging after burrowing animals, leaping into the air to capture flying birds and insects, and sprinting after fleeing deer. Approximately 21% of all hunting attempts end with the successful capture of prey, and the strategies do not differ in their success rates. Maned Wolves have been recorded feeding on Coypu that were caught in traps set by hunters, and have been observed scavenging opportunistically on road-kill carcasses.","Females enter estrus once per year for approximately five days. Peak breeding season is from April to June. There are numerous published accounts of breeding behavior in captivity, but little information is available from wild populations. In captivity, the frequency of vocalizations (roar-bark) and scent marking increases during the weeks prior to mating, and the amount of time a pair spends in close proximity increases significantly during the estrous period. Courtship is characterized by frequent approaches, mutual anogenital investigation, and playful interactions. Mounting may occur frequently during estrus; successful breeding includes a copulatory tie that may last several minutes. In Emas National Park, Brazil , a breeding pair observed at night for approximately three and a half hours foraged together and vocalized frequently whenever one partner was out of sight. The male marked with urine or feces wherever the female marked. A breeding display lasting ten minutes concluded in a two-minute copulatory tie, after which the pair continued to forage together. Gestation length is approximately 65 days, the majority of births occurring from June to September, during the dry season. One female gave birth to three pups in a bed of tall marsh grass. At 45 days of age the pups had notyet left the den and weighed 2 kg (females) and 2-25 kg (males). All dens found in the wild have been above ground, sheltered by natural features such as shrub canopies, rock crevices, gullies, and dry mounds in marshy, tall-grass areas. In captivity, an analysis of 361 births indicated that parturition peaks in June (winter), and the average litter size is three (range 1-7). Birth weights average 390-456 g (n = 8). In captive animals, nursing bouts begin to decline after the first month, and weaning is complete at c. 15 weeks. Pups begin consuming solids regurgitated by the parents at about four weeks of age; regurgitation has been recorded up to seven months after birth. Females with 7-14-week-old pups have been observed hunting for continuous periods of eight hours over 3 km from their den sites and pups. Pups stay in the mother’s home range for approximately one year, when they begin to disperse. Juveniles attain sexual maturity at around the same time, but usually do not reproduce until the second year. One of the many unknown aspects of Maned Wolf behavioris the role the male plays in rearing pups. Pups have been seen accompanied by two adults , and a female with pups was seen accompanied by a male many times. In captivity, males increase pup survival rates and are frequently observed regurgitating to pups and grooming them. Nonetheless, direct confirmation of male parental care in the wild isstill lacking.",Nocturnal and crepuscular. May forage for up to eight consecutive hours.,,"CITES Appendix II.

Maned Wolves are protected by law in many parts of their range, but enforcement is frequently problematic. Protected in Argentina (classified as “endangered” on the Red List) and included on the list of threatened animals in Brazil . Maned Wolves exist in low densities throughout their range, although in some areas of central Brazil , they appear to be more common. The most significant threat to Maned Wolf populations 1s habitat reduction, especially for agricultural conversion. The cerrado, for example, has been reduced to about 20% ofits original area, and only 1-5% is currently protected.

Potential small populations (less than 100 individuals) may exist in Cameroon , Chad , Senegal , and Somalia .",,"Wild Dogs occupy a range of habitats including short-grass plains, semi-desert, bushy savannahs, and upland forest. Early studies in Tanzania’s Serengeti led to a belief that Wild Dogs were primarily an open-plains species, but they reach their highest densities in thicker bush (e.g. central Tanzania , western Zimbabwe and northern Botswana ). Several relict populations also occupy dense upland forest (e.g. Harenna Forest, Ethiopia ; Ngare Ndare Forest, Kenya ). Wild Dogs have been recorded in desert, although they appear unable to expand into the southern Kalahari or into montane habitats; they occur in some lowland forest areas. It appears that their current distribution is limited primarily by human activities and the availability of prey, rather than the loss of a specific habitat type .","Wild Dogs mostly hunt medium-sized antelope. In most areas their principal prey are Impala, Greater Kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros), Thomson's Gazelle, and Blue Wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus). They will give chase to larger species, such as Common Eland (7Tragelaphus oryx) and African Buffalo (Syncerus caffer), but rarely kill these species. Warthogs (Phacochoerus spp.), dik-diks (Madoqua spp.), Steenbok (Raphicerus campestris), and duikers (Cephalophini) are important prey items in some areas. African Wild Dogs also take small prey opportunistically, such as hares, lizards, and bird eggs, but these make a very small contribution to their diet. African Wild Dogs live and hunt in packs. Hunts appear to be highly coordinated and are often preceded by a “social rally”. During chases, African Wild Dogs may run at speeds of up to 60 km /h, and are specially adapted to cope with the heat stress that this involves. After one dog has made the first grab of an antelope or other prey species, other pack members join and help drag the quarry to the ground. In some hunts, one pack member may restrain the head of the prey by biting its nose and holding on while others make the kill. Individuals may also chase and bring down prey alone. Hunting success is high in comparison with other large carnivore species (e.g. in the Serengeti, 70% of 133 African Wild Dog hunts ended in a kill). Social hunting gives each pack member a higher foraging success rate (measured as kg killed per km chased) relative to hunting alone. African Wild Dogs very rarely scavenge.","Fach pack includes a dominant pair that breeds each year. Subordinate females may breed on some occasions, but their pups rarely survive. Parental care involves all pack members. Such alloparental care is vital: small packs (less than four members) rarely manage to raise any pups. Cooperative care may even extend to caring for adopted pups. Whelping occurs once per year, and gestation lasts 71-73 days. Wild Dogs have large litters, averaging 10-11 pups, butlitters as large as 21 have been recorded. Pup sex ratios are male-biased in some populations. The pups each weigh approximately 300-350 g and are born in an underground den, which they use for the first three months of life. The dens are often those of Aardvarks, sometimes modified by warthogs or Spotted Hyenas. The mother is confined to the den during early lactation, and is reliant on other pack members to provision her during this time. Pack members feed the mother and pups (from four weeks of age) by regurgitating solid pieces of meat. Some also “babysit” the pups and chase predators off while the remainder of the pack is away hunting. Pups are generally fully weaned by eight weeks but continue to use a den for refuge until 12-16 weeks of age. They reach sexual maturity in their second year of life, but social suppression can mean that few animals breed at this age, or indeed at any age.",African Wild Dogs are mainly crepuscular and hunt during the early morning and early evening hours. They may also hunt occasionally at night when moonlight is ample. Activity appears to be limited by ambient temperature and availability of light.,,"CITES not listed. Classified as Endangered on The IUCN Red List. Estimated population size is 3000 to 5500 remaining in the wild. Legally protected across much ofits range. However, this protection is rarely enforced and Wild Dogs are extinct in several countries despite stringent legal measures. African Wild Dogs survive mainly in small isolated populations in reserves and protected areas, which makes them more prone to extinction and less likely to recover from potentially catastrophic events (i.e. outbreaks of epidemic disease). More than half of the mortality of adults is caused directly by human activities, even in some of the largest and best protected areas. African Wild dogs using protected areas often range outside borders and into areas used by people. Here they encounter a myriad of threats including high-speed vehicles, guns, snares, and poisoning, as well as domestic dogs, which can be reservoirs of potentially lethal diseases. Rabies, in particular, probably spread from domestic dogs, caused the extinction of African Wild Dogs in the Serengeti ecosystem on the Kenya / Tanzania border in 1990-91 and is suspected to have caused the deaths of several packs in northern Botswana in 1995 and 1996. Canine distemper may also affect African Wild Dog populations, although exposure may not always be fatal. The status of African Wild Dogs in several areas, including West and Central Africa, remains largely unknown.",Creel & Creel (1995 | 2002) | Creel | Creel | Mills & Monfort (1997) | Creel | Creel | Munson et al.

They are not recorded from desert regions. In India , tropical dry and moist deciduous forest may represent optimal habitats, based on the regions thought to hold the largest Dhole populations. Ungulate biomass, particularly that of cervid species, is highest in these vegetation types when compared to others in the same region. Important factors that may influence habitat selection include the availability of medium to large ungulate prey species, water, the presence of other large carnivore species, human population levels, and suitability of breeding sites (i.e. in terms of proximity to water, presence of suitable boulder structures, and sufficient prey).","Diet includes beetles, rodents, birds, and occasionally grass and other plants like many other canids. However, Dholes hunt mainly vertebrate prey, with a preference for medium to large ungulates. They are also known to scavenge and occasionally have been observed eating carrion (e.g. Asian Elephant (Elephas maximus) and Gaur (Bos frontalis) carcasses). It has been suggested that such scavenging only occurs during periods of prey scarcity, particularly during the dry season. Grass is ingested, but may serve an anti-helminthic function rather than a nutritional one. Dholes are communal hunters, occasionally forming packs of over 30 animals, but are more often found in hunting groups of fewer than ten animals. Depending on prey availability, Dholes may also hunt alone or in pairs, taking smaller prey such as deer fawns or hares. During hunts, some Dholes may lie in ambush while others drive prey towards them. Dholes often drive deer into water, where they swim out to surround and capture them. It is common for certain individuals to take particular roles in the hunt, such as leading the chase or taking the first grab at the prey.","Dholes give birth once a year and have a gestation period of about nine weeks. Mating periods vary in different locations, occurring between November and April (dry season) in India , and January to May (end of the wet season) in East Java. Females are seasonally polyestrous with a cycle of 4-6 weeks. The dominant pair engages in vigorous play and marking, culminating in a copulatory tie. Usually only the dominant female breeds, but exceptions have been noted. Subordinate males sometimes show sexual interest in the alpha female and may contribute to the paternity of the litter. Litter sizes vary dramatically, even within the same pack in different years. The largest litter size recorded is twelve, with only one lactating female in the group. In captivity, newborn pups can weigh 200-350 g , although by the age of ten days their body weight can double, and they have a total body length of about 340 mm . Pups suckle from the mother until they are about three weeks old, when they start to receive regurgitated meat from other pack members. Weaning occurs by about 6-7 weeks, although in captivity this can happen as late as 8-9 weeks. All adults take part in guarding, feeding, grooming, and playing with the pups. By about three months, the pups accompany the adults on hunts; however, the pack may not be fully mobile until about eight months. Dholes reach adult size by about 15 months. In captivity, Dholes of both sexes can reproduce at two years of age. Den types range from earthen burrows to rocky caverns.","Primarily a crepuscular forager, but can hunt at any time of the day or night.",,"CITES Appendix II. Listed as Endangered on The IUCN Red List. Latest estimates state that fewer than 2500 mature individuals remain in the wild. Current wildlife decrees in Cambodia give the Dhole protection from all hunting. A new forestry law is under preparation, and a proposalto list the species for full protection is under discussion. India’s 1972 Wildlife Act affords legal protection, specifying that permission is required to kill any individual unless in self-defense or if an individual is a man-killer. The creation of Project Tiger Reserves in India has provided some protection for Dhole populations. In the former Soviet Union, Dholes received the status of “protected animal” in 1974; however, the poisoning and shooting of Gray Wolves may inadvertently affect any remnant Dhole populations. The Dhole is legally protected in Vietnam . Knowledge of Dhole abundance is limited to estimates of the number of packs within a few protected areas in southern and central India , where Dholes are generally thought to be abundant. Abundance is relatively lower in West Bengal , Assam , and Arunachal Pradesh . In the rest of north-eastern India , Dholes are currently extinct or close to extinction. No remotely comparable information on density is available for any part of South-east Asia, and there are no empirical data on trends in this region. Threats include depletion of prey base, habitat loss and transformation, persecution by cattle grazers, and disease.",Clutton-Brock et al.

In general they show a preference for open habitats, tending to avoid dense vegetation. In KwaZulu-Natal , South Africa , they are recorded from sea level to more than 3000 m in the Drakensberg Mountains, and in localities receiving more than 2000 mm of rainfall. Where more than one jackal species occurs in sympatry the selection of habitat is partitioned. Black-backed Jackals preferentially use either open grassland (when sympatric with Side-striped Jackal) or wooded savannah (when sympatric with Golden and Side-striped Jackals). In western Zimbabwe , habitat partitioning was mediated by aggressive encounters in which Blackbacked Jackals displaced Side-striped Jackals from grassland habitats.","Generalist feeders. Diet varies according to food availability. When the jackals occur in sympatry with other carnivores using the same prey base, food resources are partitioned. Dietary items typically include small- to medium-sized mammals (e.g. murids, spring hares, young ungulates), reptiles, birds and bird eggs, carrion, and human refuse, as well as invertebrates and plants. In coastal areas, Black-backed Jackals will eat beached marine mammals, seals, fish, and mussels. Invertebrates such as termites and insects are also commonly eaten. Pairs and small groups are often seen foraging together. Groups of between eight and ten aggregate at large carcasses of herbivores, and more than 80 have been recorded at seal colonies on the Namib Desert coast. Such aggregations are accompanied by aggressive behavior between territorial individuals. However, in the south-western Kalahari, where antelope carcasses are uncommon, groups of up to 15 pairs can feed in succession without much overt aggression. Matedjackal pairs will often cooperate in the capture of prey, resulting in a higher success rate. In Botswana , they occasionally form “packs” in order to hunt adult Impala (Aepyceros melampus), and there are also records of their taking adult antelope. On the Namib Desert coast they patrol beaches for beached marine refuse and move along sheltered paths between food-rich patches; the tops of coastal hummocks are used as feeding sites. In this environment, they frequently follow Brown Hyenas (Parahyaena brunnea), from a distance in the hope of securing the odd food item. Their large, mobile ears are used to locate invertebrate and small mammalian prey, which are then captured with a leap followed by an accurate pounce, in a similar manner to Red Foxes.","Mating is accompanied by increased vocalization and territoriality in both sexes. Dominant individuals within a territory constantly harass same-sex subordinates to prevent them from mating. In southern Africa mating generally occurs from late May to August, and following a gestation period of about 60 days, births occur from around July to October. It has been suggested that summerbirths are timed to coincide with the reproductive season of important rodent prey, and winter births with an increase in the availability of ungulate carcasses at the end of winter. Littersize is typically between one and six, and pups are born in modified termitaria or other convenient burrows, often with multiple entrances. The same den sites may be used from year to year. Pups first emerge from the den at three weeks, are weaned at 8-9 weeks, and are completely independent of the den at 14 weeks. Alloparental care is well documented and consists of feeding pups by regurgitation and guarding them when the parents are foraging. One “helper” may increase the average numberof pups surviving per mated pair from one to three, and two such “helpers” further increase survival to four pups. Pups reach sexual maturity at about eleven months, and even at this early age they can disperse at distances of more than 100 km .","Mostly nocturnal, but activity periods may extend well into daylight hours in areas where they are free from persecution.",,"CITES not listed. Classified as Least Concern on The [UCN Red List. No legal protection outside protected areas. Regional estimates of abundance are not available. However, Black-backed Jackals are generally widespread, and in Namibia and South Africa they are common in protected areas where suitable habitat occurs. Also occur in many livestock-producing areas, where they are considered vermin; however, despite strenuous control measures in many farming areas of southern Africa, this species is still relatively abundant. Snaring and road accidents may be the commonest cause of jackal mortality in areas of high human density. Black-backed Jackals are persecuted as livestock killers and as carriers of rabies. Population control efforts appear largely ineffective and probably only succeed in producing a temporary reduction in local numbers.",Avery et al.

Lactating females carrying large (c. 25 g ) dependent young were recorded in April-June.,"Salim Ali’s Fruit Bats spend the day roosting in wide-mouthed, shallow caves, with all individuals clustered on surfaces of the cave ceiling and in darkest recesses; caves are located near streams. Emergence occurs in small groups beginning at 18:30 h, with peak emergence at 19:00-19:30 h. At night, they roost in rock shelters, caves, and abandoned buildings where groups of 4-12 individuals gather together to feed on fruits carried from trees, arriving after 18:45 h. Salim Ali’s Fruit Bats return to day roosts at ¢.05:30 h. Social vocalizations include calls of 14-35 kHz.",,"Classified as Endangered on The IUCN Red List. Salim Ali’s Fruit Bat is protected under Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, amended in 2006. Estimated area of occupancy is ¢. 2000 km ?

It consumes fruits of from at least 18 genera in 13 families; only near ripe and ripe fruits are eaten. Leschenault’s Rousette also consumed leaves of Beilschmiedia purpurascens ( Lauraceae ) and nectar of Ceiba ( Malvaceae ) and Musa ( Musaceae ). Captive experiments showed that odor might act as the primary food cue when foraging. Leschenault’s Rousettes usually forage alone. Leschenault’s Rousettes disperse randomly to forage in nearby forests (Northern Western Ghats). Mist net captures were 2-23- 5 m high, with upper canopy preferred.","In Yunnan Province (southern China ), Leschenault’s Rousettes breeds yearround, with peak in March-May. In the Western Ghats,lactating females were found in summer and post-monsoon seasons, suggesting seasonal polyestry and postpartum estrus. During this time, females segregate temporarily not too far from the main cluster. Menstrualcycle is 33 days, with one day of bleeding. One young is born per pregnancy.","Leschenault’s Rousettes emerge from roosts late in the evening in groups of a few individuals. Foraging time pattern is influenced by moon phase. Navigation is accomplished with echolocation using single and double tongue clicks, with simple clicks emitted either in beginning or end ofclick sequences.

Populations of Egyptian Rousettes in arid areas of northern Africa and the Middle East have a patchy distribution in human-altered areas with increased roost and food availability.,"The Egyptian Rousette feeds mostly on soft fruits from at least twelve genera of native species (e.g. Ficus , Moraceae ) in nine families and introduced species including cultivated Rosaceae (e.g. plum, loquat, and apple) and Rutaceae ( Citrus ). After fruits have been collected from trees, individuals often use other trees as feeding roosts. Adults consume 50-150% of their body weight daily. Consumption increases for pregnant and lactating females to meet increased nutritional demands. Egyptian Rousettes forage in groups. They might also feed on flowers, occasionally leaves, and even insects. Feeding on insects has been inferred by analyses offeces,saliva, and stomach contents and with direct observation. Egyptian Rousettes deliberately forage for insects; in an urban setting in South Africa , they foraged for and consumed garden fruit chafers (Pachnoda sinuata, Coleoptera), alternating with consumption of figs that were also available in the same area. Efficient glucose absorption by the intestine happens mostly through passive paracellular absorption. Olfaction plays an important role in finding and selecting food. In its Mediterranean distribution, Egyptian Rousettes are viewed as agricultural pests in commercial orchards.","Reproductive seasonality of the Egyptian Rousette varies geographically. In some regions, it reproduces year-round, and in other regions, reproduction can be biannual (e.g. DR Congo ) or concentrated in one breeding season that lasts one to several months (e.g. South Africa ). In areas where births are seasonal, they tend to occur during rainy seasons. Although females usually give birth to one young, twins seem to occur frequently. Gestation lasts 105-107 days in captivity. Lactation lasts 60-70 days. Testes of subadult males are abdominal and scrotal in adult males. Testes are ovoid or round and during mating are c. 13 mm long; seminal vesicles increase in size during mating. Uterus is duplex and symmetrical, and two uterine horns are externally united. There is evidence to suggest that ovaries function alternately from one pregnancy to the next. Pregnancy rates are 80-96%. Neonatal crown-rump length is ¢. 56 mm , and weights at birth are 18-24 g . Neonates are born with folded ears and closed eyes. They are naked except for thin, downy covering on head and dorsum. At ten days of age, ears become erect and mobile, and eyes open. In ¢.9 months of age, both sexes have attained adult size and weight.","Egyptian Rousettes leave their roosts to feed every night. Activity initiates after sunset and ends before sunrise. A study in South Africa showed that the period of activity in summeris longer than in winter when start of activity is a little delayed and individuals return earlier to roosts. The Egyptian Rousette typically roosts in caves but also uses different types of holes and crevices including artificial ones (tombs, temples, mines, tunnels, etc.). This habit is facilitated by its echolocation abilities. Species of Rousettus are able to use echolocation, accomplished by tongue clicking. Egyptian Rousette calls last 140-250 microseconds and allow individuals to detect and avoid, experimentally, 6-mm wires. Echolocation is used in light and dark conditions.",,"Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. The Egyptian Rousette has a wide distribution and large overall population and is adaptable to human-modified environments. It is hunted for food in some parts of Africa. In its Mediterranean distribution, fruit farmers considerit a pest leading to destruction and fumigation of caves, although these practices have stopped in some countries (e.g. Israel ).",Andersen (1912b) | Barclay et al.

Ficus sp. ( Moraceae ) seeds were found in feces in March-April, and individuals were captured near fruiting fig trees. Feeding observation in captivity showed that Madagascan fruit bats feed on fruits that they consume by ingesting fruit juice and pulp and spitting out the fiber.

Hammer-headed Fruit Bats use riverine forests as corridors into woodland savannas.","The Hammer-headed Fruit Batis frugivorous and can commute up to 10 km between roosts and feeding areas in forests, second growth, or old plantations, where it primarily feeds on fruits in canopies. Females, non-adults, and nondisplaying males forage during the entire night along regular routes; they search for low-quality and continuously available fruits (e.g. Anthocleista , Gentianaceae ). Sexually active males start to forage late at night, feeding mainly on higher-quality fruits of Ficus ( Moraceae ). Otherfruits are eaten from at least eleven plant genera and ten families, along with many cultivated fruits. Fruits are taken in the mouth and carried to a nearby tree, where they are squeezed for juice. Observations of Hammer-headed Fruit Bats attacking and eating chickens, scraps of meat, and skinned carcasses of small birds are questionable. The Hammer-headed Fruit Bat drinks by scooping water directly into his mouth while flying close to water or indirectly by wetting fur while skimming over water and licking water from fur.","Litter size of the Hammer-headed Fruit Bat is one, and each female has two litters/year. Females are in local reproductive synchrony. In Gabon , reproductive chronology is continuous bimodal polyestry, with postpartum estrus. There are two breeding seasons per year, with matings during two periods of 1-3 months. In those periods, 20-135 males group together in trees along rivers in leks that are typically 40 m wide and 400-1600 m long. In these lek sites, males compete aggressively for display territories with radii of c. 5 m . A female selects a male and lands besides him, and they mate. Afterward, the female leaves, and the male resumes his display until 22:00-23:00 h. Up to 70% of males might not copulate during mating season, and only ¢.6% of males are involved in ¢.79% of copulations. Gestation lasts 5-6 months, and births take place in dry seasons: December-February and June-July. Sex ratio at birth is 1:1. Females are sexually mature at c.6 months old (even before reaching full size at ¢.9 months); males become sexually active at c.18 months old.","During the day, males and females generally roost in large trees. Early in the morning, they defecate at their roost site and then rest or sleep until sundown. During the day, they do not make noises, groom, or squabble, and males, which generally rest on the outside of the group, do not approach females. In the evening, individuals wake, start grooming themselves, and leave individually to start foraging or fly to lek sites. Roostsites are 20-30 m aboveground, where Hammer-headed Fruit Bats hang on exposed branches beneath dense foliage. Other roost types exceptionally include undergrowth, rocks, and huts, and there is an unconfirmed record of a cave. Males compete in leks by beating their wings and especially by making loud honking sounds (c.2-3/second). These calls attract females.",,"Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. The Hammer-headed Fruit Bat has a wide distribution and presumably large population. It is unlikely to be declining fast enough to be listed in a higher category.

Wahlberg's Epauletted Fruit Bats feed while briefly hovering in front of fruits or flowers or after landing on a branch nearby. Fruitis often carried to a feeding perch where it is slowly chewed. Large pieces of fruit are held in one foot against the chest. Wahlberg's Epauletted Fruit Bats pollinate Adansonia ( Malvaceae ) and probably Parinari ( Chrysobalanaceae ). Juices from leaves of Balanites ( Zygophyllaceae ) are swallowed, possibly for steroidal sapogenins and proteins. Beetles and other insects found in stomach contents might be eaten for protein, but accidental swallowing cannot be excluded. They do not seem to drink but were observed flying low over water and wetting ventral pelage.","Litter size of Wahlberg's Epauletted Fruit Bat is one, exceptionally two. Reproductive cycle is aseasonal polyestry, although seasonal bimodal polyestry seems to occur at some localities. In inland Kenya , pregnant and lactating females and volant young were present in November—April. In coastal Kenya , lactating females were found in April-October. In South Africa , most females are seasonally monoestrous, but some are polyestrous. In KwaZulu-Natal , births occur year-round, with peaks in July and November—January. Females are not in close reproductive synchrony, and spermatogenesis is continuous. In Swaziland , young were found in a bimodal pattern, with peaks in January—May and August-October, and lactating females were present in December—May; postlactating females were found from February onward. Gestation lasts ¢.160 days. Parturition takes place at the roost in the presence of male and female group members. Females reach sexual maturity in their first year and males in their second year.","Wahlberg's Epauletted Fruit Bats hang from one or both feet and remain motionless for long periods. Following a grooming session of ¢.30 minutes, they generally leave their roosts at dusk one by one, often in different directions. They fly during the entire night, but flight intensity drops to one-half peak level after 20:00 h. At dawn, they return to their roosts where theystart nose-to-nose sniffing and sometimes licking, probably enabling mutual recognition. In KwaZulu-Natal , theyslept/rested longer and more often in winter than summer, and no individuals slept when ambient temperatures were over 35°C. During the first hoursafter nightly activity ends, they slept with both eyes closed, but this changed to one eye open later on, reaching a peak at ¢.10:00 h. Courting males generally use perches near roosts, 2-20 m aboveground, and at least 50 m from competing males, where they make moderately loud gong-like calls with fundamental frequency at 7-9 kHz and several harmonics, with durations of 200- 300 milliseconds, repeated about once a second. Call frequency of males increases in presence of females; males show off their epaulettes, quiver, and beat their half-opened wings once or twice with each call. After 15 minutes to more than one hour, they move to another perch.",,"Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. Wahlberg's Epauletted Fruit Bat has a wide distribution and large population. It is probably not declining fast enough to be assigned to a higher category. It faces no major threats overall, but in KwaZulu-Natal ( South Africa ), coastal populations have declined because of loss of coastal forests from dune mining. Fatalities as a result of encounters with wind turbine blades have been reported.

Population of the Philippine Naked-backed Fruit Bat has declined at least 80% in the past 20 years as inferred from levels of hunting and habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation—all of which are ongoing and placing continued pressure on population decline. The Philippine Naked-backed Fruit Bat was not recorded between 1964 and 2001, despite intensive surveys, and was considered as Extinct until small extant populations were rediscovered on Cebu and Negros. It has been hunted for local food although public awareness programs are now focused on educating local communities about its conservation value. Several municipal governments contribute to conservation efforts protecting roost caves and surrounding forest as sanctuaries. Municipally appointed conservation officers patrol and report violations of hunting, tree felling, and cave disturbance ordinances. In conjunction with non-government organizations, municipalities have started reforestation programs to increase forest habitat. Lowland forests and karst habitat in the known distribution of the Philippine Naked-backed Fruit Bat have been heavily degraded by logging, agriculture, and mining for copper and gold. Less than 4% of Negros Island remains forested, generally with only small patches of degraded forest remaining. On Cebu , largest remaining fragment of forest in the distribution is ¢.60 ha and is threatened by tree cutting for charcoal and agricultural development. Harvest for local consumption has caused past population declines and continues. More than 50% of respondents to an ethnobiological/hunting survey conducted in Sipalay City admitted they hunted and sold Philippine Naked-backed Fruit Bats in street markets. Since 1995, it has rarely been captured in caves where it was previously hunted. These hunters also indicated that only few individuals have been taken since 2003, suggesting a severe population decline. Guano miners historically have disturbed roosts. It has been bred successfully in captivity for the pet industry, and efforts should be made to develop a well-designed captive breeding program.

Females achieve adult size by their second year and apparently start breeding during their third year oflife.","Bulmer’s Fruit Bats roost in large caves and leave roosts at 18:00 19:00 h; when disturbed, they delay emergence from roosts. They emerge and start circling the roost for 5-10 minutes, emitting a birdlike call, before leaving to unknown feeding areas; they return to roosts minutes before 06:00 h.",,"Classified as Critically Endangered on The IUCN Red Lust. Bulmer’s Fruit Bat is one of the rarest bats in the World. It is considered a Pleistocene holdover, and populations have been decreasing ever since. The Papua New Guinea highlands might representits last retreat. Heavy human hunting is the main cause of its decline, and it is now on the brink of extinction. Extant individuals are known from only three localities, all in almost inaccessible limestone areas surrounded by pristine montane forests. It is highly vulnerable to hunting due to its dependence on caves and its gregariousness. Introduction of shotguns probably led to the collapse of the main colony in Luplupwintem Cave that was protected by local tribesmen for generations and still numbered in the thousands in the early 1970s. The colony collapsed when shotgun hunters, equipped to be able to descend to the cave, raided the colonykilling thousands of bats in 1975-1977. Bulmer’s Fruit Bat is recorded from a few, widely separate localities (one is a fossil site), some of which are in Crater Mountain Wildlife Management Area, where there is local community awareness about conservation; however, this area is not effectively protected due to local conflicts. At a wider scale, Bulmer’s Fruit Bat is not distinguished from the Moluccan Naked-backed Fruit Bat by local people, and thus there is considerable difficulty in establishing a conservation program. The single known roost with living Bulmer’s Fruit Bats might have less than 200 individuals. It is possible that new colonies are yet to be discovered in highlands of Papua New Guinea and Western New Guinea , given that extensive suitable habitat remains available with relatively low human population pressure.",Aplin et al.

The Plateau Zokor prefers moist soil and degraded grassland and avoids desert, irrigated land, and boulder fields. Microclimate of its burrows allows for less extreme temperature swings and milder temperatures overall. While aboveground January temperatures may be —4 to —=38°C, burrows maintain a temperature of 0-5°C. Humidity is high (79-87-3%) in these burrows compared to dry external climate (31-7-53-3%). Nevertheless, microclimate in burrows presents challenges. Oxygen levels are low (17-18:4% in burrow compared to 20-4% externally), and carbon dioxide levels are extremely high (0-22-1-5% in burrow compared to 0-03% outside). The Plateau Zokoris a subterranean and a high-elevation species, and it has substantially elevated red blood cell counts and hemoglobin concentration; it is extremely efficient at delivering oxygen to tissue. Oxygen pressure in arterial blood of the Plateau Zokoris 1-5 times higher than laboratory rats, and oxygen pressure in venous blood is 0-26 times that of lab rats.","Plateau Zokors feed on roots and shoots of forbs, grasses, and some shrubs. They prefer taproots and storage organs of plants such as Notopterygium forbesii ( Apiaceae ), Potentilla anserina ( Rosaceae ), Morina chinensis ( Caprifoliaceae ), and dandelions ( Taraxacum , Asteraceae ). Plants are accessed from feeding tunnels belowground. The Plateau Zokor will grab roots and pull the entire plant down into the tunnel system where it is consumed. All zokors have an adaptation in the thumb claw where it is shortened and wears away leaving a central gap. Under laboratory conditions, the Plateau Zokor uses this thumb claw to clean off taproots such as dandelions. The root is then held in both hands, resting in these thumb gaps,as it is consumed.","Male and female Plateau Zokors never share a burrow. Mating occursat the intersection of burrows of neighboring males and females. During the mating period, males will dig multiple long tunnels, presumably in hopes of entering female territories. Males and females mate with multiple partners during a single mating period. Females give birth once a year, usually in April-May.

Classified as least concern on the 2016 China Red List whereit is treated as a distinct species. The Plateau Zokor has a wide distribution and large population. An annual eradication program was implemented in the 1990s, which reduced population size to less than one-third of its formersize. Livestock grazing appears to increase prevalence of Plateau Zokors because it leads to an increase in the types of plants with taproots they prefer. This increase in zokors may in turn further accelerate landscape deterioration, but the system is complex, and researchers debate positive and negative impacts. The Plateau Zokor is considered an ecosystem engineer. A single individual transfers more than 1000 kg of soil to the surface annually. Its burrowing activities mix and aerate soil, increase environmental heterogeneity, enhance infiltration of water into the soil, and thereby curtail erosion. These activities also lessen uptake of greenhouse gases and appear to facilitate spread of invasive plant species. Abandoned burrows are used as shelters by a variety of small mammals (such as the Root Vole, Microtus oeconomus, and Gansu Pika, Ochotona cansus ), birds (such as the ground tit, Pseudopodoces humilis, the black-winged snowfinch, Montifringilla adamsi, and several species of ground-sparrows such as Pyrgilauda blanfordi, P. davidiana, P. ruficollis, and P. taczanowski), amphibians and reptiles.

Many of the subspecies live in flat semi-deserts with extremely hot days and cool nights.,"When grass is abundant, Asiatic Wild Asses are primarily grazers. During the dry season, or in the driest habitats, they will switch to browse, even consuming woody parts of plants. They also eat seedpods and will use their hooves to break apart woody material to reach succulent forbs. In Mongolia, asses often eat snow in the winter as a substitute for drinking water and have been known to dig holes 60 cm deep to reach water in the summer.","Gestation in Asiatic Wild Asses is eleven months and breeding is highly seasonal. Births peak during April and September, depending on subspecies and location. Within any one population births occur within a 2-3 month period. Females reach puberty at three years of age and give birth to only one foal at a time. Foals generally stay with their mothers for two years.","Asiatic Wild Asses are most active at dawn and dusk, when temperatures are cooler. Although they obtain most of their water from food, they are almost always seen within 30 km of water. Lactating females in particular need to drink frequently; at least once per day.",,"CITES Appendix I (subspecies hemionus and khur ) and the rest listed in Appendix II. Classified as Endangered on The IUCN Red List. The Syrian Onager , went extinct in 1927. The largest population of Asiatic Wild Asses in the world is currently in southern Mongolia , and makes up almost 80% of the global population. The “Mongolian Kulan” population was estimated in 2003 at 18,411 + 898 in four areas. There are estimates of 4800-6000 Kulan in the Kalameili Reserve in China , but they may be a population migrating seasonally from Mongolia . The next largest subpopulation is the Indian Khur , estimated in 2004 at 3900, in the Little Rann of Kutch. Thisis the only subpopulation of the Asiatic Wild Ass that has steadily increased in size from 1976 to the present day. In 2005 the Kulan populations consisted of about 1300 animals in Turkmenistan (850-900 in Badkhyz Reserve and 445 in seven reintroduction sites). In 1991 the reintroduced population in Uzbekistan in Dzheiran Ecocentre numbered 34. There is limited information on the status of the “Persian Onager ” in Iran , but recent estimates give a figure of 600 in the two protected areas (471 animals in Touran National Park in 2000, 96 in Bahramgor Reserve in 1996, and four reintroduced animals in Yazd Province in 2000). There were also five reintroduced onagers in Taif ( Saudi Arabia ) in 2000, and a further 100 reintroduced animals in Israel in the same year. The global population of mature Asiatic Wild Asses has fallen in the last 16 years by 52%, the current estimate of mature individuals being 8358. Today in Iran , the Persian Onageris threatened by poaching, overgrazing by livestock, and by competition with livestock at watering points. Shrub removal also degrades the habitat. Khur are threatened by competition with livestock as well as other economic activity such as salt mining and canal building. Kulan have experienced rapid declines in numbers because of increased demand for bushmeat. The threat from pastoralists who complain that Kulan are reducing forage for livestock is increasing.

The last wild horse was seen in the very arid Dzungarian Gobi Desert in Mongolia , and there has been much debate about whether it was in its preferred habitat or justits last refuge. One view holds that of the three wild horse species that once inhabited the grasslands of Europe, Central Asia, and China , Przewalski’s Horse was the one that thrived at the easternmost edge of the range, where it encountered limited water and arid conditions as part of its natural habitat. Another view holds that these horses favored the more mesic grassland steppes of Mongolia , but as a result of more than a thousand years of competitive exclusion by nomadic pastoralists, they were forced into the deserts, where they fared poorly and died out. Domestic Horses do not fare well in dry climes, but ecological studies on feral horses show that some populations can survive in arid environments where food is scare and the best patches are often far from water. However, other studies show that populations survive and reproduce better in more mesic areas where vegetation is more abundant, more evenly distributed, and water is close to feeding areas. Grass and water are more plentiful in the mesic grasslands of Mongolia , but the winters there are harsher than in the Dzungarian Gobi. Today, populations of Przewalski’s Horses have been reintroduced into the mesic grasslands of central Mongolia as well as arid areas on the edge of the Gobi Desert and the Kalamaili Nature Reserve, which lies adjacent to the painted desert of China . Populations continue to survive in both xeric and mesic areas, although the population in China requires more active management than the ones in Mongolia .","Like feral horses, Przewalski’s Horses are grazers. They inhabit steppe vegetation, especially the grasslands and shrublands of Central Asia. In summer they consume high-quality forage near water. In the winter, however, they must subsist on more fibrous food that can be difficult to locate because of snow cover. Fortunately, strong winds often blow the snow away, making succulent vegetation available.","Females come into estrus for the first time at two years of age, but usually do not breed until three. Males reach sexual maturity at three years old, but do not mate until 5-6 years of age, when they are able to dominate enough males so they can maintain long-term associations with mature females. As in domestic horses, females commence cycling in spring and continue cycling throughout the summer. Since gestation is 11-12 months (330-350 days), periods of breeding and birthing coincide.","Przewalski’s Horses are active day and night, but generally sleep for four hours per day, mostly at night. In Mongolia, during the summer they are most active and move to streams and brooks to forage and drink. During the hottest times of the day they move up to ridge tops where cool breezes reduce attacks by biting flies. Przewalski’s Horses of the Khustain Nuruu National Park in Mongolia coexist with Gray Wolves (Canis lupus). Foals are at the highest risk, and when wolves are detected, females, both mothers and non-mothers, form a defensive circle around the foals. As long as three or more females are present, foal chances of survival are high.",,"CITES Appendix I. Classified as Critically Endangered on The IUCN Red List. It was classified as Extinct in the Wild until 2008, but since then a series of reintroductions have created free ranging populations in both mesic and arid environments in Mongolia and China . It likely once roamed the steppes of China and Central Asia; there are written accounts from Tibet from around 900 Ap. Small groups of horses were reported through the 1940s and 1950s in Mongolia , but numbers appeared to decline dramatically after World War II. The last confirmed sighting in the wild was made in 1969 near a spring called Gun Tamga, north of the Takhin-Shara-Nuruu, in the Dzungarian Gobi. Since the late 1970s, matings of captive animals have been managed world-wide, with the goal of maintaining over 95% of the existing genetic diversity for the next 200 years. Preventing the rapid loss of genetic diversity has helped enhance the genetic potential of free ranging populations. In 2008 there were approximately 325 free-ranging reintroduced and native-born Przewalski’s Horses in Mongolia . All Przewalski’s Horses alive today are descended from only 13 or 14 individuals, which were the nucleus of a captive breeding program. In China , the Wild Horse Breeding Centre (WHBC) in Xinjiang has established a large captive population of approximately 123 Przewalski’s Horses.

Recorded up to 1500 m of elevation in Ethiopia .,"The African Wild Ass mostly grazes, eating grasses, especially Eragrostis, Dactyloctenium, and Chrysopogon when available, and tougher Panicum and Lasiurus species, as well as herbs and general browse. The asses use their incisors and hooves to break apart the tougher foods. Although they can sustain water losses of up to 30% of their body weight, they can replenish these losses within two to five minutes. Nevertheless, they need to drink water at least once every three days and most individuals are observed within 30 km of a water source.","Although the age of first estrus has not been documented in African Wild Asses, in feral asses, first estrus occurs at about twelve months of age. Most females, however, give birth at 2-2-5 years of age and give birth to one foal every other year thereafter. Females cycle every 20-21 days until they conceive and gestation ranges from 330 to 365 days. Foals are independent soon after birth, often remaining alone for long periods as mothers seek water to maintain lactation. Foals begin grazing within weeks of birth but typically suckle for six months. Males tolerate other males within their territories even when females are present; dominance ensures that mating access is controlled mostly by territory holders. Breeding occurs during the wet season, with most births between October and February. The life span of wild asses is thought to be around 25-30 years.","The species is most active in the early morning, late afternoon, or at night, when the desert is cooler. During the hottest part of the day it seeks shade in nearby rocky hills whereit rests. Its body temperature can range from 35°C to 41-5°C, depending on ambient temperature. Females maintain higher body temperatures than males by sweating less, thus retaining water longer.",,"CITES I. Classified as Critically Endangered on The IUCN Red List. Formerly, the African Wild Ass was distributed across large stretches of northern Africa, but now only occupies a small part ofits historic range. The Atlas Wild Ass occupied the north-west region of Algeria and adjacent parts of Morocco and Tunisia , becoming extinct around 300 ap. Threats to its survival come from hunting for food and body parts used in traditional healing, competition with livestock for food and water, and possible interbreeding and introgression from the domestic donkey. Fewer than 600 individuals of the Somali Wild Ass are thoughtto survive in the wild. Only Eritrea , where up to 400 individuals may survive,is thought to have a stable population. Fewer than 160 are believed to survive in Ethiopia , and fewer than ten in Somalia . The Nubian Wild Ass was present in the Nubian desert of north-eastern Sudan , from east of the Nile River to the Red Sea , south to the Atbara River and into northern Eritrea .

It rangesas far south as the Himalayas and north to the Kunlun-Arjin Shan Mountains. Tibetan Wild Asses inhabit three major vegetation zones: alpine meadow, alpine steppe, and desert steppe. Alpine meadows are generally found at elevations below 4500 m in areas where precipitation exceeds 400 mm per year. Vegetation in these meadows starts growing earlier than in the other areas and short sedges, such as Kobresia, and forbs cover about 25-30% of the surface. Alpine steppe is the most abundant habitat on the Tibetan Plateau, occurring at elevations between 4000 m and 5000 m . Precipitation is low and vegetation is sparse, covering less than 15% of the ground, with Stipa, Festuca, and Poa being the most common grasses. Desert steppe occurs at elevations greater than 5000 m . Although the vegetation of the desert steppe is similar to that of the alpine steppe, only 5% of the ground is covered in vegetation. Not surprisingly, the Tibetan Wild Ass occupies mostly alpine meadows and steppe. Almost 80% of Tibetan Wild Ass sightings are in the basins in these habitats. Most of the other sightings are on the hills. Open plains seem to be used as refuges from predators.","Tibetan Wild Asses are grazers, mostly concentrating on Stipa, which comprises up to 656% ofits diet in summer and up to 95% in winter. Small amounts of forbs and shrubs are also consumed, and in winter, digging for roots is also common. Waterholes are scarce in the summer and often frozen in the winter, when snow is eaten instead. When the vegetation is of high quality, Tibetan Wild Asses acquire most of their water from vegetation.","The mating season is late and short compared to other seasonally breeding equids, running from late July to the end of August. Gestation length appears to vary from eleven to twelve months. Females typically give birth to one foal every other year. Little is known about the age of sexual maturity in the wild, but it is likely that it is similar to the desert-living “Kulan” ( E. hemionus kulan), which begins breeding between three and four years of age. The age of maturity in males is even less certain. In captivity one male showed no signs of sexual activity by 3-5 years of age. In the wild, males occasionally injure newborn foals while attempting to mate with their mothers.","Tibetan Wild Asses move seasonally among habitats. They disperse in small groups into the hills during the summer in search of high-quality food. As harsh winter conditions set in, they return to basins and flatlands at lower elevations, often forming large concentrations. In the summer, they move daily from lower areas where they spend the night to higher elevations as daytime temperatures rise.",,"CITES Appendix II. Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List.

Females generally stay near their groups when giving birth. When the foal is strong enough to move about, the mother and foal rejoin the group. Foals nurse for about six months, but begin feeding on grass by about one month of age. Females become sexually mature between two and three years of age, but often cycle without conceiving for the first year. Males generally only begin maintaining harems at five years of age.","Plains Zebras are active day and night and organize their daily activities around drinking. Most individuals need to drink once per day, but in very dry conditions, some drink more often. During the dry season the need for water constrains Plains Zebra groups from wandering more than 5-10 km from reliable water. After the rains, they spread out and range widely, seeking superior grazing areas located near transient water sources.",,"Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. In 2002, total numbers were estimated at ¢.660,000. More than 75% of the world’s Plains Zebras are “Grant’s Zebras” (boehmi), some 200,000 of them in the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem. The two countries they inhabit, Kenya and Tanzania , have extensive national park systems earning revenue from tourism, coupled with sophisticated government-supported monitoring systems. Wildlife-friendly ranching practices tend to protect even zebras living on private land in Kenya . Plains Zebras will probably not become threatened in these locales, but aerial survey data from Tanzania suggests a population decline of approximately 20% from the late 1990s to the mid-2000s. Elsewhere, Grant’s Zebras and the other subspecies are faring less well. Civil strife in many countries has led to widespread poaching. Continued habitat conversion to agriculture and loss due to development isolate and threaten the demographic and genetic integrity of small populations. In the past Plains Zebras have shown resilience and an ability to bounce back quickly from population reductions. With the establishment of effective management, protection, and monitoring, most Plains Zebra populations are likely to survive.

It does not need to drink daily and lives in habitats intermediate between the arid habitats of the true desert-dwelling African Wild Ass (FE. africanus ), and the more water dependant Plains Zebra , which inhabits mesic tropical grasslands. Lactating females stay in the most open areas around water; non-lactating females and territorial males prefer grassy areas with light tree cover. Bachelor males grade into areas of medium or moderate bush, but overall, Grevy’s Zebras avoid densely wooded areas except during periods of extreme drought.","Grevy’s Zebras are predominantly grazers, but browse can account for up to 30% oftheir diet during drought or when foraging on landscapes degraded by livestock. They move through habitats quickly, taking many steps per bite, selectively choosing certain grass species over others. As a result, when grazing herds of Grevy’s and Plains Zebras form, the herds don’t persist for long, since Grevy’s Zebras simply pass through them. Availability of water and individual water requirements ultimately determine where Grevy’s Zebras can forage. Since non-lactating females can go without water for up to five days, they typically range far from water, seeking out previously well-watered areas with large quantities of vegetation. Lactating females, with their need to produce milk, must drink daily. Thus they remain near water, feeding on closely cropped grazing lawns that offer forage of high nutritive quality even if the amount of available food is limited.","Grevy’s Zebras can breed year-round, but most births are timed to coincide with the arrival of the long rains that normally fall between April and June. Where Grevy’s Zebras reside, two rainy seasons are expected, since the intertropical convergence zone sweeps across the Equator twice per year. But often one or more of the rains fails. This severely limits the species’ ability to rebound after environmental or anthropogenic shocks. When females are in estrus they typically move through many male territories. Males only mate when on their own territories, and because females rarely stay with one male, Grevy’s Zebra males engage in post-copulatory sperm competition. Therefore, not surprisingly, they have larger testes than the other zebra species. To help ensure that they can mate with as many females as possible, when there are no females on their territories, territorial males wander widely in search of bachelor males and aggressively challenge them. By preemptively reinforcing dominance in low-risk settings, territorial males are able to devote more time to mating than to fighting when bachelors invade territories containing many females.","Grevy’s Zebras are opportunists and move great distances in search of food and water. Females and their young, as well as bachelor males, have large home ranges, often moving with the rains to areas where grass is growing or abundant. Territorial males tend to linger on their territories until well after all other zebras have left and only depart when conditions have deteriorated dramatically. During normal dry seasons, when all Grevy’s Zebras are dependent on water, concentrations of males and females develop. Given that Grevy’s Zebras often move 35 km per day if food and water are widely separated, aggregations tend to split apart and are never very large. Sightings of a few hundred Grevy’s Zebras at a time are rare. Although the availability of food and water determine most movements, predation plays a role. Grevy’s Zebras avoid human settlements during the day because of stresses associated with human activity, but at night settlements are sought as refuges against predators.",,"CITES Appendix I. Classified as Endangered on The IUCN Red List. Grevy’s Zebras exist only in the Horn of Africa. According to recent surveys, an estimated 2000-2300 live in Kenya , around 150 in Ethiopia , and there may be a few in southern Sudan . Historically Grevy’s Zebras ranged more widely, from Somalia to western Ethiopia , Djbouti, and Eritrea , and from southern Ethiopia south tojust north and west of Mount Kenya . Extensive hunting ceased at the start of the 1980s, yet populations of Grevy’s Zebras did not rebound. They are still decreasing and from 1988 to 2007, the global population declined approximately 55%. Increasing competition with the livestock of pastoral herders for water and forage appears to be the culprit. As human populations and their herds grew, water disappeared more quickly than in the past. In addition, the presence of humans and livestock prevented the zebras from accessing drinking sites during the day. Constrained lactation, in addition to greater predation risks associated with night-time drinking, reduced infant and juvenile survival. Since less than 5% of Grevy’s Zebra’s current range is located within protected areas, the best hope for enhancing population growth involves encouraging communities to better manage rangelands, as well as increasing the value of Grevy’s Zebras by training community members to become scouts or ambassadors and hiring them to help monitor Grevy’s Zebra population dynamics and harmful human impacts.",Cordingley et al.

Cape Mountain Zebras are found up to 2000 m in the summer. Hartmann’s Mountain Zebras sometimes are found on salt flats. In the recent past they were commonly found in the bushy karoo upland shrub where summer droughts were compensated for by night-time dew and mist.","Mountain Zebras eat mostly grass, although browse in the form of leaves and bark is occasionally consumed.

Historically, Mountain Zebras ranged from southern South Africa through Namibia to extreme south-western Angola . Habitat conversion to agriculture, competition with domestic livestock, hunting, and persecution are the main threats facing Mountain Zebras. Crossbreeding between the two subspecies is considered a potential threat in South Africa , where both subspecies occur,since this would mix and disrupt the genetic diversity of the species. Crossbreeding with Plains Zebras is also a potential threat just asit is for Grevy’s Zebras. Cape Mountain Zebras suffered devastating declines because of trophy hunting and land conversion to agriculture in South Africa during the 19"" and early 20™ centuries. By the 1930s they were on the brink of extinction—a 1937 census countedjust 45 individuals. Since the establishment of national parks in the locations where the few surviving individuals remained, the population has increased to around 1400. Cape Mountain Zebras now live in 17 provincial nature reserves and national parks, the largest being the Addo Elephant and the Cape Peninsula National Parks. Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra also suffered massive population declines during the 1950s and 1960s, primarily due to persecution from an expanding livestock industry. Hartmann’s Mountain Zebras continue to come into conflict with livestock farmers, particularly during drought years when resources are in short supply. Hartmann’s Mountain Zebra is a protected species in Namibia and any use requires permits. The Namibian Ministry of Environment and Tourism therefore has encouraged the commercial use of Mountain Zebras to provide an incentive for promoting tolerance. Numbers are increasing on communal land and overall numbers are in the range of 30,000. Today, populations are isolated, inhabiting the Mkambati and Goegap Provincial Nature Reserves, Amaqwati Tribal Resource Area, and Richtersveld National Park.

They may also occur in deep waters in some inshore regions, such as in south-eastern Alaska, but only where there are shallow waters nearby. Habitat of the Harbor Porpoise is cool temperate to subpolar waters, generally with low water temperatures.","Harbor Porpoises are opportunistic feeders, although their main prey appears to vary on regional and seasonal scales. In the North Atlantic, they feed primarily on clupeoids and gadoids, while in the North Pacific, they prey largely on engraulids and scorpaenids. They eat a wide variety offish and cephalopods, although the diet in any specific area may be dominated by just a few species. Harbor Porpoises feed heavily on small schooling fish that occur in the water column, such as herring and sprat ( Clupeidae ), capelin (Mallotus), hake (Merluccius), and mackerel ( Scomber , Scombridae ); they also consume market squid ( Loligo ) in some areas. Although many of these prey species occur in the water column, many of the other prey species are benthic or demersal. Benthic invertebrates are sometimes also consumed, but these are generally considered to be secondarily ingested. In the north-eastern Atlantic, there has apparently been a long-term shift from predation on declining stocks of clupeid fish (mainly herring, Clupea harengus ) to sand lance ( Ammodytidae ) and gadoid fish.","Reproductive biology of the Harbor Porpoise has been studied more extensively than for any other member of the family, due to the large number of specimens that have been available from strandings and incidental catches in fisheries. Mating system of the Harbor Porpoise is thought to be promiscuous. Anatomical evidence (Harbor Porpoises have some of the largest testes relative to body mass of any mammal species) has for some time suggested that sperm competition may be the primary way that males compete to inseminate females. Recent behavioral observations of Harbor Porpoises in the San Francisco Bay area (USA) appear to support this idea. Young are typically born in April-August (late spring through mid-summer), after gestation of ¢.10-11 months. Offspring are weaned before they reach one year of age. Sexual maturity occurs at 3—4 years of age and lengths of 120-150 cm. There is geographic variation in these parameters among different populations, and densitydependent variation has also been documented. Harbor Porpoises regularly interbreed and produce hybrids with Dall’s Porpoises ( Phocoenoides dalli ) in the inshore waters of the Pacific Northwest (Washington State, USA and southern British Columbia, Canada) and occasionally elsewhere where the two species are sympatric. It is virtually always the case that the mother is a Dall’s Porpoise and the father is a Harbor Porpoise, and this is what would be predicted, based on their respective mating systems (Dall’s are considered polygynous, with males apparently not using sperm competition, but guarding females to prevent insemination by other males). Harbor Porpoiseslive into their 20s, although in some areas most individuals may die before they reach twelve years of age.","Harbor Porpoises are shy and unobtrusive animals, with a low surfacing profile and not a great deal of aerial behavior. They do not ride bow waves of vessels, and in many cases, they appear to actively avoid motorized vessels. There are exceptions to this, and at least in the San Francisco Bay area, they may be more approachable. These individuals sometimes lie nearly motionless at the surface for several seconds, and it is not clear why they do this. The typical surfacing pattern is a slow roll, in which the individual does not create any splash. At times, they do move faster and surface with a sloppy splash (this is called “pop-splashing,” and the splash looks very different from the more V-shaped splash of a rooster-tailing Dall’s Porpoise). Diving behavior of Harbor Porpoises has been studied with time-depth recording tags. Although most dives last less than one minute, Harbor Porpoises have been found to be capable of diving to depths of at least 220 m and for periods of more than five minutes.",,"CITES Appendix II. Classified as Least Concern on The [IUCN Red List. The subspecies relicta is classified as Endangered, and the Baltic Sea population, which only numbers ¢.500-600 individuals,is classified as Critically Endangered. Other subspecies have not been evaluated separately on The IUCN Red List. There has been a long and somewhat tragic history of human interactions with Harbor Porpoises. Hunting has occurred in many different parts ofits distribution, especially in northern European waters. Major hunts have occurred in the Black Sea, Baltic Sea, and the Bay of Fundy, and in the waters off western Greenland (the latter is still active). Many of these caused depletion of local populations. More recently, bycatch from fisheries, especially in various forms of gillnets or trammel nets, has been responsible for threatening existence of populations throughout the distribution of the Harbor Porpoise. The largest mortality has occurred in fisheries in the Gulf of Maine, western Greenland, North Sea, and Celtic Shelf, but smaller kills have occurred almost everywhere the Harbor Porpoise occurs. It is believed that Harbor Porpoises can normally detect gillnets at distances necessary to avoid entanglement, but accidents may happen due to attention shifts or auditory masking. Use of acoustic alarms (“pingers”) and other mitigation measures have managed to reduce mortality in many areas, but the only way to eliminate bycatch completely is to eliminate gillnets. Catches of Harbor Porpoises in trawls, set nets, herring weirs, pound nets, cod traps, and even anti-submarine nets have also been documented and have taken their toll. Other threats include detrimental effects of environmental contaminants, vessel traffic, anthropogenic noise impacts, prey depletion, and habitat deterioration or destruction. The Harbor Porpoise is not rare and not endangered. Globally, there may be more than 675,000 Harbor Porpoises. Nevertheless, particular populations in many areas have been impacted by human activities and quite a few of these are indeed threatened and in need of protection.",Amano (1996) | Andersen et al.

The current range of the Vaquita is characterized by moderately shallow waters (mostly less than 40 m deep) just south of the mouth of the Colorado River. These waters are murky and sedimentladen. They are biologically very productive, with high chlorophyll levels, and can reach very high temperatures in summer and autumn.","The Vaquita appears to be an opportunistic feeder, eating a variety of small benthic and demersal fish species. Some cephalopods and crustaceans are also eaten. Although only a handful of stomachs have been examined to determine feeding habits, the Vaquita appears to feed mostly on several species of grunts and croakers ( Sciaenidae ). They also occasionally feed on squid (e.g. Lolliguncula ).","Very little is known about reproduction of the Vaquita because there has only been a single study (using small samples) of its life history. Porpoises, in general, reach sexual maturity at 3-6 years of age, and females appear to give birth every other year (unusual for porpoises that usually have annual reproduction). Gestation is ¢.10-11 months. Breeding of the Vaquita appears to be strongly seasonal, with most births occurring in March-April. The oldest known Vaquita was 21 years old, but they may sometimes live a bit beyond this age.","There have been no detailed studies of the behavior of the Vaquita, and all that has been learned comes from opportunistic sightings or those that occurred during other types of studies. Vaquitas are generally considered to be elusive and difficult to approach. They have a low, cryptic surfacing pattern that generally does not produce any splash or visible blow. They tend to stay many hundreds of meters away from large, motorized vessels, but they may occasionally approach smaller, idling vessels. When foraging, they generally surface 3-5 times and then perform a longer dive that may last several minutes. Their surfacing behavior is very unpredictable. They do not ride bow waves of boats and have never been observed breaching or performing other aerial displays.",,"CITES Appendix I. Classified as Critically Endangered on The [UCN Red List. The Vaquita is also listed as endangered on nationallegislation in Mexico and the USA. It is currently considered by many to be the most endangered marine mammal species in the world. The entire population of the Vaquita was estimated at 245 individuals in 2008, and this represents a nearly 8% annual decline in numbers estimated by the same methods in 1997. If this decline has continued, then the Vaquita would number less than 200 individuals in 2013. There are a number of potential threats, but only entanglement in gillnets has been documented as the definite cause of death for most specimens examined. Until recently, the major culprit was the fishery for totoaba ( Totoaba macdonaldi , a sea bass found in the northern Gulf of California), but in the last couple of decades, other gillnetfisheries have become more prominent within the distribution of the Vaquita. Targets of these fisheries include several species of finfish, sharks, rays, and in particular shrimps. The Mexican government has embarked on an ambitious program to save the Vaquita, involving elimination of gillnetfishing within its distribution. New fishing gear (mini trawl nets) has been developed to replace gillnets that cause most mortality, but implementation has been slow. Mortality in gillnets continues, and it 1s uncertain whether it can be reduced to insignificant levels in time to save the Vaquita—the next 5-10 years will be critical.

It has also been incidentally killed in very large numbers in several pelagic driftnet fisheries that have operated in waters ofJapan, Russia, and the USA (Alaska). Other potential threats include occasional kills in trawl nets, environmental contamination, anthropogenic noise disturbance, and habitat deterioration, but fishery kills are major factors affecting populations.

Available data also indicate that Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises in the Yangtze River feed on fish and shrimps.","Life history of the Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoise has been relatively well studied, largely due to the abundance of specimens available from large bycatches in various fisheries. Newborns are ¢.73-79 cm long and are born mostly in spring and summer, although births in some populations can occur in autumn and winter. Sexual maturity of males occurs at 3-6 years of age and lengths of 132-145 cm, and at c.4-6 years and 132-140 cm for females, with some variation among populations. Gestation lasts ¢.10-11 months. Most individuals appear to reach a maximum age of ¢.20-25 years, but they can live as long as 33 years.","Both species of finless porpoises are very cryptic, and they generally have a low surfacing profile. Although they do not appear to leap from the water very frequently, individuals have been observed performing “tail stands” in the Yangtze River.

In particular, populations in the Yangtze River and the Inland Sea ofJapan have suffered dramatic declines in recent decades, and the future of both populationsis in serious doubt. Although the Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoise has an extensive distribution, no global assessment of abundance has been attempted.

In the south-eastern part of its wide distribution, Lord Derby’s Anomalure is known to occur in savanna woodland. Although they can be common in undisturbed forest, they may also nest within dead trees in areas that have been cleared and burned for agriculture, as long as trees are within gliding distance to nearby forest.","Bark of trunk and main branches of several genera of trees appear to be the dietary staple of Lord Derby’s Anomalure. Feeding individuals appear to focus on bark wounds caused by falling branches, elephanttusks, and growth splits. As a consequence of this feeding behavior, some trees such as beli ( Julbernardia pellegriniana, Fabaceae ) may lose all their bark on their trunks and main branches over a number of years. Loss of bark appears to be tolerated by the tree because they are able rapidly to regrow their cambium layer, suggesting that these rodents and trees have coevolved. Lord Derby’s Anomalures eat fruits of Carapa ( Meliaceae ) and Syzygium ( Myrtaceae ), leaves of Cynometra ( Fabaceae ) and Myrianthus ( Moraceae ), and bark of various trees, including those of the genera Neoboutonia ( Euphorbiaceae ) Cynometra , Pentaclethra ( Fabaceae ), Klainedoxa ( Irvingiaceae ), Carapa , Syzygium , and Strombosia ( Olacaceae ) and Strombosia ( Olacaceae ). Elsewhere, they eat fruits, flowers, leaves, nuts, and occasional insects such as ants and termites.","Breeding of Lord Derby’s Anomalures appears to be seasonal in drier areas but not in the main forest block. In some areas, females are known to segregate to give birth and rear young. Pregnant females have been taken in Cameroon in June-July when rains begin, so young are probably born toward the end of rains in September— November. Other observations in Tanzania found well-grown young in May-June during the early dry season. In Equatorial Guinea, lactating females have been collected in February-May, and in Uganda and Kenya, four births were recorded in January, two pregnancies in March, and a lactating female in May. Vaginas of pregnant females are firmly sealed with hard plugs after mating. Generally only one young is born at a time, although there are records of 2-3 young. Offspring remain on a ledge high up in a hollow tree until almost fully grown. Both parents bring offspring well-masticated food, carried in their mouth and cheeks—swollen by a wad as large as a tangerine.","Lord Derby’s Anomalure is nocturnal, with individuals resting in hollow trees during the day, preferably in virgin forest. These hollows can be up to 40 m above the ground (in some woodlands they occupy empty beehives). One radiocollared individual in Gabon had one primary nesting tree hollow and five secondary hollows. They tend to nest alone or in pairs of one female and a young. Other observations suggest that up to eight individuals may share a denning tree, but little is known about their social behavior. Lord Derby’s Anomalures also appear to be sedentary, living in the same hole all year, except when fruit is ripe in another area. Individuals retain use of their dens over very long periods, but seasonal shifts have been recorded. Along with a threatening or defensive hiss and growl, Lord Derby’s Anomalures also purr and twitter. They like to sunbathe in early morning and more rarely in the evening. Pruning in closed-canopy forest is often less frequent or conspicuous than in more open or sunlit areas. Where light breaks through close to a food tree, intense pruning of young trees may help maintain access to a ready food supply by killing or maiming competing trees and keeping flight-paths open. Night is spent moving in lower branches oftall trees and smaller growth, often not more than 9 m above the ground. While resting, a Lord Derby’s Anomalure orientatesitself with head upward and body parallel with the bole of the tree.",,"Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List.

Group sizes of Azara’s Night Monkey are smaller in the more xeric regions of the Chaco compared with humid (mesic) regions. Seasonality in these environments is strong, and temperatures range between —=5°C and 47°C. The Feline Night Monkey has been recorded in Orbignya ( Arecaceae ) palm forest (the Zona dos Cocais in Maranhao ), forest patches and gallery forests in the “cerrado” (bush savanna) of central Brazil , and the “caatinga” (deciduous scrub and forest) in north-eastern Brazil . It also occurs in mangrove forest.","Diet of Azara’s Night Monkey is composed of fruits, nectar, flowers, leaves, fungi, and insects. Feeding ecology of the nominate subspecies has been studied in the subtropical dry forest of Paraguay . Azara’s Night Monkeys there were more folivorous than the Black-headed Night Monkey (A. nigriceps ) in Peru , concentrating on leaves of small trees and vines for 46% of their feeding time and with fruit being only 16% of the diet (as opposed to 60%), and nectar and flowers 33%. At times of fruit shortage, Black-headed Night Monkeys eat more flowers, nectar, fig fruits, and insects, rather than leaves. Flowers can also be seasonally important, for example those of Tabebuia ipe ( Bignoniaceae ). Azara’s Night Monkeys have been seen to catch cicadas during the day.","Breeding of Azara’s Night Monkey is seasonal; births peak in January-February in Paraguay and October-November in Argentina . In Argentina , adult body mass is reached at about four years of age, and the onset of reproduction occurs at about six years. In the nominate subspecies azarae , females have a reproductive cycle of ¢.22 days in the wild and 25 days in captivity. Captive and wild females of the subspecies azarae have a gestation period of ¢.120-130 days. Infants are mostly carried by the male from when they are about ten days old. The median interbirth interval is 370 days (range 345-426 days, n = 13). As has been found for other night monkeys, mating is infrequent. During three years of study and more than 2000 hours of observations, mating was recorded only eight times in five groups. Itis rapid and discreet, and therefore difficult to observe. Although all night monkeys are believed to be monogamous (there is never more than one breeding female and always only one male in the groups), a long-term study of known individuals in a population of the subspecies azarae in northern Argentina showed considerable turnover of resident adults.","In Paraguay , the nominate subspecies is partially diurnal, foraging during the day for periods of one to three hours. Large raptors such as the harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja) and the Guiana crested eagle (Morphnus guianensis) are rare there, and the principal, potential, avian predator is the great horned owl (Bubo virgintanus). When traveling at night, they are quieter than is typical for night monkeys of the Amazonian forest possibly because of this. Temperature may be another factor promoting diurnal activity. Low temperatures do not completely inhibit their traveling and foraging, but when night-time temperatures are 5°-10°C, they forage in the late afternoon at temperatures of 25°-30°C. Diurnal foraging and traveling increases when the weather is cooler. A field study of the subspecies Bolivian Night Monkey in Beni , Bolivia , recorded an activity budget of 31% foraging, 49% resting, and 20% traveling. Groups travel longer during full-moon nights than new-moon nights, and ambient temperature also influences distances moved during full-moon nights.",,"CITES Appendix II. Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. Subspecies azarae and boliviensis are classified as Least Concern and subspecies infulatus is classified as Near Threatened because of logging and the widespread conversion of forest for commercial agriculture, especially for soy beans, and for cattle pasture throughout its range in northern Mato Grosso and southern Para over the last two decades. The range of Azara’s Night Monkey coincides with the most devastated areas of the Brazilian Amazon. The subspecies azarae occurs in the national parks of Rio Pilcomayo in Argentina and Kaa-lya del Gran Chaco in Bolivia , and in the Defensores del Chaco, and Tinfunqué national parks in Paraguay .

In Cocha Cashu Biological Station in Manu National Park and Biosphere Reserve, Peru , they tend to feed more in large trees with larger crowns (more than 11 m in diameter) than sympatric diurnal titi monkeys (similar in size and also living in small monogamous groups) that customarily follow a regular foraging circuit to find small quantities of fruits in smaller crowned trees. Associated with their use of larger-crowned trees, Blackheaded Night Monkeys travel and forage higher up in the forest canopy than the titi monkeys, which spend more than 50% their time in the lower canopy and understory, perhaps due to the titi monkeys susceptibility to predation by diurnal raptors. Diets of Black-headed Night Monkeys and titi monkeys include many bitter or spicy (e.g. Lauraceae ) and unripe fruits not generally eaten by other monkeys. Black-headed Night Monkeys forage for insects, especially at dawn and dusk, searching along branches and among foliage. They are adept at catching insects in mid-air and eat moths, beetles, and particularly orthopterans (katydids and grasshoppers of 6-10 cm in length, which call and are active at night and more easily located). Black-headed Night Monkeys are more insectivorous than titi monkeys that supplement the fruit part of their diet more with leaves. When fruits are scarce at the end of the wet season and in the early dry season, Black-headed Night Monkeys eat mostly figs, nectar, and insects. Their consumption of figs is facilitated by the lack of competition from the diurnal primates .","In Peru , a seasonal peak in births of Black-headed Night Monkeys occurs between August and February during the rainy season, when fruit is abundant.","Black-headed Night Monkeys spend ¢.50% of the night active, with maximallevels of activity when the full moon is near the meridian.

The Brown-throated Three-toed Sloth can reach high densities in agricultural landscapes if overhead canopy trees are maintained. It is a generalist and uses manydifferent tree species, although individuals will specialize on a few species of trees and even spend a disproportionate amount of time resting and foraging within a few individual trees, or “modal” trees, in their home ranges. In an agricultural landscape in Costa Rica, Brown-throated Three-toed Sloths were strongly dependent on intact tropical forest and two species oftrees in the nettle family (Cecropra obtusifolia and Coussapoa villosa, Urticaceae ). In general, trees that have crowns exposed to sunlight and those that contain masses oflianas are selected.","The Brown-throated Three-toed Sloth is a strict folivore, consuming leaves in canopies oftrees. Individuals typically consume leaves in trees where they spend a considerable amount oftime. Diets vary spatially and overall include leaves from more than 50 plant species. They prefer and mostly consume young leaves, presumably because of their nutritional value. The Brown-throated Three-toed Sloth has one of the slowest rates ofdigestion. Nevertheless, estimated leaf removal rate is 5-1 g ofleaves/kg/day. Sloths, in general, are foregut-fermenting mammals, and the Brownthroated Three-toed Sloth possess a unique gut community dominated bythe bacterial phyla Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. Three-toed sloths possess a highly conserved, low-diversity foregut community, with highly abundant species of Neisseria bacteria.","The Brown-throated Three-toed Sloth is polygynous, with males excluding male competitors from their core home ranges. In one study in Costa Rica, only 25% of resident adult males sired offspring, and one individual male sired 50% of all juveniles. Sedentary lifestyle of the Brown-throated Three-toed Sloth appears to facilitate polygyny because multiple females can persist within small patches of habitat and be monopolized by a single male. Females appear to use important mating strategies by switching mates among breeding seasons and shifting their home ranges during estrus. The Brown-throated Three-toed Sloth breeds seasonally. Gestation is ¢.6 months in length, and females give birth to one young over a six-month period that peaks in late February. Neonates are dependent on their mothers, clinging to their venters for 100 days or more. This relatively short time to offspring independence allows females to breed in most years; on average, nearly 75%ofadult females produce young in the wild, and this frequency appears to vary little from year-to-year. Juvenile survival can be high but is lowest immediately following maternal independence.","Brown-throated Three-toed Sloths are active diurnally and nocturnally, but they are more often active during daylight hours and generally avoid activity during the crepuscular periods of the day. Adults usually sleep for 15-18 hours/day, either holding on to a tree with their claws or resting in the crotch of a tree with their heads tucked into their chests. Three-toed sloths have a high degree of heterothermy in their body temperature, and therefore, they behaviorally adjust to ambient temperatures throughout the day. Individuals can be observed in the mornings ascending to the top of the canopy, presumably to warm in full sunlight, and descending into shade as daytime temperatures increase. During rainstorms, Brown-throated Threetoed Sloths do not seek shelter but typically rest in place.",,"CITES Appendix II. Classified as Least Concern on The [UCN Red List. The Brown-throated Three-toed Sloth has the widest distribution of the four species of Bradypus and occurs across various forest types. It occurs in protected areas and is rarely targeted for consumption or other human uses, although occasionally it is hunted in Central America and South America by indigenous groups and for the pet trade. Clearing of tropical forests for crops grown in monoculturesis particularly detrimental because these plantations retain little forest structure. Brown-throated Threetoed Sloths are more vulnerable to habitat loss and fragmentation than other sloths, especially two-toed sloths ( Choloepus spp. ). Nevertheless, previous work has shown that shade-grown agriculture, like that found in certain types of cacao plantations embedded within an agroecosystem, can support viable populations of the Brown-throated Three-toed Sloth, if immigration from surrounding forests is maintained. In particular, intact riparian forests provide critical movement corridors for maintaining connectivity of populations in modified tropical landscapes.",Dill-McFarland et al.

It has been suggested that 7. kanchil occurs primarily in hilly areas, but other sources stated that the species was absent from areas above 250 m in Sarawak , whereas 7. napu occurred much higher. This species also occurs in cultivated areas up to 600 m in elevation. The habitat of this species could be described as a mosaic ofriverine, seasonal swamp and dry undulating country, vegetated predominantly by legumes and dipterocarps, with stands of dense bamboo or palms for daytime resting. In Sabah , they also inhabit mangrove forest, and they can be quite common in monocultural tree plantations in a matrix of secondary forest stands. Even though the evidence is somewhat ambiguous,it appears that this species prefers disturbed forests to primary ones. A review of encounter rates in various parts of the species’ range suggested that the distribution of 7. kanchil is perhaps highly patchy and correlated to specific habitat features and microhabitats. What these features are remains unresolved, but their water requirements are important, as authors note commonness in riverine areas with surprising regularity. The habitat use of this species with respect to edge—interior areas shows startling heterogeneity, at least in non-Sundaic areas, but this cannot yet be explained; in particular, disentangling the contributions of intrinsic habitat suitability and the effects of hunting is difficult.","The speciesis largely frugivorous, but also feeds on shoots, young leaves, and fallen fruits. Fruit mass of consumed fruits varied from 1 g to 5 g and seed mass from 0-01 g to 0-5 g.

They chase and fight one another for prolonged periods, slashing with the elongated canine teeth. These teeth are razor sharp and local hunters in Borneo report that sometimes males fight to the death. Mating occurs throughout the year in some areas. In Vietnam the species mates in November-December and gives birth in April-May. The species is polygynous. Females are almost continuously pregnant.

The presumed short generation length of the species (under five years) also influences assessment. Thus although there may be or may have been drastic local reductions, these have probably not been synchronous over a large enough area. The IUCN review points out several major uncertainties in the conservation status assessment. Firstly, there are few modern records of Tragulus from both the Sundaic and non-Sundaic portions of the range that have been identified conclusively as to species. Secondly, the conflicting nature of the information available concerning the effects of hunting (harvest levels are locally very high) and habitat destruction makes it difficult to estimate population declines. Thirdly, there are strong indications that in its non-Sundaic range (i.e. Asian mainland) it is localized in occurrence, a pattern for which the reasons remain opaque, but which might be the result of hunting. And fourthly, the apparent restriction to lowland forest, at least in Borneo, suggests that with the rapidly dwindling lowland forests in this part ofits range, the species is losing habitat and its range might decrease and become fragmented.

Indian Chevrotains are among the most frequently hunted animals in the forests where they occur. The chevrotains are actively hunted using hunting dogs to locate and flush out the animals and kill them. Even women and childrenjoin with men in hunting during the day. The team of hunters beats bushes and flushes animals toward nets held by people; there the animals are caught and killed. In addition, low wire snares with many nooses may be placed along the ground across trails to catch passing chevrotains. Traps are used for night hunting. Much of the hunting is for direct consumption, although wild meatis also sold in local markets in many places.

The species is, however, not a swamp specialist, and is often found in mature upland forest areas. Its range is thought to be limited by climatic factors: the species prefers habitats with very low seasonality and rainfall equal to or greater than 1500 mm /year, and it does not occur in areas that are even moderately seasonally arid. The species forages in clearings, floodplains, and along river banks at night, and retires to a hiding spot in dense cover during the day.","The Water Chevrotain is primarily a frugivore, and it has been suggested that year-round availability of fruits could be a key limiting habitat factor. Stomach content analysis of 19 animals in Gabon revealed that fruits comprise 68-7% of all foods eaten, which appears to be less than its Asian cousins. The rest of the diet includes leaves (9-9%), petioles and stems (20-5%), animal matter (0-14%), flowers (0-7%), and fungi (0-13%). Compared to duikers—small frugivores that share its habitat—the Water Chevrotain eats relatively little fruit and fungi, but many more succulent stems, and year-round fruit availability might not be as crucial a determinant for the species’ presence as suggested by a few ecological studies. At least 76 species of fruits have been identified in the species’ diet, with preferred species including Cylindropsis parvifolia ( Apocynaceae ), Bombax buonopozense ( Bombacaceae ), Alchornea cordifolia ( Euphorbiaceae ), Coelocaryon preussi and Pycnanthus angolensis ( Myristicaceae ), and Cissus dinklager ( Vitaceae ). In addition to these fruits, figs (Ficus spp.), Pseudospondias fruits, palm nuts (Elaeis), and breadfruit (Treculia) are consumed, as well as the fruits of gingers and arrowroots. Most fruits consumed are small to medium-sized, with a diameter between 0-5 cm and 2 cm . Water Chevrotains also feed on insects; they actively hunt for ants by licking the ground along ant trails. Apparently crabs, carrion, and scavenged fish also feature in the species’ diet. The Water Chevrotain consumes significantly less animal matter and fungus during the dry season,as well as 44% fewer fruit species. Young individuals that are still nursing eat smaller amounts offruit than adults (only 48:4% of the diet) and a larger proportion ofleaves (31:3%).","Due to the secretive nature of this species, little is known aboutits life cycle, and reports about breeding behavior often vary considerably. Olfactory communication is important in this species, and feces and urine are deposited anywhere. Both sexes announce their presence with these excrements, which are mixed with an excretion from the anal (male and female) and preputial (male) glands. The interramal gland is occasionally used for marking twigs. The Water Chevrotain also communicates through vocalizations, including an alarm bark. When fighting, females produce a high pulsing chatter. As with pigs, male Water Chevrotains typically vocalize through a closed mouth, when following a female in estrus. While being followed, a receptive female will stop at each cry, allowing the male to lick her rump. After several repetitions of this, the male mounts. An estrous female will mate with a male with whom she shares a home range. She gives birth to one, or occasionally two precocial fawns. Reported gestation lengths range from four to nine months, and it is unclear whether there are errors in these estimates or that indeed this wide range occurs under natural conditions. In Gabon , births occur throughout the year, although there is a peak in births in January and July-August, at the beginning of the twice-annual dry seasons. Infants are usually found separate from their mothers, “lying up” for the first three months of life. During this initial hiding period, the mother will visit her offspring periodically to suckle, at which time small infants are also washed using the tongue. Lactation lasts 3-6 months. The young disperse from the mother’s home range when they reach sexual maturity at 9-26 months of age. Maximum longevity is normally eight years of age, but the species has a potential lifespan of 11-13 years.","The species is thought to be exclusively nocturnal in the wild, being active almost always between dusk and dawn. In a captive population in Monrovia Zoo, Liberia , activity patterns showed that the species was active 4% of the day and 67% of the night.",,"Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List, with the main threats being habitat loss, through agriculture and expanding human development, and hunting for bushmeat. Due to its secretive nature, there is little information on its status in individual countries within its extensive range, although there is some evidence that it is declining in specific areas. In the Niger Delta, the species was described originally as widespread in almost all freshwater habitats, but is now rare in all but the most remote areas, and rapidly becoming extinct in upland areas. The species is hunted for human consumption throughout its range. In Liberia , for example, the Water Chevrotain ranked second in a taste preference survey in eight urban communities. In south-west Cameroon , one animal fetches about US $ 6 in local markets, giving some idea of the commercial value of such species in places where most people earn less than US $ 1/day. In the central Ituri Forest, DR Congo , Water Chevrotains are regularly caught by net hunters, and consistently represent about 5% of the total catch, even in areas that have been hunted for years. Hunting appears to vary seasonally with the majority of animals entering markets in Equatorial Guinea at the start of the wet season.",Ansell (1974) | Barnett & Prangley (1997) | Barnett et al.

In the late 1990s, a small stock of eight Balabac Chevrotains escaped from their enclosures on Calauit Island, a small island off the coast of Busuanga Island, north of Palawan , where the species had been maintained and bred since 1982. These animals were reported to have increased to at least 21 free-living individuals by 2006. Apparently the species was also introduced to the larger island of Palawan .

It has been suggested that the foot morphology of 7. napu indicates a preference for more swampy habitats than 7. javanicus / 1. kanchil . Another source, from Borneo, however, claims that 7. napu is a hill species, found at no great elevation but never on swamps, plains and less often on river banks than 7. kanchil . T. napu seems to be scarcer in logged forest than in primary forest, with an 86% decline in density being reported following timber harvest. Daily home range use also appears to be more extensive in secondary forest. The sensitivity to logging is probably a consequence of diet constraints that limit the species’ ability to compensate for the reduced abundance of selected fruits in disturbed forest by utilizing browsing. In twelve-year-old logged forest, fewer trees remained belonging to genera eaten by 7. napu . On Tioman Island, of the coast of the Malay Peninsula, densities increased away from human settlements probably in direct relationship to hunting pressure; also 83% of observations on this island were in primary forests and 17% in secondary forests or rubber estates.","This species is mostly frugivorous, although few details on feeding are known. In captivity they eat most fruits and readily take to bananas, though their favorite food was mentioned to be the fruits and particularly the flowers of “Buah Simpoh” (presumably a Dillenia species). It has been asserted that 7. napu are prone to kill chickens, but no direct evidence for this was found.","The species is possibly polygynous; there is no distinct mating season and females give birth throughout the year in Peninsular Malaysia ; one or rarely two young are born. The gestation period is 152-155 days. Weaning occurs at 2-3 months. The young reach sexual maturity at 4-5 months, and maximum life span in captivity is reported to be up to 14 years. 1. napu was observed to stamp with one or both hindfeet when slightly alarmed. Other individuals would or would not stamp in response. Both males and females mark objects with the intermandibular gland. Males mark much more frequently than females. Males often lick the urine of females; less frequently, females lick the urine of males. Males court both receptive and unreceptive females. Courting males mark the female on the back or rump with the intermandibular gland and emit a series of squeaks. Females have a postpartum estrus and return to estrus at approximately 14day intervals unless they become pregnant. Females of 7. napu have the potential to be pregnant throughout adult life, often with only 85-155 minutes passing between giving birth and becoming pregnant again. The young are born fully developed, and they are able to stand after 30 minutes. Mothers spend little time with infants. They emit a vocalization that sounds like the squeak of courting males. Both mothers and infants emit a higher-pitched vocalization. Intense agonistic behavior was seen only when strange individuals were introduced into established groups. Males fight by facing each other and biting each other on the ears, neck, and shoulders with their large upper canines. Fighting males usually hold the tail in a vertical position, exposing the white ventral surface, and may emit loud growls. If one male flees, the other pursues and attempts to bite him on the neck and body.","7. napu is reported to be cathemeral (active day and night), but there are few data to support this.",,"Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List, because it remains widespread and at least locally common in the Sundaic region and, at least on Borneo, it appears that this species is resilient to hunting, although probably not to habitat degradation. Better data would allow a more confident assessment. Its wide altitudinal tolerance (presumed to be up to 1000 m above sea level) means that it has large populations above the elevation where very rapid forest loss is occurring. The presumed short generation length of the species, which is likely underfive years, also influences assessment, because it means that the species could quickly recover from local declines. Thus, although there may be or may have been drastic local reductions, these have probably not been synchronous over a large enough area to threaten its survival.",Azlan & Engkamat (2006) | Chasen (1940) | Chua et al.

Several biogeographic reviews failed to list the genus for Bali , an island directly east of Java with strong biogeographic affinities to the latter. A sighting was, however, reported from Bali Barat National Park, in a birdwatching trip report. Given the live-animal trade of this species on Java , further records are needed to confirm whether or not there is a native population of the genus on Bali . If there is, biogeographic considerations suggest it would be most closely related to the Javan population and quite probably conspecific.",,"Preferred habitat of the Javan Chevrotain includes evergreen and semi-evergreen rainforest. The species has been reported in the drier semi-deciduous forests of eastern Java , butit seems to be rarer there than in the wetter forests of central and west Java . One habitat-use study suggested that 7. javanicus uses dense bushes and stands of Salacca zalacca palms during the day. It generally remains not far from rivers. This suggests that chevrotains there might be an “edge” species, apparently preferring areas with thick understory vegetation, such as that along riverbanks. This would not be unusual within the genus (see other Tragulus accounts). The species occurs from sea level to about 1600 m above sea level in the mountains.","In captivity Javan Chevrotains refuse grass as fodder and do not feed on any grasses that grow in their cages. Instead they are kept on banana peels, jackfruit, and the left-overs of rambutan and mangosteen fruits. In captivity, they are partial to leaves of a number of Acalypha ( Euphorbiaceae ) species, including A. marginata and A. wilkesiana, as well as leaves of Laeucaena glauca, Ipomoea batatas, I. reptans, and Manihot utilissima . In the wild, the species reportedly feeds on fallen fruit, including wild figs (Ficus spp.), and the leaves and buds of a variety of plants.","Males ofthis species are reported to produce unusual screams during the mating season. In captivity they have been observed to fight to the death. With bared teeth (lips withdrawn) males circled each other, and by approaching from the side, tried to get underneath the opponentto stab or slice with their canines. As a result, the belly of one victim was ripped open, causing its entrails to spill. The female had calmly observed the fight, lying down with the front legs folded underneath her body; mating with the winning male took place soon after. Females in captivity developed bold patches, sometimes chafed and bloody, after mating, apparently caused by the sharp hooves of the male during copulation. Gestation lasts several months, after which one young is born, “the size of a rat”, dark brown, with a very small head and thin legs. Young can run and jump soon after birth, and suckle only occasionally, only at night and very briefly. The young soon start eating the same leaves and fruits as older animals. Neither male nor female parent made any apparent effort to protect their young. A specimen of 7. javanicus successfully bred with a chevrotain from Bangka Island (presumably 7 kanchil luteicollis) and produced a young with intermediate characteristics.","Observations in captivity suggest that the species is nocturnal, and during the day rests in a quiet, cool, shaded spot. It becomes active around 16:00 h or 17:00 h in the afternoon.",,"The account of 7. javanicus on The IUCN Red List states that the speciesis classified as Data Deficient, partly reflecting the lack of clarity over how many species of chevrotain occur onJava and therefore how much of the available information about the genus refers to 1. javanicus . The authors mention that there are fair indications of a decline, perhaps a major one, and a category such as Vulnerable is quite likely to be applicable. The species is hunted for meat and is also often sold as a pet, for example in markets in West Java . In the 1920s it was reported that the species was commonly trapped using snares, but no recent information on this is available.

Primary forest habitats include native bamboo such as Chusquea bambusoides, Guadua sp. , and Merostachys sp. ( Poaceae ); those in disturbed habitats are primarily introduced Phyllostachys sp. and Bambusa sp. ( Poaceae ). Most important food items of Atlantic Bamboo Rats include large terminal or small lateral shoots, dry bamboo stems or sheets and leaves, or small green branches. They can consume 100 g (fresh weight) of bamboo tissues per night—a food rich in water and cyanide toxins and low nutritive content. While feeding, individuals remove outer, hard, and spiny sheet from culms using their incisors while holding branches with specialized hands and feet, and subsequently consuming inner tissues of shoots by directed chewing. They also forage on dry, spineless sheets found at bases of lateral branches, holding them with their forefeet while chewing. Leaves are cut at petioles from bases of lateral branches with incisors, while holding the branch with one hand, and then held by the other forefoot during consumption. A large shoot can weight 1600 g (including sheet) and at least one-fourth of the inner part can be eaten in a single night. The Atlantic Bamboo Rat has a simple, acidic stomach to detoxify bamboo cyanides. These bamboo rats can be located at night from piles of partially consumed bamboo materials that have fallen on the ground and by grinding sounds made while an individual masticates hard materials.","Young Atlantic Bamboo Rats are born precocial and large-sized. One 600g female was found with two near-term embryos weighting 60 g and 62 g in February. Juveniles have delayed dispersal, staying in parents’ home ranges until near or at adult size.

Coypus are aquatic; they are semi-fossorial and build complex burrows. They are primarily a lowland animal but may occur up to 1200 m in the Andes.","Coypus feed preferentially on semi-aquatic and aquatic plants but opportunistically may consume waterside terrestrial vegetation, especially in winter. Dietary items include stems, leaves, roots, and sometime bark; they sometimes use immersed branches or logs as feeding platforms. Forepaws are used to manipulate and hold food items. In Chile, Coypus consumed 700-1500 g (mean 1100 g) of plant matter per day, which represent daily intake equalto ¢.25% of body mass. Where populations occur near agricultural plots, individuals can be responsible for considerable damage by consuming cereals or other cultivated plants. Coypus are coprophagous in natural and captive situations, an activity usually performed at night.","Given large body mass and shortlife span (averaging 6-3 years), the Coypu has long gestation of 127-139 days. Age atfirst parturition is 6-15 months; parturition is usually followed by estrus within two days postpartum, with mean postpartum interval of 2-1 weeks. The Coypuis polyestrous, and length of estrus is 5-60 days, with some healthy females showing no sign of estrus over the course of several months. This variation may be related to ovulation induced by coitus. Cholesterol and ketosteroid levels increase incrementally as ovaries of young females develop. During estrus, amounts of these hormones increase in adrenal cortex and ovary. In pregnant females, these hormones are present only in very small amounts. There are 3-17 corpora lutea, usually a higher number than actual implanted embryos, suggesting that the Coypu is polyovular. In introduced populations in the USA, Coypus are non-seasonal breeders, with peak birth rates in December—January and June-July in Louisiana and January, March, May, and October in Oregon. Mean litters in Oregon had 3-6 young (maximum 1-12 young), with a decline in winter. Litters are larger in regions with higher habitat productivity. For unknown reasons, embryos are almost always implanted in left horn of the uterus. Mean body mass of young at birth is nearly 225 g, and neonates rapidly grow during the first five months oflife (growth rates of 0-0116-0-0120 g/day). Neonatal growth rate may be affected by temperature and habitat disturbances. Lactation of feral Coypu in England lasts 7-7 weeks. In captivity, young nursed for c¢.2 months and were able to survive if weaned after 32 days. Milk of the Coypu contains 41:5% dry matter, 27-9% fat, 13-7% protein, and 0-5% sugar, with the remainder being ash. In Maryland, USA, annual productivity was 8-1 young/female,likely related to food availability and abundance, predator abundance, weather conditions, and diseases. When environmental conditions remain stable and good, meanlittersize was 2-7 young, and females produced an average of 15 young/year. Females Coypus may “practice” birth control by spontaneous abortion when litter size is small or iflitter consists only of female embryos. In these cases, link between embryo disc and decidua basalis is destroyed, leading to death of an embryo and its disc destruction (up to 25% reabsorptions).","The Coypu is essentially nocturnal, with activity usually initiated at dusk and ending before daylight in early morning. Most daily activity is spent feeding, swimming, and grooming. During hottest period of the day, Coypus sleep in their burrows, in the sun, in the water, or on their feeding platforms. Individuals build burrows with multiple entrances; some tunnels are 6 m in length (range 1-6 m).",,"Classified as Least Concern on The [UCN Red List. The Coypu is widespread and abundant within its native habitat in southern South America. At high density, Coypus can damage agricultural crops but only limitedly. It is also regarded as a pest in some regions due to destruction ofriverbanks, disruption of drainage systems, damage to crops (e.g. rice, sunflower, corn, cowbane, great water dock, and diverse crop roots), and damage to native plant communities. Its wide distribution in its native and introduced lands, occurrence in several national parks over in its native distribution but also in Europe and North America support the current listing.

This wide trophic habitat spectrum makes Desmarest’s Hutia s one of the most adaptable echimyids. Some populations have specializations for red mangrove habitats, where they become nearly arboreal compared with their terrestrial and scansorial counterparts in other Cuban habitats. Usually, Desmarest’s Hutias favor limestone cliffs or karst systems where they can find suitable resting sites. In forest habitats, they most commonly use tree cavities as shelters, but they also build nests in vines or liana tangles among branches.","Desmarest’s Hutias usually forage on tender leaves,leaving leaf petioles on trees and primarily focusing on limbs. They also consume marine crustaceans, mollusks, and algae. They were reported to hunt and eat small Anolis lizards (A. porcatus and A. sagrei), human leftovers, and different food items encountered on their home ranges. Desmarest’s Hutias that live in red mangroves are strictly arboreal and specialize on red mangrove leaves. Several populations occur on small keys, where they are often seen swimming or foraging near the water. R. Borroto and C. A. Woods in 2012 followed populations of the different subspecies, recording detailed records of their foraging behaviors and proportions of plant items consumed. In southern Isla de la Juventud, subspecies ciprianoiforaged on 14 plant families, including 14 species, preferring species in the subclass Rosidae (65%). In coastal and sub-coastal vegetation communities in the Cabo Corrientes Natural Reserve, subspecies pilorides foraged on 15 families, including 20 species, also preferring Rosidae (45%) but also eating substantial proportions of Arecidae (20%) and Dilleniidae (15%). In secondary habitats in Sierra del Chorillo, pilorides foraged on 35 species, including 22 shrubs, with Rosidae (50-8%) and Asteridae (21%) being the most common food items. Coprophagy also appears to be common.","Gestation of Desmarest’s Hutia lasts 75-153 days, with an interbirth interval of c.16 days. Three litters per year can occur if conditions are good and food is not limited, but two litters were common in several studies. Litter sizes are 1-3 young, with rare cases of 4-6 embryos; near-term young weigh up to 250 g. Uterine scares typically numbered two, but three were reported in one case. Young nursed for c.153 days and become sexually mature at about ten months old. Desmarest’s Hutias have no special reproductive seasons, and females become pregnant throughout the year. Sexual maturity of females was correlated to body size; individuals weighing more than 2-1 kg had marked corpora lutea and perforated vagina. Ovaries from female Desmarest’s Hutias have high numbers of corpora lutea on very small ovaries that were three times smaller than those of Bushy-tailed Hutias ( Mesocapromys melanurus ): 0-8-2-5 mm for Desmarest’s Hutia vs. 2-7-1 mm in Bushy-tailed Hutias.","Desmarest’s Hutia is essentially nocturnal, with some crepuscular activity. Individuals are occasionally seen moving about during the day, especially in captivity. In some areas, individuals are arboreal and diurnal, staying at the sun and foraging on leaves on the ground. The activity patterns vary depending on habitats occupied.",,"Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. This classification of Desmarest’s Hutia results from its relatively large distribution that includes some protected areas and its ability to maintain high densities. Nevertheless, status of some subspecies is poorly known and requires additional investigations for accurate conservation assessment and, if necessary, action. Desmarest’s Hutias are important in the lives of Cuban people, serving as a significant source of meat for local people; they are often kept as pets.

In the northernmost part of the range, Wolverines (Gulo gulo), Eurasian Lynxes (Lynx lynx), Gray Wolves (Canis lupus), and foxes (Vulpes spp.) are the main predators, in that order; in Yakutia, the Yellow-throated Marten (Mantesflavigula) tends to be the most important. They are heavily infested with ectoparasites, including mites and fleas, and in the Far East, 100% are infested with larvae of Cordylobia inexspectata ( Calliphoridae ), a fly related to blowflies, a single individual musk-deer having as many as 2000 larvae.","In the northern part of the range, Siberian Musk-deer feed on lichens all year round, these forming 60-91% of the weight of stomach contents; in winter, they also eat sprigs of small bushes, conifer needles, moss, dry grass, and rhododendron leaves; in spring and summer, they eat vascular plants.","Body mass is lowest in June and at its maximum in autumn, when rutting begins. Testis volumeis at its maximum in the early rut (November-December), and the musk gland is at its maximum in November. The full rut takes place in December—January, less frequently February-March. Three-quarters of the females breed every year, the rest only once in two or three years or less. The pre-copulation phase, as judged by the male’s reaction to female urine marks, lasts 15-18 days; the true mating period lasts only 52-64 hours, and the phase of estrus when copulation occurs lastsjust 12-24 hours. Gestation is 182-194 days, with a mean of 187. During courtship, a male first leaves musk marks on the female’s home range, then gradually approaches, then pursues her. Before copulation, the male smells the female’s genitals and occasionally makes the flehmen gesture (corners of the mouth open, pulling back the midline of the upper lip to permit passage of olfactory molecules into the vomeronasal organ); most females rub the side of the neck of the male with their caudal area and look back. A series of copulations takes place, interspersed with resting or feeding. Most births (70%) occur in the first ten days ofJune. The newborns weigh 460-635 g. Meanlitter size overall is 1:7-1-8; i.e. there is a preponderance of twins. In different regions, the rate of multiple births seems slightly different: in East Sayan, twelve triplet, 50 twin, and 28 singleton births were recorded; in Yakutia,six twin and three singleton births. The sex ratio at birth in twins in the Altai region is 73-82% male; overall, however, sex ratios at birth are equal. Births occur during the day. Neonates stand 16-28 minutes after birth, walk after 28-47 minutes, and suckle after 11-92 minutes. They lie hidden for 12-15 days, and are on their own 80-90% of the time, the mother returning to feed them just once or twice a day for the first month, and after that only once a day. They begin to eat lichen and grass at 15-18 days. Lactation lasts on average four months, occasionally up to six months. The mother—young socialties last till the end of lactation. Juvenile mortality during first three or four months varies from 10-14% in the Far East to 17% in Transbaikalia. Males reach sexual maturity at 10-18 months, females at 8-9 months. Some females remain fertile until 7-12 years of age; in captivity, they remain fertile for longer, up to age 15-17. Mean life expectancy in nature is 5-7 years, which of course reflects the high infant and juvenile mortality, as adults in the wild may live to twelve years.","They are active, nervous animals; sudden high lookout jumps are made, especially by females. Most activity takes place at dusk and dawn. A musk-deer can travel 3-7 km during night foraging, usually returning to the same lair every morning. An individual’s home range will be between 200 ha and 300 ha in size, and muskdeer observe the boundaries quite strictly. In the second half of winter the extent of the home range is ratherless, and seasonal migrations,if they exist at all, are minimal.",,"CITES Appendix II.

Chinese Alpine Musk-deer live in highelevation bush, where the mean annual temperature is around 3-7°C and often falls below freezing; they prefer shrubby habitats to meadows. They inhabit shaded slopes with better shelter and less disturbance, the steeper slopes at greater than 30°. The elevation of their habitat is typically 4000-4500 m, only sometimes going below 4000 m . Annual rainfall varies from about 200 mm to as much as 450 mm or more. Musk-deer population density varies from 3-9 ind/km? in the more arid habitats to 71-11 ind/km? where the rainfall is highest; density is lower where there is heavy snow cover. Densities in dwarf forest and shrub are highest, but more continuous dense shrub is avoided, and patchy shrub has the highest densities among habitat types. Where there are more competitors, such as Serow and Goral, and more grazing by domestic herds, and of course more poaching, densities are again lower.","The diet contains the leaves of 46 species (mostly shrubs and forbs), flowers of 30 species, shoots and stems of 16 species, and seeds ofsix species; the proportion of leaves and tender shoots is highest in spring and summer, of buds and flowers higher in late summer, and of the leaves, twigs, and seeds of forbs and shrubs higher later in the year.","In the Xinglong Mountain National Nature Reserve, east of Qinghai Lake, births occur from May to July, when rainfall and temperature are highest; the younger females (less than two years old) have their birth season more spread out than the more mature females. Compared to the wild, in captivity the birth season is longer and begins later. The twinning rate is lower than in the Siberian Musk-deer, only two in twelve births. The neonates weigh 700-750 g at three days old. Lactation lasts for two months; the young begin browsing at 20 days.","Very little is known about activity patterns, but they have been reported to sleep during the day in a form, which is made by scraping out a shallow depression in the ground, which just fits the body when the animalis crouching low.",,"CITES Appendix I, except Chinese populations which are listed in Appendix II.

In Kedarnath, musk-deer tend to be in the open pastures on northern slopes at night. These slopes are warmer, more sheltered, and less exposed during the night. They are found on warmer, more sunny southern slopes during the day, when they rest more in shrub cover. The preferred slope angle is 30—-40°.","Diet in winter consists 39% of leaves of trees and shrubs (half of this being Rhododendron), 16% forbs (half of this being Senecio), 7% grasses, 2% ferns, 15% moss, and 21% lichen. In spring and summer, the diet consists mostly of forbs and lichen; it is mostly forbs and leaves in autumn. This contrasts with the Siberian Muskdeer, whose diet is so heavily composed oflichen.","Latrines are most frequently used during the autumn rut. The milky-yellow musk, which is produced most strongly between May and July, may be conveyed in the urine of males, and stains it pink or red because it mixes with slough from the inner wall of the sac. Pasting on stems by the caudal gland occurs throughout the winter range, especially during the rut. Gestation length is 196-198 days; the newborn weigh 600 g . The twinning rate of only one in six births seems lower than other species, except perhaps the Alpine Musk-deer.","Overall, 41% of the time is spent active, mainly at night, 59% resting, mainly by day. They are relatively silent, but hiss when alarmed; they squeal when captured or attacked by a predator. Males make a metallic rustling noise, probably by tooth grinding, in aggressive interactions. There is a contact bleat of the young to its mother. Stotting, like a gazelle,is frequent during vigilance behavior. Females seem to be more wary than males, and often flee for up to 100 m before stopping and looking back; males have a shorter median flight distance, but they hiss less and tend to look back more when fleeing.

Bracken fern (Pteridium aquilinum) and sword fern (Polystichum munitum) are staples of their diet yearround, but they also eat leaves, bark, and twigs of a variety of other plants as available, apparently specializing in plants toxic to other herbivores. When other food sources are scarce in winter, conifer stems and needles are important sources of food, despite their poor food quality. The Mountain Beaver will pull entire plants underground for consumption, but it will also climb a few metersinto trees to collect and eat stems and leaves. In autumn, hay piles are constructed outside burrow entrances that are used for nesting material and food.

Declines were probably driven by several interacting processes, including loss and conversion of habitat for agricultural or pastoral usage, changed fire regimes, disease, competition with feral herbivores and, perhaps most importantly, predation by feral cats (Felis catus) and Red Foxes (Vulpes vulpes). Despite its gloomy status, the very few sites that now support this bandicoot are protected from predators (three sites in Western Australia are offshore islands; the site in South Australia is a predator-free reserve). All sites are regularly monitored and managed and, in consequence, numbers have increased. Plans are being made to remove the feral cat from several islands off the coast of Western Australia, and this would allow further translocations to take place. Present island populations are not necessarily problemfree. On Bernier, for example, an unknown virus has emerged that causes sometimes fatal carcinomas and papillomas, and genetic diversity is likely to be low.

In Tasmania, this bandicoot occurs in native and exotic grasslands, woodland, and open forest with a grassy understory, and also in farmland and cultivated cropland. Nest is lined and constructed from grass and other debris in depression on ground surface or under cover of shrubs.","Some food is taken from the ground surface, including seeds, fallen fruits, insects, and small vertebrates, and some is excavated. Animals use their strong and stoutly clawed forefeet to dig conical holes to depths of 15-20 cm, uncovering earthworms, larvae, bulbs, tubers, roots, and subterranean fungi. Diet changes seasonally, reflecting shifts in the availability of different foods throughoutthe year.","Reproductive activity usually begins in winter and continues to early summer, presumably when food resources are most readily available, but in Victoria some females have been recorded breeding year-round. Females carry litters of 1-5 young (2-3 more usual), with larger litters usually produced in spring rather than at other times. Eight nipples are present, young in successive litters within a season attaching to nipples that have regressed in size from previous use. Gestation is just 12-5 days; young leave the pouch at 48-53 days, and are weaned at c.60 days.

Most time is spent in foraging, but males probably spend relatively more time than females in patrolling their home ranges. Animals return to their nests before dawn.",,"Classified as Near Threatened on The IUCN Red List. Exhibits a decreasing population trend. Historically, this species occurred from southeastern South Australia east to Melbourne area of Victoria, but in this region it now persists, in very small numbers, only in southern Victoria. It is known also from subfossil material from Flinders and Hunter islands, in Bass Strait, but no longer occurs there. In Tasmania, it has declined to low numbers in the Midlands region in recent decades, and its distributional strongholds now are in south-eastern and north-western Tasmania. It occurs also on Bruny Island and has been introduced to Maria Island. Declines in the Midlands were driven by loss of habitat and the intensification of agricultural and pastoral activity, and probably also by increased predation pressure that arose from predators switching their focus from the European Rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) to the Eastern Barred Bandicoot after rabbit-control began, in 1950s. There is also concern that, as populations of the native Tasmanian Devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) continue to crash following the spread of a contagious facial tumor disease, numbers of feral cats (Felis catus) are increasing and placing bandicoots and other native animals under great stress. Introduction of the Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes) to Tasmania, in what was probably a deliberate act of “bioterrorism” in late 1990s, will, if this carnivore becomes established, act further to drive populations of present species to very low levels. In Victoria, this peramelid occupied a shrinking range for much of 20"" century before the last known wild population was extirpated, in 2002. Many factors have been attributed to the decline, including loss of habitat for agriculture or development, habitat degradation due to livestock and introduced feral herbivores such as the European Rabbit, deliberate persecution from landholders, inadvertent poisoning through pesticides and herbicides, diseases such as toxoplasmosis, and predation by introduced carnivores. Predation appears to have been the prime cause of its final expiration in the wild in mainland Australia. Fortunately, however, before it was lost altogether, a few individuals were removed from the wild for breeding in captivity, and these have provided the founders for subsequent reintroduction attempts. The Victorian form now persists in three sites where it is protected from predation: Mount Rothwell Biodiversity Interpretation Centre, Hamilton Community Parklands, and Woodlands Historic Park. It has been reintroduced to a furtherfive sites but, after initial breeding successes, combinations of drought and predation from feral cat and, especially, Red Fox drove these populations to extinction. In 2012, the bandicoot was introduced to French Island, the largest island in Victoria (170 km?), in a pilot trial. Males were sterilized and animals retrapped at the conclusion of the trial; a decision about a broader-scale release is yet to be made. French Island has suitable habitat for this peramelid and has the major advantage that it is fox-free. Recovery efforts in Victoria have been intensive for more than 25 years, and involve many dedicated individuals and organizations. As a result, the mainland form is likely to be kept in existence for the foreseeable future, albeit in wildlife parks, zoological gardens, and predator-free compounds. Until the scourge of the cat and the Red Fox can be overcome, large wild populations are very unlikely to be seen again. The Near Threatened classification for this species on The [UCN Red List was made in 2008. It is unlikely to receive such a sanguine assessment when it is reviewed again in future.",Bryant & Jackson (1999) | Dickman (2012) | Driessen et al.

On Huon Peninsula it has been recorded at 3900 m; here, trees are stunted or absent, and vegetation is dominated by herbs, shrubs, tree ferns, and tussock grassland. Nest sites have not been described in any detail, but anecdotal accounts suggest that the animals rest temporarily under piles of leaf litter and other debris in sheltered sites on forest floor.","Has been anecdotally reported to eat figs and fallen pandan fruits ( Pandanus , Pandanaceae ). There is no quantitative information on the diet but, as with many other peramelids,it is assumed to be omnivorous.","Females with pouch young have been collected during March, June, August-September, November, and December.

General reports from trappers also indicate that this bandicoot is most likely to be captured after becoming active in the early evening between 19:00 h and 21:00 h.",,"Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. The population trend is not known. This is an uncommon but widespread species. Because of its broad distribution and occurrence in areas that are formally protected or not disturbed,it is assumed to be reasonably secure.

Declines have occurred in drier, inland areas near S edge of range of race torosus . While the species continues to decline owing to development, habitat loss, and changes in fire regimes, and overhunting for bushmeat in New Guinea, the declines are mostly local. The larger size of this bandicoot means that it is at less risk of predation from the feral cat (Felis catus), although it still falls prey to Red Foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and domestic and wild dogs (Canis).

Recently burnt sites may be exploited for the regenerating food and shelter resources that they provide. Simple nests are formed under dense vegetation, under the skirts of grass trees (Xanthorrhoea spp., Xanthorrhoeaceae ), and occasionally in shallow burrows; plantlitter, soil, and other debris may be used as construction materials to help enclose the nest. This species used to occur in more open habitats, but is probably restricted to areas with dense ground cover that provide shelter from introduced predators such as the Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes) and the domestic cat (Felis catus).","Insects, small vertebrates (lizards, frogs, rodents), bird eggs, fruit, green plant material, and fungi are all eaten. In several studies invertebrates have been the dominant food item, but the relative importance of each food type varies with season and locality. Most foraging occurs at night, animals using their hearing to detect surface-active prey and their sense of smell to detect buried prey. Digs characteristic conical holes in topsoil when buried prey has been located, providing a ready and reliable means of determining whether the species is present at a site.","Females attain sexual maturity at 4-5 months and males at six months.

With the exception of races affinis and perhaps nauticus, the distributions of all subspecies have been fragmented and reduced in recent decades, this being especially marked in south-eastern Australia. The species occurs in conservation reserves throughout its range, but is susceptible to predation from introduced Red Fox and feral cat, and to loss of habitat in non-reserved areas. Nominate subspecies and Tasmanian endemic race affinis can be considered near threatened owing to depressive effects of predators and habitat loss or alteration, and Nuyts Archipelago form nauticus is vulnerable owing to the small size and restricted area of its population. Cape York subspecies peninsulae has small area of occupancy, but is abundant within its small range and considered to be of least concern. Likewise, race fusciventer in Western Australia is considered to be of least concern; it has declined in the past, but has achieved partial recovery since mid-1990s owing to large-scale and highly successful campaigns to reduce Red Fox numbers. Programs to reduce impacts of introduced predators are currently underway also in Victoria, South Australia, and New South Wales, and these should help to guard the security of the species in future.",Ashby et al.

This species was once widespread in interior of Australia, but is now confined to high-rainfall areas of north-western Kimberley (including Augustus and Uwins islands), Barrow Island and Middle Island, off Pilbara coast, all in Western Australia, with an isolated outpost on Marchinbar Island, off N Northern Territory. It is considered to have a declining population trend. Sparsely distributed on mainland Western Australia, where population declines recently recorded. No estimates available for Augustus or Uwins, but the species is said to be sparse on former and relatively common on latter. It appears to be secure on Barrow, where at least 20,000 individuals estimated, and reasonably safe on Middle (c.1000) and Marchinbar (c.1400). Introductions or reintroductions from these populations to two small Wessel Group islands (Guluwuru and Raragala islands) off N Northern Territory, and to Doole Island, Hermite Island, and Lorna Glen in Western Australia, should provide insurance that these forms will remain secure. These sites are conservation reserves or Indigenous Protected Areas and are monitored on a regular or ad hoc basis. Mainland populations of this bandicoot continue to decline owing to predation from domestic or feral cats (Felis catus), habitat loss due to such practices as mining, and inappropriate changes to the fire regime that reduce vegetation cover and expose animals to increased risk of predation. Monitoring takes place at some mainland sites such as Mitchell Plateau and Artesian Range Sanctuary, in Western Australia, with active research and management in place at latter site to mitigate effects of changed fire regimes.

Pronounced seasonal variation in the amount of each food type consumed probably reflected changes in food availability. More limited information for New Guinea suggests that diet there is similar. Food obtained from forest floor or by excavation; as with many other peramelids, this species’ presence can often be detected by the finding of conical holes 20-30 cm deep that the animals have dug with their powerful forelimbs.","In Iron Range study, females carried pouch young between November and May, 80-100% of females carrying young during peak of wet season from January to March.

It prefers secondary forest, grassland, and garden habitats nearvillages, rather than primary forest, and at higher elevations is restricted increasingly to disturbed habitats. Recorded also as using canegrass thickets, sago swamps, and coffee and banana plantations. Radio-tracking studies show that animals exploitsites with recent tree-falls, fallen fruit, rotting logs, and dense ground-level vegetation for foraging, and use sites on forest floor for nests. They do not have fixed preferences for a particular type of nest; they nest in hollow logs, tree stumps, piles of leaves, and balls of grass, and in shallow, deliberately constructed burrows with two openings that run for up to 4 m below forest floor.","The few stomachs that have been examined suggest that this species, while omnivorous, may consume more fruit than other well-studied peramelids. Local people often set traps or wait by fruiting trees to capture foraging animals, and diet samples have been found to contain seeds and pulp from such fruits as banana, fig, and pandan ( Pandanus , Pandanaceae ). Nonetheless, the species also eats snails or slugs, surface-active invertebrates, and prey such as larvae in rotting wood. Shallow foraging pits indicate that subterranean prey, such as earthworms, are also eaten. There is some evidence that foraging is focused in areas with dense cover, animals moving quickly through open sites to access new sources of food.","This echymipera is highly fecund and breeds throughout the year. In one long-term study in Karimui region, Chimbu Province, 56 of 85 females were found to be carrying pouch young, intervals between successive litters averaging 120 days. Similar breeding rates (66-71%) have been reported from other localities, including Crater Mountain Wildlife Management Area in Eastern Highlands Province. Females become reproductively active at a weight of ¢.380 g, not long after becoming independent, and testes in males can reach mature size when animals weigh 300 g. Up to three pouch young (average 1-6) were usually present in pouches of females in the Karimui study, similar to reported litter sizes of c¢.1-5 and 1-7 in other areas. Females have six nipples in a rear-opening pouch and, as with other peramelids, young attach to nipples that have not been recently used but which have regressed from an earlier litter.","In Crater Mountain Wildlife Management Area, individuals became active between 18:00 h and 20:00 h, showed peak activity between 20:00 h and 02:00 h, and became much less active again between 04:00 h and 06:00 h. About three-quarters of fixes on animals radio-tracked at night indicated that these were active and foraging or were patrolling their homes ranges. In contrast, 86% of radio-fixes obtained by day showed that animals were at rest. In anotherstudy, carried out in Baiyer River Wildlife Sanctuary, Western Highlands Province, animals were strictly nocturnal and often used the same pathways when traveling through the forest. Both studies found that the animals use multiple shelters or nest sites between successive days, and sometimes return to these sites at night for short periods.",,"Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. The population trend is stable. This speciesis the most abundant of New Guinea peramelids. It is very widely distributed, not restricted to particular habitats, occurs in several protected areas, and can be abundant even in places where it is hunted. Anecdotal observations indicate that local populations can be depleted by depredation byferal cat (Felis catus) and feral dogs. Nevertheless, even if there are local reductions in abundance, it is very unlikely that overall population is declining at a rate that might qualify this peramelid for listing as Near Threatened. While nominate subspecies appears to be most secure, oriomo of Fly River region and the two endemic island subspecies have been subject to more limited research in recent years.

In the Plains States, these skunks inhabit riparian woodlands and areas of vegetation along fences. They also are found in brushy and rocky habitats, but avoid wetlands. They have been observed on sandy soils and beaches in Florida . Eastern Spotted Skunks seem to prefer habitat with extensive vegetative cover, as this cover provides protection from various predators. They den in protected, dark, dry holes including natural crevices in trees, and will den off the ground to an elevation of seven meters in hollow trees. They dig their own burrows, or den in holes previously occupied by other animals, in talus slopes, haystacks, under houses or rocks, and in the walls of houses or barns. They prefer warm holes in the winter and cool dens in the summer, and will change den sites to accommodate these needs.","Eastern Spotted Skunks forage primarily at night. They are secretive and not often seen. These skunks are exceptional mousers and do farmers a great service when they forage around barns and buildings. They are omnivores, but tend to be more carnivorous than Mephitis or Conepatus . The diet consists mainly of insects, small mammals, birds, and birds’ eggs. Like a center hiking an American football, the skunk uses its front paws to throw an egg through its back legs in order to crack the shell. These skunks also will eat fruits and vegetables in the summer and fall when they are available.","Reproduction in the Eastern Spotted Skunk is different from that in the Western Spotted Skunk. The main breeding season for this species is during March and April, although some individuals may breed again in July, August, or September to produce a second litter. Gestation is estimated to be from 50 to 65 days, with only a two-week period of delayed implantation. First-season litters are produced in late May and early June. Litter size averages five but ranges from 2-9 kits. Young are born naked or with sparse, fine, black and white pelage. The claws are well- developed at birth. The eyes and ears open at about 30 days and teeth become visible at 32 days. They can make squealing vocalizations at an early age. The young are weaned after about two months.","They are generally nocturnal. They usually avoid moonlit nights. On nights when the moon is not out they normally have two periods of activity. They will come out soon after sunset and again before sunrise. They will be active throughout the night as well. Eastern Spotted Skunks have been observed during the day on rare occasions. Spotted skunks are quite agile and are capable of climbing. This agility also can be observed in their threat behavior as they are able to perform front handstands. When faced with a potential predator, the skunk rushes forward, then stands on its forepaws with its hind end elevated off the ground. This behavior has been reported to last for up to eight minutes in short, 2-5 second bursts of handstanding. However, a young, captive animal from a wildlife rehabilitation effort was observed crouching under a couch on all fours until a domestic cat came into the room. The skunk rushed out from under the couch toward the cat. As soon as its tail cleared the cushion it went into a handstand/run. The cat began to trot away. The skunk followed on its frontfeet, bouncing around a table, about 1-5 m and then jumped up on a stand approximately 6 cm off the ground, ran along the stand, hopped off the end and continued to chase the cat to the other end of the room. The cat finally ran off and the skunk dropped down on all fours and went back under the couch. Spotted skunks have been reported to spray from the hand-stand position, but they usually drop down and face the predator with both ends in a “U” shape. The handstand is usuallyjust a threat behavior used to drive off the predator.",,"Notlisted in CITES. Classified as Least Concern in The [UCN Red List. However, there has been concern over the lack of observations of this species throughout its range in the last few decades. Population densities of Eastern Spotted Skunks were believed to be low when settlers first arrived on the Great Plains. When small farm operations flourished there prior to the 1920s, spotted skunks became more numerous as farm buildings provided shelter as well as a supply of mice and rats. When the small farms gave way to larger operations, the density of spotted skunks became lower. Today, the Eastern Spotted Skunk is considered to be threatened in many of the states within its historical range. Natural predators of spotted skunks include larger carnivores such as domestic dogs, coyotes, foxes, feral cats and bobcats, and birds of prey such as owls. Ectoparasites found on Eastern Spotted Skunks include fleas and ticks, and endoparasites include various tapeworms, roundworms, and coccidian protozoans. Humans also are known to be a major cause of mortality because of the number of skunks hit by cars. Pneumonia and coccidiosis are diseases that have been reported in this species. Rabies has been reported, but rarely.

Rodents are not taken as frequently as by other spotted skunks, but may be selected as alternative prey when the availability of arthropods is low. Spiny pocket mice are common in the tropical dry forest, and during the dry season, their density is high. During this season rodents also may be easier to detect due to the desiccation ofleaflitter. Birds are rarely taken by these skunks and plant material is less likely to be consumed, although, highly digestible fruits may be eaten. Pygmy Spotted Skunks use food sources such as ants, beetles, and spiders in relation to their abundance in the environment. However, some invertebrates, such as insect larvae, millipedes and centipedes, are selected in higher abundance. True bugs (Hemiptera) tend to be avoided as do crickets and grasshoppers (Orthoptera). Pygmy Spotted Skunks will eat cockroaches (Blattaria) during the dry season; they may select food items in response to seasonal variation in prey abundance.","Breeding occurs from April through August, with most births occurring around July and August. Gestation usually lasts from 43-51 days, and there may be a short period of delayed implantation. More than one litter per year may be produced. The number of young perlitter can range from one to six in this species. The young are born with fine white hair, but the skin pigmentation pattern is similar to that of adults. Newborn kits weigh about 7 g , and their eyes and ears do not open until they are 29-32 days old. Most of the teeth are present at 47 days.","They are nocturnal and den underground or in fallen logs, among rocks, or simply under dense vegetation. They will use dens dug by other animals such as gophers, squirrels, armadillos, and turtles. They use pathways and stream beds to move to and from bodies of water. Much of their activity occurs below the leaf litter or brush, where they search for the burrows of small rodents. Pygmy Spotted Skunks stomp their feet when threatened. They have been observed doing a partial handstand similar to other species of spotted skunks. Anal secretions are usually only released as a last resort.",,"Not listed with CITES. Classified as Vulnerable in The IUCN Red List. This skunk is locally abundant in certain areas, but is considered to be vulnerable throughout much of its range in Mexico due to habitat destruction as a result of tourist resort and road construction. These animals also have been stuffed and sold as souvenirs. Skulls have been recovered from barn owl pellets, and snakes and other carnivores probably prey on Pygmy Spotted Skunks.

It is most common in arid lowlands, but also occurs in deciduous or ponderosa forest, forest edges, pastures, rocky canyons, and riparian habitats. Hooded Skunks use similar habitats to Striped Skunks, but are found more often in scrub and urban habitats. Hooded Skunks occur from sea level to 3110 m , in low elevation desert areas (below 2500 m ), in rocky canyons, or in heavily vegetated streamsides and valleys, often in association with mesquite, pine—oak, and other shrubs and grasses. Hooded Skunks appearto prefer intermediate elevationsin rockyslopes,at the bases ofcliffs, or on the rocky sides of arroyos, but are also encountered in heavy growth of weeds and shrubs in riparian areas. Dense, brushy cover of stream sides may be important for this species. Hooded Skunks den in holes dug in the ground, rock crevices, and holes in logs. They have even been observed denning more than 1 m above ground in trees, but they are more likely to den on rocky hillsides. They prefer woodland habitats more than do Striped Skunks. In agricultural areas Hooded Skunks den along fencerows, beneath irrigation canals, and in heavily vegetated areas along streams. Hooded Skunks are less likely than Striped Skunks to den around human dwellings. However, radio-collared individuals were frequently located under buildings and sheds and in culverts.","The diet of this species consists primarily of insects (including beetles and grasshoppers), fruits, small vertebrates, and birds’ eggs. Hooded Skunks break chicken eggs by throwing them between their back legs rather than biting them. Vertebrates are taken opportunistically. When foraging, Hooded Skunk moves slowly, snuffling among leaves and pouncing on grasshoppers and beetles.","The reproductive biology of the Hooded Skunk is poorly known. Breeding likely takes place from mid-February to the end of March. Males have a baculum, and females have two pairs of inguinal, one pair of abdominal, and two pairs of pectoral mammae. Litter size ranges from 3-8. Females may nurse young through August.","Hooded Skunks remain active all year and have been trapped in the winter. The anal glands are used in self defense. One animal was observed spraying nine times in eleven seconds and again three more times 90 minutes later. The defensive behavior of Hooded Skunk is similar to that of Striped Skunk. Hooded Skunks are active after dusk and travel along rock walls, streambeds, and in weedy fields. They tend to be solitary except when females are raising young, although several may dine together at a feeding station. Females normally do not den together during the winter months.",,"Classified as Least Concern in The IUCN Red List. Little is known about the status of this species, but they may not be uncommon in some parts of their range in the SW USA . However, in Texas , there is concern about population levels and that the species may no longer occur in that state. In Mexico, they are very abundant and survive in human-altered habitats such as cultivated fields, pastures, and suburban areas. There is a need for more research on Hooded Skunks. During a four year study period in Arizona , survival rates of adult skunks were low (24-56%). Predation accounted for most of the mortality, but disease and parasites were contributing factors. Great horned owls (Bubo virginianus), mountain lions, bobcats, jaguars, and coyotes may kill Hooded Skunks. Captive Hooded Skunks have lived for at least eight years. Historically, the pelt has not been considered to be of great value,so this skunk has not been hunted to the extent that other species have. Its fur is very long, light, and of low economic value. The flesh has been used for food in some areas, and the fat and scent glands have been used for medicinal purposes. Roundworms (Physaloptera maxillaries), fleas ( Pulicidae ), and the nematode Skrjabingylus chitwoodorum occur in Hooded Skunks in Trans Pecos, Texas . A new species of Skrjabingylus (S. santaceciliae) was recently described in this skunk species. Rabies rarely is reported in Hooded Skunks; however, a case of rabies in this species has been documented. There is no reason to suspect that they do not contract the virus; more likely they go unnoticed or are misidentified as Striped Skunks. Hooded Skunks also are susceptible to feline distemper.

They can be found in open, exposed arcas, but prefer brushy, weedy stream and gulch bottoms or canyons. In open areas they will burrow into banks or even level ground and as a result are able to occupy many habitats. Other habitats where they can be found include a mixture of woodlands, brushy corners, and open fields broken by wooded ravines and rocky outcrops. They will also utilize cultivated areas, pasture, and hay crops. In other parts of their range they use wetlands surrounded by agricultural areas, grasslands, woodlot edges, fencelines, and refuse piles. Striped Skunks may not have a preference for any particular habitat as long as food and shelter are available.","Striped Skunks are opportunistic omnivores. With the exception of lima beans, most skunks will eat almost anything. They will feast primarily on insects, such as beetles, grasshoppers, crickets, moths, cutworms, caterpillars, bees, and wasps. They also will eat earthworms, snakes, snails, clams, crayfish, fish, frogs, mice, moles, rats, squirrels, wild fruits, grains, corn, nuts, birds’ eggs, carrion, and garbage. Striped Skunks use their long foreclawsto dig for insects and grubs. They will search in rotten or fallen logs for mice and insects. Around gardens they will forage forripe fruits and vegetables, but they primarily are looking for insects, and benefit gardeners by eating insects that can damage garden crops. They also will take advantage of any pet food left outside.","Striped Skunk usually breed from February through March and the young are born starting in April, but births can continue until early June. These skunks usually only go into estrus once a year. However,if a litter is lost early a second litter may be produced. Striped Skunks will breed in their first year, and young males will exhibit breeding behavior in mid- to late summerof their first year, although they are not yet in reproductive condition. Females are usually in estrus for about a week and a half. Striped Skunks are induced ovulators. Ovulation occurs between 40 and 50 hours after first insemination. Males will breed with many females given the opportunity. Most of the females become pregnant by the end ofthe breeding season. Gestation usually lasts from 59-77 days. Females that breed early in the season may undergo a short period of delayed implantation. Striped Skunks can have as many as twelve offspring perlitter, but the average is about 5-7. Females usually have twelve mammae, but the number can range from ten to15. Young skunks are born blind, deaf, and naked. Within a couple of days the black and white hairs cover the pink and white skin. They are born with their scent glands intact and are capable of spraying within the first week of birth. The early scent is more a gas than a liquid. The eyes and ears open after about 28 days (sometimes earlier). After about 6-8 weeks the young are weaned. They begin to forage and explore with mom at this time. By the end of summer or early fall the young begin to disperse.","Striped Skunks are crepuscular or nocturnal. In the northern part of their range they may go into a torpor (they are not true hibernators) during cold spells or when snow coveris particularly deep. However, in the southern parts of the range, they may actually be more active during the milder winters. When a Striped Skunk perceives a threat,its first responseis to run away. If that does not work, it will spray a noxious chemical from the anal scent glands. However, before spraying, skunks use a series of threat behaviors. They will stomp the ground with both front feet. Sometimes they will charge forward a few paces and then stomp or will edge backwards while dragging their front feet, all the while with the tail up in the air. Each scent gland has a nipple associated with it and skunks can aim and direct the spray with highly coordinated muscle control. When a skunk is being chased by a predator, but cannot see the predator, the spray is emitted as an atomized cloud that the predator must run through. This is the “shotgun” method and usually is enough to deter most predators.",,"Classified as Least Concern in The IUCN Red List. Striped Skunks are not considered for any kind of protection as they appear to be doing well throughout their range. Some of the earliest legislation to protect skunks, in the form of closed trapping seasons, was in New York in 1894. Farmers recognized that skunks were the only effective predators of the hop grub and their service in combating the grub made them valuable assets. Striped Skunks are known to harbor numerous ectoparasites and endoparasites, including fleas, lice, ticks, mites, and various helminth infestations. Intestinal roundworms, nematodes, and lung flukes have been reported. Parasite loads can be a major contributor to mortality. Skunks are a primary vector of rabies in some parts of their range. They also have been found to be infected with canine distemper, histoplasmosis, leptospirosis, listerosis, mycoplasma, pulmonary aspergillosis, sarcocystis, streptococcus, toxoplasma, tularemia, and West Nile Virus. Natural mammalian predators for skunks include humans, domestic dogs, coyotes, red foxes, lynx, bobcats, badgers, mountain lions, and fishers. Various birds of prey including great horned owls, eagles, crows, and vultures also will eat skunks. Turnover in skunk populations is high, so a large percentage of animals in any population consist of young of the year. The average lifespan for wild skunksis about 2-3-5 years. However, Striped Skunks kept in captivity live on average to about 8-12 years of age.",Bailey (1931) | Baird (1857) | Bangs (1895 | 1898a) | Bentler et al. (2007) | Blanton et al.

Classified as Least Concern in The IUCN Red List, but populations have been declining for many years throughout a major portion of its historical range in the USA . The eastern Texas subspecies, ftelmalestes, is presumed extirpated throughoutits range in the Big Thicket region. In his Biological Survey of Texas , V. Bailey wrote, “the white-backed skunk is said to be the commonest species, and under a trapper’s shed at a ranch on Tarkington Prairie in November, 1904,I saw eight or ten of their skins hanging up to dry with a small number ofskins of Striped Skunk.” No new specimens of this subspecies have been collected in the Big Thicket area of Texas since Bailey's report in 1905. A telling, albeit fictional, explanation for the skunk’s decline is provided by Larry McMurtry, in his novel Lonesome Dove. one of his characters meets a couple in NE Texas . “In the dusk it was hard to make out much about her except that she was thin. She was barefoot and had on a dress that looked like it was made from part of a cotton sack. ‘I gave twenty-eight skunk hides for her,’ the old man said suddenly”. A more likely cause for the decline of hog-nosed skunk populations may be found in the increase in the number of trappers or possibly in the increased number of feral hogs that have been introduced into the area. Feral hogs compete, to some degree, with several species of wildlife for certain foods. They eat a variety of items, including fruits, roots, mushrooms, and invertebrates, depending on the season. Their rooting behavior is competitive with the rooting behavior of hog-nosed skunks. Feral hogs can have detectable influences on wildlife and plant communities as well as domestic crops and livestock, extensively disturbing vegetation and soil. In southern Texas , where 95% of the native vegetation in the Rio Grande Valley in Texas has been transformed from subtropical plant communities to cotton, sorghum, sugar cane, vegetable crops, and citrus orchards, several additional hog-nosed skunk populations may now be extirpated. However, a population was found recently in southern Texas and currently is being studied. Because hog-nosed skunks generally are associated with rough rocky areas and brushy habitat, the conversion of native vegetation to row-crop agriculture may be partially responsible for the skunks’ decline. However, habitat modification may not be the primary cause of the observed decline, because specimens of this skunk have been collected in cultivated areas near Veracruz, Mexico . A more direct cause may be associated with use of pesticides in agriculture. Hog-nosed skunks are primarily insectivorous, and use of pesticides has increased throughout their range in conjunction with row-crop agriculture. In Colorado, no new specimens ofthis species have been collected since 1933. However, a road-killed animal was seen just south of the Colorado border in New Mexico in 2003. American Hog-nosed Skunks are taken by many predators, mainly large canids and felids, and by birds of prey. Additionally, the skunks support numerous parasites. External parasites include fleas ( Pulex ) and ticks (Ixodes texanus); intestinal parasites are roundworms (Psyalopteris maxillaris) and cestodes; and subcutaneous nematodes (Filaria martis) and Skrjabingylus chitwoodorum —infect the frontal sinuses. In west Texas, American Hog-nosed Skunks have been found infected with several species of helminth parasites, including Filaroides milks, Filaria taxidaea, Gongylonema sp., Macracanthorhynchus ingens, Mathevotaenia mephitis, Oncicola canis, Pachysentis canicola, Physaloptera maxillaris, and P. rara. In natural habitats, hognosed skunks are not known to survive for more than three or four years, but American hog-nosed skunks can live for 16 years or more in captivity.",Bailey (1905) | Beasom (1974) | Dalquest (1953) | Davis (1951) | Davis & Schmidly (1994) | Dragoo (1993) | Dragoo & Honeycutt (1999a | 1999b) | Dragoo & Sheffield (In press) | Dragoo et al.

The Hottentot Golden Mole occurs mainly in Grassland and Savanna biomes, with marginal intrusion into Fynbos and Nama Karoo biomes in its southern distribution. It is particularly abundant in moist soils near water sources but also occurs far from surface water if soilis friable enough for burrowing and invertebrate prey is abundant. The Hottentot Golden Mole generally occurs in regions with mean annual rainfall more than 500 mm. It is frequently associated with agricultural land, golf courses, and gardens but less common in exotic plantations.","The Hottentot Golden Mole is insectivorous, mainly feeding on subterranean invertebrates such as earthworms and insects. In captivity, they will eat snails and plant material (e.g. potatoes and bulbs), although their digestive tracts are not specialized for herbivory. In nature, more than 97% of diets contain only earthworms, and less than 3% contain variety of insect prey including carabid beetle larvae, slugs, snails, crickets, insect pupae, and spiders. Individuals can consume up to 90% of their body weight daily. Although they will drink water in captivity, they probably obtain their moisture requirements from food and dew in the wild.","Hottentot Golden Moles breed aseasonally, with peak reproductive activity in wet summer months. Females are polyestrous, with postpartum estrus, and male spermatogenesis is continuous, reflecting relatively constant microclimate of their subterranean niche. Litters have 1-3 young, but in most cases, females will carry one fetus in each uterine horn, giving rise to litters of two young. At birth, young are altricial, pale pink, and naked, except for a few hairs on foreheads and sides of muzzles. Ear openings are marked by small protuberances on sides of the head. Claws are well developed but soft. Neonates are ¢.47 mm long, weigh 4-5 g, and develop short dark brown dorsal pelage by juvenile size at 72 mm long and 17 g; ventral surfaces remain naked; and teeth are unerupted. Pale ventral pelage first appears at the late juvenile size at 80 mm long and ¢.27 g, and eviction from maternal burrows occurs at ¢.35—40 g.","Hottentot Golden Moles live almost exclusively underground, constructing superficial burrows for foraging and deeper permanent burrows for residence. Subsurface tunnels are ¢.3 cm deep and 4-6 cm in diameter. Residential burrows can penetrate as far as 1 m belowground and are relatively complex in form, comprising grassor leaf-lined spherical nesting chambers 10-50 cm deep and 15-20 cm in diameter, other chambers used as latrines, and deeper (29-94 cm deep) spiraling bolt holes. In friable soils, horny nose pads are predominantly used for digging subsurface tunnels, and foreclaws assist with digging deeper tunnels and foraging in heavier soils. Hottentot Golden Moles are estimated to burrow at rates of up to 1-1-5 m/h and up to 9 m daily. Foraging burrows are generally 9.5-240 m long and might be extended by 4-12 m/day, depending on friability of soil and abundance of prey. Excavated soil from deep burrows is pushed up to the surface as molehills or compacted into tunnel walls; superficial foraging burrows result in ridges on the surface. Hottentot Golden Moles are highly sensitive to disturbances and will retreat quickly from superficial burrows to deeper burrows or bolt-holesif disturbed. They sometimes are attracted to the surface by movements of worms and insects, and they might even emerge and move on the surface, usually only at night and when food is scarce. At these times, they can be vulnerable to predation by owls and other predators. Hottentot Golden Moles are significantly less active in winter than summer, burrowing deeper and often entering torpor during colder winter months. They are particularly active after rain, and daily activity tends to peak at sunrise, sunset, and midnight, with periods of activity of up to two hours and periods of inactivity of 3-5 hours. During heavy rainfall events, underground burrows can become flooded. Hottentot Golden Moles cope with these situations by swimming; they can maintain a certain degree of buoyancy due to a layer of air retained in their wet fur. Soil temperatures in burrow systems are 0-8-32°C, but optimal thermal conditions for activity are 23-33°C, corresponding with their thermoneutral zone. Ambient temperatures below 15°C or higher than 30°C lead to torpor, characterized by reduced metabolic rate and considerable energetic saving.",,"Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List.

Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, 1818,Island of Mauritius .","Much of sub-Saharan Africa, from Senegal E to W Ethiopia and S Somalia, and S to NE Namibia and E South Africa, including Bioko, Principe, São Tomé, Annobón, and Unguja (Zanzibar Archipelago) Is; also in Madagascar, Aldabra, Assumption, Comoros (Mayotte I), Mauritius, and Réunion Is.","Head-body c.76 - 88 mm, tail 15-28 mm, ear 12-22 mm, hindfoot 11-18 mm, forearm 58-65 mm; weight 20-36 g. There is no sexual dimorphism in general appearance and size, and both sexes have radio-metacarpal pouches. Dorsum of the Mauritian Tomb Bat appears to be grizzled due to tricolored hairs: whitish at tips, graybrown in middle, and pale brown at bases. Fur is sleek and close to body; it extends onto uropatagiumjust beyond point at which tail perforates the membrane. Venter is white, strongly contrasting dark appearance of dorsum. Sexually mature males have conspicuous gular pouch. Some adult females in Mozambique, Sudan, and Nigeria reportedly have gular sac and others do not, but when present, it is less developed than in males. In mature males, gular sac opens anteriorly and contains glands that produce secretions that pass through its anterior opening. Radio-metacarpal sacs are located at forward angles on each wing . These sacs are formed by fold ofskin stretched between radius and basaljoint ofmetacarpal offifth digit. Aspect ratio oflong, narrow wing is 8-2, which makes it difficult to maneuver in tight confines. Under experimental conditions, Mauritian Tomb Bats cannot manage a turn in a 1-m wide corridor. Metacarpals decline in length progressively from third to fifth digits. Second digit has only metacarpals, but there are two phalanges on third, fourth, and fifth digits. At rest, long narrow tip of wing is shortened as first phalanx of third digit folds forward and on top of metacarpal, while second phalanx folds down on bottom of first. Such folding ofwingtip facilitates efficient crawling on roost substrates. Posterior margin of interfemoral membrane (uropatagium) is supported on each side by strong calcar. Tail projects through middle of this membrane and above membrane as is typical in Emballonuridae . Ear is triangular. Tragus is ovalshaped and as broad (4-5 mm) as it is long. Long, thin postorbital processes of skull taper and curve down around eye sockets. Rounded braincase rises above plane of face, resulting in curved profile with little to no sagittal crest . Deep saucer-like depression in frontal area is apparent on face of live individuals. Posterior edge of palate ends abruptly at last molar, with gaps on inner edge of palate due to incomplete auditory bullae.","Moist savannas, open woodlands, and grasslands with more than 500 mm of rain per year, and riparian gallery forests and swamps along large rivers, from sea level to elevations of C.900 m. Mauritian Tomb Bats on Sao Tomé and Principe occur in cocoa plantations. Often found in anthropomorphic habitats (e.g. roosting under eaves of houses).","Mauritian Tomb Bats eat moths, alate termites {Macrotermes falciger) , butterflies, and other insects. Like other species of tomb bats, they fly high and fast. During wet season, radio-tracked individuals from the day roost at Babalala Picnic Area, Kruger National Park, flew up to 5 km from their day roost to nightly feeding areas. Individuals forage independently , but subadults appear to fly with mothers.","Given the large distribution of Mauritian Tomb Bats across the African continent, it is not surprising that they are polyestrous in wet tropical regions and monoestrous in more seasonal arid and temperate regions. Timing of parturition from region to region also varies depending on climate and latitude. In Zimbabwe, females were observed carrying a single young in October and were pregnant again in February; in northern Zaire, Tanzania, and Kenya, births occurred in April-May. After birth, single young cling to their mothers’ abdomens in flight, and they carry them until it can fly on their own. In tropical northern reaches of Kruger National Park, Mauritian Tomb Bats are migratory, regularly appearing in wet season at the Babalala Picnic Site to rear young but disappearing during dry season.","Mauritian Tomb Bats emerge after dark and actively forage for several hours thereafter. At Babalala Picnic Area, a roosting group of 3-8 adult bats arrive each wet season in this mopane forest/grassland region. They roost by day at tops ofwooden posts that support a thatch-covered, open-air, circular structure, singly or as a breeding pair, with an adult male and adult female on each post Mauritian Tomb Bats also roost on cliffwalls with overhanging rock shelves and trunks of large trees where deep shade is available. They rest against roost substrate in vertical head-down postures, clinging with feet and thumbs. The species produces a multi-harmonic HDC-QCF call, with low peak frequency of 25-9 kHz, narrow bandwidth of 2-8 kHz, and intermediate duration of 7-4 milliseconds.

Its diet includes flies, beetles, moths, and even butterflies that are active in late afternoon. Foraging habitats shift seasonally when Greater Sac-winged Bats cue on variation in insect phenology and abundance. They forage alone; individuals usually move from one feeding area to another after c.25-30 minutes.","Gestation of Greater Sac-winged Bats across Mexico and Central America begins near end of dry season, and one young is bom annually at onset of rainy season. Timing of parturition varies with climate across the distribution. Females carry young or leave them at hidden night roosts when they forage. Young are able to fly at two weeks old but continue to suckle for 10-12 weeks. Yearling females disperse to other roosting groups, but young males remain with parental roost groups, waiting their chance to succeed older males.","Greater Sac-winged Bats are crepuscular and can be seen in foraging areas in late afternoon, well before sunset, within shaded forest understories. This primary foraging activity occurs for c .3 hours into the night. A secondary foraging period occurs in early morning, and individuals return to day roosts soon after dawn. Mean flight speed is 5-8 m/s. Roost shelters include dimly lit cave entrances, trees hollows, boles and between plank buttresses, buildings, window screens of inhabited buildings, and undersides of bridges. The Greater Sac-winged Bat capably maintains appreciable temperature differentials with its environment . It usually remains normothermic and is alert and active in daytime roosts. It maintains a resting rate of metabolism that is high compared with small insectivorous bats in other families. It is likely that its diet of small, abundant insects provides enough energy year-round to permit a roosting strategy of alertness and vigilance in dimly lit shelters potentially vulnerable to predators. By maintaining individual distances from roost mates, groups of Greater Sac-winged Bats are able to simultaneously fly as an escape response, which would not be possible for bats that cluster tighdy because individuals on outer edges of a cluster must fly off first and those in the center of a cluster must wait for critical seconds before taking flight. Search-phase echolocation pulses of Greater Sac-winged Bats are relatively long (5-6 milliseconds) and paired. They are characterized by slight rise in frequency at onset of pulse, followed by a long F part, and terminated with slight decrease in frequency. Maximum energy in prey searching echolocation calls varies with geography at 42-50 kHz from populations in Belize, Costa Rica, and Panama.

Based on generalized behavior of these prey, Thomas’s Shaggy Bat might feed by gleaning insects from surfaces ofleaves and branches, taking slow-flying insects on the wing, or using a combination of these two strategies.",,Thomas’s Shaggy Bat is crepuscular and roosts in hollow trees and on tree trunks in forest understories. It emerges to forage in late afternoon and continues foraging into early night.

Extinct in the N Atlantic Ocean.",,"Primarily relatively shallow waters along edges of continental shelves from subtropical to polar latitudes and only occasionally open oceanic or pelagic habitats. Gray Whales frequent continental shelf waters along both sides of the North Pacific Ocean, including East China Sea, Yellow Sea, Sea of Okhotsk, Bering Sea, and Chukchi, Beaufort, and East Siberian seas in the Arctic Ocean. Gray Whales are highly migratory. When migrating, they may cross deep ocean and follow undersea mountain ranges and escarpments. In summer, they feed on the bottom of shallow continental shelves in high latitudes. In fall and spring, the western population of Gray Whalesis believed to migrate along the Pacific coast of the Far East from Russia to China. The larger eastern population migrates along the edge of the continental shelf of the Pacific coast of North America from Alaska to Mexico. In winter, Gray Whales congregate in coastal bays and lagoons that afford them protection from predation and warmer water for rearing young and mating. Their habit of frequenting relatively shallow continental shelf waters and coastal areas for feeding, migrating, and breeding is unique among mysticete whales. While capable of navigating deep ocean areas, Gray Whales migrate to and from their summer feeding and winter breeding areas along distinct corridors that follow within a few kilometers of the North American coast (for the eastern Gray Whale) and the eastern Asian coast (for some of the western Gray Whales). They disperse widely across the Arctic and polar seas during summer feeding, and they aggregate in shallow coastal areas, embayments and lagoons in subtropical latitudes for breeding and to give birth.","Primary summer feeding grounds of Gray Whales include the Gulf of Alaska, Bering Sea, Chukchi Sea, Beaufort Sea, East Siberian Sea, and Sea of Okhotsk, and they also exploit prey resources where they are found throughout their migratory distribution. They forage for patchy concentrations of prey found on relatively shallow (50 m or less) continental shelf areas that correspond with areas of high primary productivity supporting extensive benthic invertebrate communities. Gray Whales use suction feeding to exploit prey from the sea floor, but they can also feed on swimming prey by gulping and skimming prey from near the sea floor and ocean surface. Principal prey includes infaunal, tube-dwelling ampeliscid amphipods, polychaete worms, bivalves, swarming cumaceans, mysids, shrimps, krill, mobile amphipods, and shoals of clupeoid fish such as sardines and anchovies. An adult Gray Whale may consume ¢.220,800 kg of food at a rate of ¢.1200 kg/day for c.180 feeding days. Gray Whales do not feed extensively, or at all, during fall and spring migrations or while in their winter breeding areas. Fasting whales may lose up to 30% of their body fat during winter. This is especially critical for lactating females that are not feeding while nursing and caring for their offspring. Water is obtained from their food and metabolically from body fat. Warming of the Arctic Ocean due to global climate change and subsequent reduction in permanent sea ice has accelerated in recent decades and has affected distributions and availabilities of traditional prey communities. Some historical feeding areas of Gray Whales have declined in size, but it is possible that new prey communities will become established in other areas where oceanic and ice conditions are favorable. Gray Whales are responding by foraging over broader areas and staying longer in their summer feeding areas to obtain sufficient food and energy stores for winter migration and breeding. Flexibility in feeding modes and prey selection of the Gray Whale has allowed it to survive over many Pleistocene glacial and interglacial periods in the geologic past. Its abilities to use alternative prey and feeding areas are advantages for dealing with climate-driven oceanographic changes. Although switching prey has the advantage of providing additional feeding options, it may also create competition with other marine species that exploit the same resources.","Male and female Gray Whales reached sexual maturity at 6-12 years of age. Mating and birthing are strongly seasonal and synchronized with the migratory cycle. Mating occurs during the middle of the fall southward migration and continues in January-February on the winter breeding range. Gray Whales are thought to have a “promiscuous” mating system in which females and males copulate with multiple partners. Individuals may mate in pairs and in groups of up to 20 or more whales. Mating groups are physically active and fluid, with individuals joining and leaving. Sometimes there are high-speed chases interrupted by mating bouts that last from a few minutes to hours. Males may attempt to mate with females that have newborn young, but females with young usually reject breeding males. Little overt competition has been observed among males, and multiple inseminations likely occur. Thus,it is thought that sperm competition operates in the Gray Whale instead of physical aggression to increase chances of an individual male’s fathering a young. Females invest heavily in rearing a limited number of offspring during their lifetimes, whereas males maximize their reproductive success by mating with as many females as possible. Gestation is 11-13 months, with females normally bearing one offspring at intervals of two years, but longer intervals may occur. Births occur from late December to early March, with the median in late January, when near-term females are in or near breeding grounds or migrating southward. Young are weaned and separate from their mothers at c.7-9 months of age during spring migration or on summer feeding grounds. Gray Whales are physically mature at c.40 years. The longevity record is one female killed in the 1960s who had lived as long as 80 years.","Gray Whales migrate continuously day and night at 6-7 km/h, pausing only to catnap, forage, or mate. On average, swimming Gray Whales will surface every b—7 minutes between long dives and take 3-5 breaths at 15-30second intervals before submerging to resume swimming. Before beginning a long dive and after a sequence of breaths, tail flukes are frequently raised above the water’s surface. Aerial behaviors include “breaching” (jumping out of the water), “spy hopping” (raising head vertically out of the water), “tail stands” (holding flukes and tailstock vertically above water’s surface), and “lobtailing” (slapping water’s surface with flukes). Gray Whales forage continuously on their Arctic feeding grounds during long periods of daylight characteristic of these high-latitude areas in summer. During the winter breeding season, courting Gray Whales are continuously active, rarely resting at the water’s surface. In contrast, females that are nursing newborns move about breeding lagoons with their offspring and frequently rest or “sleep” at the surface while their offspring continue to swim around them and nurse. Young appear to be active at all times, never resting or sleeping.",,"CITES Appendix I. Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. The population in the western North Pacific Ocean is classified as Critically Endangered. The eastern population of the Gray Whale ranges from the Arctic Ocean and Bering Sea feeding grounds south along the western coast of North America to their winter aggregation and breeding areas along the Pacific coast of Baja California, the Gulf of California, and parts of the mainland coast of Mexico, numbering ¢.21,000 individuals in 2009. The western population is only ¢.120-130 individuals and feeds along the northern shores of the Sea of Okhotsk, off Sakhalin Island, and the eastern coast of Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia; their breeding areas are not certain but are believed to be off south-eastern China. Recent genetic and photographic identification studies indicate that the western and eastern populations of Gray Whales share a summer feeding ground in the western Bering Sea along the Kamchatka coast, and that some western Gray Whales migrate eastward across the Bering Sea and North Pacific in fall to join the southward migration of eastern Gray Whales and overwinter in the coastal breeding lagoons of Baja California. It is not known to what extent, if any, these two populations interbreed, and this is an active area of research. Hunting throughout their distribution reduced numbers of Gray Whales to critically low levels by the 1930s, and it received international protection from commercial whaling under the 1946 International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling. Two US statutes, the 1972 Marine Mammal Protection Act and the 1973 Endangered Species Act, provide protection within US waters. In 1994, the US Department of the Interior removed the eastern North Pacific population from the Endangered Species Act’s List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants. In 1972, Mexico protected Laguna Ojo de Liebre (Scammon’s Lagoon), and in 1979, Laguna San Ignacio became a Whale Refuge and Maritime Attraction Zone. In 1980, Mexico extended reserve status to Laguna Manuela and Laguna Guerrero Negro. All of these lagoons lie within the El Vizcaino Biosphere Reserve, created in 1988. In 1993, the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization designated Ojo de Liebre and San Ignacio lagoons as World Heritage Sites, and they are also Ramsar-protected wetlands under the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance. In 2002, all Mexican territorial seas and Economic Exclusion Zones were declared a refuge to protect large whales. Gray Whales also receive varying degrees of protection in territorial waters of Canada, Russia, Japan, Korea, and China. Threats that persist throughout the distribution of the Gray Whale include entanglement in fishing gear, collisions with ships, habitat loss from oil and gas exploration, and general disturbance from coastal development.",Alter et al.

Fresh andsaltwaterfish dominate diets, but insects are also eaten, sometimes copiously. In adequate conditions, it is quite a spectacle to watch small groups of Greater Bulldog Bats raking the water surface with their claws over and over. One study showed that as much as 80% of the diet can be insects. Other prey included shrimp, crabs, and scorpions. Greater Bulldog Bats have large cheek pouches that they use to store partially chewed prey; they forage until cheek pouches are full and then finely chew and swallow prey items. When foraging over water, they use three forms offishing: high search flight, low search flight, and random rake. In high search flight, they emit long (13-3-17 milliseconds) pulses and fly 20-50 cm above the water surface, point-dipping their hindclaws when a food item is detected. In low search flight, they emit shorter pulses (c.5:6 milliseconds) and fly only 2-4 cm above the water and also point-dip their hindclaws when prey is detected. During random rake, they echolocate as during high search flight but dip their hindclaws in the water for up to 10 m . Random rake is mostly used in the presence of copious jumping fish, and they can catch a fish every 50-200 passes.","Female Greater Bulldog Bats have a single embryo per pregnancy. One to two seasonal peaks in births occur, depending on the area. Often the first birth peak coincides with the onset of the rainy season, varying geographically from April to June, and the second peak, usually smaller than the first, occurs toward the end of the rainy season. Nevertheless, pregnant and lactating females and males with scrotal testes have been reported in every month of the year, but individual females have a single pregnancy per year. Although data are limited, gestation seemsto last c.5 months. Testes of males grow and produce sperm seasonally. Males have two ancillary skin sacks in the genital area that might have hormonal or glandular function.","Greater Bulldog Bats are nocturnal, generally leaving the roost within two hours after sunset. In Puerto Rico between November and January, they left the roost within an hour after sunset, but in August, they left an hour later with no apparent reason for the change. Most activity occurs before midnight. On cold nights with temperatures below 12°C, they did not leave the roost. Groups of bats seem to leave the roost together but do not return together. When female members of the same group left the roost, they lingered in its vicinity until other members of the group exited the roost, and then they all flew together toward foraging areas, within 5 m of each other.",,"Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List.

Lesser Bulldog Bats usually roost in hollow trees but can also be found in buildings. They often share roosts with other species of bats such as mastiff bats ( Molossus sp. ). In the Beni Department of Bolivia , Lesser Bulldog Bats commute among forest islands across tropical grasslands and use hollow trees of at least eleven species; roosting trees have greater diameters than non-roosting trees.","Diet of the Lesser Bulldog Bat is strongly dominated by insects, primarily hemipterans, beetles, moths, homopterans, and dipterans. According to all published studies, Lesser Bulldog Bats feed copiously on insects, but other studies also show that they eatfruits of species of Moraceae ( Ficus , Brosimum , and Morus ) and Urticaceae ( Cecropia ) and occasionally fish. Pollen of various tree species has also been reported in stomach contents or fecal pellets. Given that they often fly in open areas, they are believed to be good seed dispersers. One study found many remains of dytiscid beetles, a primarily aquatic species, in the diet, and a pimelodid catfish swallowed a Lesser Bulldog Bat, both suggesting association with aquatic environments. Lesser Bulldog Bats have been observed scooping insect prey from the water surface. Observations in the wild show that they fly in open areas including along slow-flowing streams and rivers, lakes, and estuaries, briefly dipping or dragging their feet or interfemoral membrane in the water to scoop up insects. They spend an average of ¢.120 minutes outside of the roost, most of that time foraging.","Reproductive habits of the Lesser Bulldog Bat indicate a monoestrous cycle, with mating in November—-March and young born in April-May in Panama . In other regions, the cycle varies accordingly. Littersize is one, although one instance of twinning was documented. Reproductive accessory glands, including prostate, are very similar in the Lesser Bulldog Bat and other bats in the families Emballonuridae , Phyllostomidae , and Molossidae . Captive juvenile Lesser Bulldog Bats did not fly until 5-6 weeks old and nursed until ¢.3 months old. Lactating females suckled only their young, which they appeared to recognize from acoustic cues emitted by their young. Mother and young call in coordinated duets in the roost and while flying and foraging together. Males have two ancillary skin sacks in the genital area that might have hormonal or glandular function.","Lesser Bulldog Bats leave their roost quite early, right after sunset, in contrast with their larger congener, the Greater Bulldog Bat that leaves the roost up to two hours after sunset.
