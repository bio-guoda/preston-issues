So I `get`ed it manually using `preston get --remote file:///home/afritter/obs1/data/ hash://sha256/50ce487cc7b6fa90eaa3b6c9ad36a061fbb8ed9f17f3e7746e0b007788888e07`, then re-ran the `origins` command above:\r\n\r\n```\r\n~/obs2$ preston origins --remote file:///home/afritter/obs1/data/ hash://sha256/9069e77fee97fea5bc35f14e67067e1c74f1768b929f326693504a415264e5e7\r\n<hash://sha256/9069e77fee97fea5bc35f14e67067e1c74f1768b929f326693504a415264e5e7> <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#wasDerivedFrom> <hash://sha256/391e7ab9eee166b5b2706cf7150e60cedcd845874c74e8d9346406e04627ba35> .\r\n<hash://sha256/9069e77fee97fea5bc35f14e67067e1c74f1768b929f326693504a415264e5e7> <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#wasDerivedFrom> <hash://sha256/50ce487cc7b6fa90eaa3b6c9ad36a061fbb8ed9f17f3e7746e0b007788888e07> .\r\n<hash://sha256/391e7ab9eee166b5b2706cf7150e60cedcd845874c74e8d9346406e04627ba35> <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#wasDerivedFrom> <hash://sha256/643169a57564565358e366f9165af197410c8f9557619041d77f842f622644f0> .\r\n<hash://sha256/50ce487cc7b6fa90eaa3b6c9ad36a061fbb8ed9f17f3e7746e0b007788888e07> <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#wasDerivedFrom> <hash://sha256/3bc52d81e1775fe779cacd3223849464bde372fd18dd28c0cb3d102b7c1850a7> .\r\n[file:///home/afritter/ob...8dd28c0cb3d102b7c1850a7] 2.1% of 3 kB at 0.01 MB/s completed in < 1 minute\r\n```\r\n\r\nNice! Now it shows `hash://sha256/3bc52d81e1775fe779cacd3223849464bde372fd18dd28c0cb3d102b7c1850a7`. But it doesn't connect it to the root \"biodiversity dataset graph\" UUID, so I manually did another `get` for that `...a7` hash, and re-ran the origins command:\r\n\r\n```\r\n~/obs2$ preston origins --remote file:///home/afritter/obs1/data/ hash://sha256/9069e77fee97fea5bc35f14e67067e1c74f1768b929f326693504a415264e5e7\r\n<hash://sha256/9069e77fee97fea5bc35f14e67067e1c74f1768b929f326693504a415264e5e7> <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#wasDerivedFrom> <hash://sha256/391e7ab9eee166b5b2706cf7150e60cedcd845874c74e8d9346406e04627ba35> .\r\n<hash://sha256/9069e77fee97fea5bc35f14e67067e1c74f1768b929f326693504a415264e5e7> <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#wasDerivedFrom> <hash://sha256/50ce487cc7b6fa90eaa3b6c9ad36a061fbb8ed9f17f3e7746e0b007788888e07> .\r\n<hash://sha256/391e7ab9eee166b5b2706cf7150e60cedcd845874c74e8d9346406e04627ba35> <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#wasDerivedFrom> <hash://sha256/643169a57564565358e366f9165af197410c8f9557619041d77f842f622644f0> .\r\n<hash://sha256/50ce487cc7b6fa90eaa3b6c9ad36a061fbb8ed9f17f3e7746e0b007788888e07> <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#wasDerivedFrom> <hash://sha256/3bc52d81e1775fe779cacd3223849464bde372fd18dd28c0cb3d102b7c1850a7> .\r\n<urn:uuid:0659a54f-b713-4f86-a917-5be166a14110> <http://purl.org/pav/hasVersion> <hash://sha256/3bc52d81e1775fe779cacd3223849464bde372fd18dd28c0cb3d102b7c1850a7> .\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd voila, it's there! So, it seems to me that `origins` isn't caching and therefore not parsing remote content.\r\n\r\nAlso, I expected both prov branches to be connected back to the root UUID, but only the last one is. Happy to fix this, but I didn't want to make commits in case you're @jhpoelen still actively working on these features.","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/comments/1095448930/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/comments/1095528135","html_url":"https://github.com/bio-guoda/preston/issues/8#issuecomment-1095528135","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/8","id":1095528135,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCMmefs5BTG7H","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-11T20:22:01Z","updated_at":"2022-04-11T20:22:01Z","body":"@mielliott thanks for sharing your notes!
