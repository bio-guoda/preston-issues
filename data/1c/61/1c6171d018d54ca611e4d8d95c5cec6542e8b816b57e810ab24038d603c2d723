At a minimum, only `<activity> <type> <Activity>` needs to be said, and when a source activity exists, we should include `<newActivity> <wasInformedBy> <sourceActivity>`. Should we also include `startedAtTime` and `endedAtTime` statements? I can understand their use for debugging and things, but they don't seem useful all the time, especially for activities that operate on fixed data (referenced by hash). Also, do you know of any other types of statements we should emit?\r\n\r\nShould registry readers log an activity even when parsing produces no results? Again, useful for debugging, maybe, but not much value otherwise.","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/comments/603529452/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/comments/603530373","html_url":"https://github.com/bio-guoda/preston/issues/33#issuecomment-603530373","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/33","id":603530373,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwMzUzMDM3Mw==","user":{"login":"mielliott","id":9602463,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MDI0NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9602463?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mielliott","html_url":"https://github.com/mielliott","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mielliott/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mielliott/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mielliott/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mielliott/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mielliott/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mielliott/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mielliott/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mielliott/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mielliott/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-24T22:08:14Z","updated_at":"2020-03-24T22:08:44Z","body":"To clarify, logging the start/end times for things like download events is great.
