I created a jekyll site based on automatically tracked content from iDigBio, added the content to https://github.com/jhpoelen/bees and hosted via Github pages at https://jhpoelen.nl/bees . With this, you can access iDigBio records, metadata and linked images offline, or host it yourself. You should be able to build your own site with the instructions on https://jhpoelen.nl/bees . Can you try? \r\n\r\nNote that the site itself is self-replicating: you can \"clone\" the hosted data using preston, then generate another jekyll site etc. Also, you can update the data, by re-running the ```preston track ...``` command to pull in more records and update existing records.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the site at https://jhpoelen.nl/bees is generated from the data itself. And the data is location agnostic. We can use the same approach to publish / archive / distribute Parasite Tracker content indexed via iDigBio . . . as a way to keep track of what is available. \r\n\r\nCurious to hear your thoughts! \r\n\r\nps - the web ui is auto-generated and using the jekyll / liquid templates. The generated pages are generated from structured data and the look 'n feel can be adopted to your own project.  \r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/comments/693099200/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/comments/700282707","html_url":"https://github.com/bio-guoda/preston/issues/75#issuecomment-700282707","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/75","id":700282707,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwMDI4MjcwNw==","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-28T21:09:33Z","updated_at":"2020-09-28T21:09:33Z","body":"Prototype was reviewed in person with @seltmann @mjy @qgroom @mielliott and others.\r\n\r\nThis prototype resulted in another use case: build image corpus for Herbarium Martii label detection algorithm see #80 and https://github.com/bio-guoda/preston/issues/80 .","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/comments/700282707/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
