And, if I'd like to discuss particular source data with the institution, I prefer using (and citing!) the original, unaltered, data that was shared by that institution. \r\n\r\n> Are these merely a by-product of DwC-A files, a technological response to poor performance when paging through large XML documents? \r\n\r\nI am sure there are many reasons (e.g., technical, social) why DwC-A and their usage turned out the way it did.  But perhaps I am not understanding your question. Please elaborate if you feel I didn't address your question.\r\n\r\n> Are datasets for primary specimen data adding value or are they merely artificial, convenient wrappers?\r\n\r\nFrom where I am standing, datasets (in this case DwC-A) are the unit of publication for specimen data records. An analogy might be that an institution publishes a \"phonebook\" volume of their specimen data at some interval (weekly, monthly, yearly). Individual entries in this phonebook can be referenced as long as the reference to that phonebook is well-defined and unaltered copies can be accessed. \r\n\r\n> there are of course very good reasons to keep track of primary specimen data – at the level of the specimen. Are there comparable reasons to keep track of primary specimen datasets as a whole – a composite of specimen data – served from those same collections/museums/institutions? \r\n\r\nI can reliably reference a DwC-A version published by an institution. I see no technical limitation to publish records on a specimen level (e.g., a dataset with a single record), but I am noticing that the current practice is to publish many records at once. With this, if I'd like to keep track of primary specimen data on the specimen level, I need to keep track of the datasets in which they live.\r\n\r\n>What if we lost interest in DwC-A files for whatever reason (eg frictionless data) and began serving specimen datasets through other structures?\r\n\r\nIf we lost interest in DwC-A, then I imagine that specimen data will be tracked via alternate data formats while keeping their DwC-A ancestors around. This is why dataset tracking method should be content agnostic, just like ```git``` is agnostic to what content is being tracked. Preston offers such a method.\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/comments/600200115/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/comments/601363157","html_url":"https://github.com/bio-guoda/preston/issues/49#issuecomment-601363157","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/49","id":601363157,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwMTM2MzE1Nw==","user":{"login":"dshorthouse","id":326459,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjQ1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/326459?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dshorthouse","html_url":"https://github.com/dshorthouse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dshorthouse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dshorthouse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dshorthouse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dshorthouse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dshorthouse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dshorthouse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dshorthouse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dshorthouse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dshorthouse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-19T19:06:55Z","updated_at":"2020-03-19T19:06:55Z","body":"How do you mean `git` is agnostic to what content is being tracked?

Similarly, the decision of which dataset to use is up to the consumer of that data. It so happens to be that our Preston observatories keep track of biodiversity dataset registries like GBIF and iDigBio by taking inventories every month or so. And, by doing this, we've shown that these registered datasets are published using widely varying strategies. The main point, however, is to establish a method to reliably reference datasets and the context (e.g., data network) they were found in. \r\n\r\nCurious to hear any remaining thoughts, questions or comments.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/comments/601479667/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/comments/1231915577","html_url":"https://github.com/bio-guoda/preston/issues/49#issuecomment-1231915577","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/49","id":1231915577,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCMmefs5JbYo5","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-30T16:46:35Z","updated_at":"2022-08-30T16:46:35Z","body":"@dshorthouse @qgroom here's an example of why we should keep track of primary specimen data:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/jhpoelen/specimen-image-index\r\n\r\nand associated discussions\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/jhpoelen/specimen-image-index/issues/1\r\nhttps://github.com/bio-guoda/preston/issues/168\r\n\r\nand associated data publication:\r\n\r\nPoelen, Jorrit H., & Groom, Quentin.

I'd like to see some mechanism to assess  how `identifiedBy`, `dateIdentified`, and `scientificName` are being used.

So, here are two scenarios that always struck me as problems in either data integrity or communications of intent:\r\n\r\n- For any/all dataset that _does not_ have an identification history extension but whose records are specimens, what proportion show evidence that `dateIdentified` has changed as a function of preston snapshots whereas the other two terms have not? (i.e. is this a re-verification by the determiner?)\r\n\r\n- For any/all dataset that _does not_ have an identification history extension but whose records are specimens, what proportion show evidence that `scientificName` has changed as a function of preston snapshots whereas the other two terms have not? (umm...say what? Did a data manager \"update the name\" from some authoritative source, potentially misrepresenting the intent of the determiner?)\r\n\r\nI suppose other combinations of these three terms through many snapshots could be revealing. Do botanists have different practices than do entomologists? What proportion of specimen-based records across all snapshots has had `scientificName` changed at least once? Are these nomenclatural or taxonomic changes? The unfortunate part of this is the general lack of content in these three terms, which is itself revealing in how we communicate our specimen-based science.\r\n\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/comments/1236123993/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/comments/1236575220","html_url":"https://github.com/bio-guoda/preston/issues/49#issuecomment-1236575220","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/49","id":1236575220,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCMmefs5JtKP0","user":{"login":"qgroom","id":5530576,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MzA1NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5530576?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qgroom","html_url":"https://github.com/qgroom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qgroom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qgroom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qgroom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qgroom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qgroom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qgroom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qgroom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qgroom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qgroom/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-05T06:10:33Z","updated_at":"2022-09-05T06:10:33Z","body":"@dshorthouse interesting ideas.

And, Plazi is keeping track of what they mobilize (see https://github.com/plazi/treatments-xml ), so that suspicious records can be traced to their origin and analyzed. I've had some great recent experiences with Plazi folks like @flsimoes @myrmoteras and collaborators like @ajacsherman in which the expert Aja found/reported suspicious records and @flsimoes traced their origin and, when possible, applied (versioned) corrections (e.g., https://github.com/jhpoelen/hmw/issues/10 ). \r\n\r\nSo, yes, incorrect and incomplete citations are expected and it takes a village to help review, find, and address these imperfections.
