<p><em>Comments</em>: As we discussed at ASM, GitHub issues could be a good way to bring up new papers or other suggested changes to the MDD. I’ll try this out for this paper and maybe some others I come across. If we like this format, we can set up some issue templates to make it easier to open the issue and standardize the format.</p>
<p>Now on to comments on the paper itself. This paper proposes recognizing the subspecies <em>Eptesicus fuscus miradorensis</em> as a species. I am not convinced, and in my database I plan to keep it as a subspecies for now (I’ll make it a species if MDD decides to accept it). Ramírez-Chaves et al. (2023) use only mtDNA (Cytb and COI). <em>E. f. miradorensis</em> is sister to all of <em>E. fuscus</em> in the Cytb tree, but sister to just <em>E. f. pallidus</em> (western USA) in the COI tree. Yi &amp; Latch (2022) also studied nuclear DNA and found a complex pattern of isolation and gene flow, but no especially distinctive position for <em>E. f. miradorensis</em>. Possibly more of the subspecies should be recognized as species, but to me the evidence looks more like a single species with a complex pattern of regional divergence. From <span class="citation" data-cites="jhpoelen">@jhpoelen</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jekyll (and other page generators) plugins (or custom scripts) can be used to generate a single page per species if desired. Jekyll slang for this functionality is “generators” (see https://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/generators/) . However, as I mentioned earlier, this customization is not supported via Github pages, so would introduce some friction in the maintenance/deploy process.</li>
<li>You can combine the single page with dynamics (css/javascript) to render images or additional information when taxa are selected, or hide rows that do not fit some search criteria.</li>
<li>Single per-species pages are not absolutely necessary (e.g., instead links like https://mammaldiversity.org/#1234 ) can be used and dynamics can be introduced get the look ’n feel of a single page (e.g., hide other rows and show more information on selection). However, I can see, conceptually, that per-page species are easier to think about. But, … please note the increased maintenance and deployment friction.</li>
<li>For CSS / javascript techniques to build single page apps - I’d suggest to just search around for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application : it is a well know architectural approach that has a ton of books, libraries etc built around it. Note that https://globalbioticinteractions.org uses the approach also.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, <span class="citation" data-cites="jhpoelen">@jhpoelen</span> just added such an endpoint to the Open Traits Network site, and folks were pretty enthusiastic about it. See https://github.com/open-traits-network/open-traits-network.github.io/issues/109#issuecomment-618127394 .</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="liphardt">@liphardt</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="n8upham">@n8upham</span> in a recent discussion, I promised to share some links to software/web development resources .</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>continuous integration/unit testing - to help avoid bugs and drive modular design, I write unit tests and run them automatically in travis-ci.org every time I change any code or periodically. Most languages have unit testing framework. A test framework in node/javascript I use is Tape https://www.npmjs.com/package/tape . The neat thing is that Tape can also help test code that runs in a browser. For a more general background in unit testing and test driven development, please refer to standard text https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/387190.Test_Driven_Development .</p></li>
<li><p>re-use existing libraries via package managers - to re-use existing libraries, package managers can be used to easily import and leverage code. Most languages have package managers. For node/javascript npm is a popular one. For client-side (in browser) javascript, I’d highly recommend using a package manager in combination with something like browserify https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browserify or similar to help package your javascript modules for use in a browser.</p></li>
<li><p>keep it simple - you’ll find that there’s intimidating amount of (javascript) libraries / frameworks that help to make things “easier”. Similarly, there’s many very cool nosql databases, webservices, compile-to-javascript languages (e.g., coffeescript, typescript), infrastructures, platform-as-a service stuff out there that (cl)aim to make your life easier. However, I’d argue that most web application can do very well with static (optionally data driven/generated via Jekyll or Hugo) webpages with plain old css, html, javascript using standard web browser apis. I find the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) documentation to be useful to learn more about the powerful capacities built into the browsers we use every day. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/ .</p></li>

<p>Hope this helps and curious to hear comments. The separate explore page and javascript function for filtering. Landing page changed to add link to download database. <span class="citation" data-cites="liphardt">@liphardt</span> I broke this upon uploading a new mdd.csv file – I thought because ‘ID_number’ was changed to ‘id’ (we want to keep the latter), but my simple fix on the explore.md page did not do the trick. I looked elsewhere in the code, but didn’t see reference to this column – perhaps you know where to look?</p>
<p>Thanks (and sorry!) added searching and new page creation to explore page</p>
<p>Create a “Higher Taxa” page for Order–&gt;Family–&gt;Genus with the counts/info for that to be created dynamically. This to avoid e.g., issue of search “Sus” looking for boar but retrieving the endings of many other names. On the taxa page (https://mammaldiversity.github.io/taxa.html), make the column be “Living species” and then an adjacent column for “Extinct species (last 500 yrs)” — this would involve parsing the current “extinct?” column (now “extinct”) and summarizing that information</p>
<p>Also then on the per-species permalink pages, add the fields for <code>extinct    domestic    flagged newSppSinceMSW3</code></p>
<p>For now as 0/1 data but we could imagine forming a sentence from this, e.g., “This species is (living / extinct in the last 500 years), they live in (wild / domestic) habitats, their taxonomic status is (accepted / flagged), and they (are newly recognized since / we already recognized in) MSW3 2005.” After we upload the next version (so not yet), use the binary ‘parentheses’ column to code “(authority, year)” vs “authority, year”.</p>
<p>Here’s an explanation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the original name of the species has changed, the format is modified by placing the name of the original authority (and, for an animal name, the year of publication of the name by the original authority) in parentheses. For example, the Philippine brown deer, Rusa marianna, was originally described as Cervus mariannus by Desmarest in 1822. For this reason, this name appears as “Rusa marianna (Desmarest, 1822)” in print. The reason for the use of parentheses is that the genus name now used for this species of Philippine deer is not the same name that Desmarest originally published.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>https://www.aje.com/arc/editing-tip-scientific-names-species/ The idea would be to display a very rough world map with the country highlighted would be an interesting output – possibly via Google tools to make it a zoom-able map Thanks for all your work on a great resource, but I have a suggestion that I think your be useful for many.</p>
<p>At the moment you have the option of exploring the taxonomy from order level, searching the whole database for a species, or accessing a specific item on a species. It would be helpful if the explore taxonomy and search pages could be seeded with values. The way the anchor is parsed for the species-id parameter in the post hash section could be extended to supply other parameters.</p>
<p>A search (or filter) parameter could be used to initialise the “filter” text in the search box. In this way a link with https://www.mammaldiversity.org/explore.html#search=Felis would generate the list of cats in this genus.</p>
<p>The explore taxonomy page could have parameters to expand the orders, families, and genus. So a link with https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxa.html#order=carnivora would open up and display the families in the order. Similarly a link with https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxa.html#family=felidae would open up and display the genera in the cat family. And then https://www.mammaldiversity.org/taxa.html#genus=Felis would open up to show the Felis species.</p>
<p>These options would enable links to verify information about specific taxa. This was possible in the original version and I wrote a Wikipedia template for making such citations. These are now dead links, which doesn’t help encourage people to use this database for citations, something I’ve being trying to promote.</p>
<p>I think these suggestions should be quite easy to implement from what I see in the code. I did make a fork to try and do this but I found the Github infrastructure too confusing. I think that the suggestions would be helpful for users and also help promotion of the use of the database by allowing exact citations for the taxonomy rather than just species entities.</p>

<p>So far I have gone over Afrosoricida (just one issue) and Artiodactyla (a lot). My plan is to go over the orders in alphabetical order and send you the results, but let me know if a different format would work better for you. After this is done, we can work on matching up synonyms, which will be easier once the classifications are more aligned. Key:</p>
<p>Straightforward changes listed at the beginning of each order +: I accept the MDD’s classification (but there is perhaps room for further discussion) -: I choose to maintain my classification for now -!: Same, but I recommend that MDD change its classification AI: Action item</p>
<p>Afrosoricida</p>
<p>Chrysochloridae</p>
<p>Chrysospalax villosa vs. villosus (-)</p>
<p>MDD has villosus, I have villosa.</p>
<p>My notes on the name complex say: “From σπάλαξ spalax”mole-rat, spalacid“. LSJ claims the word is feminine, sometimes masculine. The variant ἀσπάλαξ aspalax is masculine. In practice, -spalax names are treated as masculine.” (e.g. Spalax graecus)</p>
<p>Gill’s original description of the name talks about “C. villosa”, but the C. stands for Chrysochloris, not Chrysospalax, as Gill named the taxon as a “section” of Chrysochloris.</p>
<p>AI: Confirm this specific epithet change; I think there’s room for disagreement.</p>
<p>Artiodactyla</p>
<p>Straightforward accepted changes:</p>
<p>New mergers Alcelaphus caama and A. lichtensteinii -&gt; A. buselaphus Capricornis milneedwardsii and C. thar -&gt; C. sumatraensis Damaliscus korrigum and D. superstes -&gt; D. lunatus Kobus anselli -&gt; K. leche Minor: MDD doesn’t cite a source for synonymizing this species; it merely states that the Groves &amp; Grubb taxonomy is rejected. It should probably cite: Jeffery, R. and Nefdt, R. 2013. Kobus leche southern lechwe. In: J. S. Kingdon and M. Hoffmann (eds), The Mammals of Africa, Bloomsbury, London, UK, pp. 449-453. Alces americanus -&gt; A. alces Delphinus capensis -&gt; D. delphis Tursiops australis -&gt; T. aduncus Tursiops gephyreus -&gt; T. truncatus New splits Cephalophus rubidus &lt; C. nigrifrons Eudorcas albonotatus and E. tilonura &lt; E. rufifrons Madoqua cavendishi, M. damarensis, M. hindei, M. thomasi &lt; M. kirkii Minor: your reference to Brotherton (2013) is missing page numbers (should be pp. 327-333). Cervus hanglu &lt; C. elaphus Inia humboldtiana &lt; I. geoffrensis New species Mesoplodon eueu Spelling fixes Mazama gouazoupira -&gt; M. gouazoubira (I missed an ICZN decision) Recently extinct species omitted from my database export Lipotes vexillifer Other changes Mazama jucunda is a senior synonym of M. bororo Casatia, a fossil, was mistakenly marked as extant in Hesperomys Babyrousa bolabatuensis, a subfossil, was mistakenly marked as extant in Hesperomys Bovidae</p>
<p>Bos domesticus and banteng (-)</p>
<p>MDD recognizes domesticus as a separate species for the domestic banteng. Possibly more consistent, but this species isn’t generally recognized in my experience. Gentry et al. (2004) do not discuss the banteng.</p>
<p>MDD attributes the name domesticus to Wilckens, 1905. I instead have Bos banteng domesticus Duerst, 1905, as a nomen nudum. This book is here: <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.google.com/books/edition/Grundz**Age_der_Naturgeschichte_der_Haust/JWDZAAAAMAAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=Grundz**Age*der*Naturgeschichte*der*Haustiere&amp;printsec=frontcover__;w7zDvCsrKys!!IKRxdwAv5BmarQ!cLXDaRAItaTOANRJzRz_YE9pQXioZyndrNBdaEu9-yihkxb3LUwjGsGb76I49P4_x_i6bGdeE7aTL4D96K3lysbWWrQ$">https://www.google.com/books/edition/Grundz%C3%BCge_der_Naturgeschichte_der_Haust/JWDZAAAAMAAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=Grundz%C3%BCge+der+Naturgeschichte+der+Haustiere&amp;printsec=frontcover</a></p>
<p>The book is a reworking by Duerst of a previous book by Wilckens, who was dead by the time it was published. In the foreword, Duerst explicitly says that he completely redid the section on cattle (p. iv). So I think the name should indeed be attributed to Duerst, not Wilckens. Whether or not domesticus Duerst is a nomen nudum is more debatable. The citation on p. 245 is very barebones (“Bos Banteng domesticus, das zahme Bantengrind”), but there is some more discussion of bantengs on pp. 239-242. However, I don’t see any characters cited that are supposed to distinguish domesticated from wild bantengs.</p>
<p>MDD says domesticus is preoccupied but there is no other alternative name. According to my notes the name seleniceros Heller, 1890, may have been based on a domestic banteng; it came from Timor where wild bantengs do not occur. Unfortunately I haven’t been able to locate the original description. I did dig up the original description of seligniceros Meyer, 1879 (not 1878), a nomen nudum also based on a specimen from Timor (perhaps the same one?).</p>
<p>AI:</p>
<p>Figure out nomenclature for domesticus. Confirm whether seleniceros is available for the domestic banteng. In Hesp, consider recognizing domestic bantengs at the subspecies level at least. Bos indicus, B. primigenius, B. taurus (-)</p>
<p>B. primigenius was omitted from the list I sent only because it is extinct. I recognize it as valid.</p>
<p>MDD recognizes Bos indicus and Bos taurus as separate domestic species, based on Gentry et al. (2004). I have them as subspecies of Bos taurus.</p>
<p>This is mostly a philosophical disagreement, and I don’t think there’s been much discussion in the literature. I currently recognize the wild ancestors of the zebu and taurine cattle as the same species, Bos primigenius, so I think it makes sense to recognize a single domestic species. It’s true that there are two independent domestications, but that appears to be true for several other domestic species too (e.g. pigs) and splitting them up isn’t practical.</p>
<p>AI: Come to an agreement on how to handle this case.</p>
<p>Budorcas tibetana (+)</p>
<p>New split in MDD. I hadn’t seen the main cited source and I’ll accept the split.</p>
<p>MDD also cites Groves &amp; Grubb’s Ungulate Taxonomy but generally rejects their taxonomy. I have done the same thing because I felt they needed some incubation to know if they’d be accepted. Indeed, in this case G&amp;G recognize four takin species, but we ended up with only two.</p>
<p>Nomenclature: I had the specific epithet as tibetanus, but I misread a dictionary entry and the Greek word δορκάς is actually feminine. The spelling tibetana is correct.</p>
<p>Capra caucasica vs. cylindricornis (-)</p>
<p>MDD recognizes Capra cylindricornis as a separate species, I have it as a subspecies.</p>
<p>I hadn’t seen the cited source (Weinberg et al., 2010). However, it actually suggests naming the two species cylindricornis and severtzovi, because caucasica is supposedly based on a hybrid. They also don’t even sound very convinced that there are really two species. Given this uncertainty and the absence of genetic evidence, I would prefer to stick to one species.</p>
<p>Minor: MDD has a typo in the journal name (should be Galemys, not Galemy). The original spelling of severtzovi is severtzowi; I’ll list severtzovi as an incorrect subsequent spelling for now.</p>
<p>Cephalophus vs. Cephalophorus and Cephalophula (-)</p>
<p>MDD recognizes Cephalophorus (and Cephalophula) as a separate genus; I don’t.</p>
<p>The cited source (Bärmann et al., 2022) is a mtDNA-only study that doesn’t fully resolve the relationships among cephalophines, but Cephalophus is recovered as possibly paraphyletic relative to Sylvicapra. This seems a little marginal and I’m going to skip the generic rearrangement for now.</p>
<p>They also name Leucocephalophus as a new genus, with just barely enough to move it beyond being a nomen nudum. I will make it a subgenus for now.</p>
<p>Cephalophus kivuensis (-)</p>
<p>MDD recognizes C. kivuensis as a separate species from “C. nigrifrons”; I don’t.</p>
<p>This is based on the same source. Their mtDNA tree (fig. 3) shows pretty much every other species in the group to be nonmonophyletic, suggesting that either mtDNA isn’t good at sorting out species here or a much more thorough reclassification is in order. They don’t specify where their samples of nigrifrons come from. There are various other available synonyms of nigrifrons from the eastern part of its distribution (e.g. emini). I would reject the change and wait for something more comprehensive.</p>
<p>Cephalophus silvicultor vs. silvicultrix (-)</p>
<p>MDD has the epithet as silvicultor, I have silvicultrix.</p>
<p>The original spelling (which I have seen) is silvicultrix. It was combined with the feminine name Antilope, but now it is in masculine Cephalophus.</p>
<p>This is a Latin noun meaning “female forest cultivator”. The masculine form would be silvicultor, but since the word is a noun, not an adjective, it does not change form based on the gender of the genus.</p>
<p>AI: Confirm this and publish it.</p>
<p>Eudorcas rufina (-)</p>
<p>MDD lumps rufinus/rufina within rufifrons while I have it as valid.</p>
<p>MDD cites Mammals of Africa p. 357 for lumping the two. But the account there sounds more like the author is discussing a related extinct species in the account of another one, not that they are necessarily synonymizing them. The name isn’t listed as an explicit synonym or subspecies, and its range is not included in the range map for rufifrons. I would like to see more evidence before changing the classification.</p>
<p>Nomenclature: as with Budorcas, Eudorcas is feminine, so the -us names in my database are wrong and I will fix them.</p>
<p>Gazella arabica and erlangeri (+)</p>
<p>MDD reorganizes these species (enlarging arabica to include erlangeri and various subspecies of gazella), based on Bärmann et al. (2013), which I missed.</p>
<p>There is a discrepancy in the name of the form darehshourii, which MDD and Bärmann spell dareshurii. I did some digging but can’t quite confirm which spelling is right:</p>
<p>The original description is at <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://jsciences.ut.ac.ir/article_31396.html__;!!IKRxdwAv5BmarQ!cLXDaRAItaTOANRJzRz_YE9pQXioZyndrNBdaEu9-yihkxb3LUwjGsGb76I49P4_x_i6bGdeE7aTL4D96K3lou29Gkk$">https://jsciences.ut.ac.ir/article_31396.html</a> but the PDF link is broken An archive of Groves’s old website is at <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://web.archive.org/web/20130514055726/http:/*arts.anu.edu.au/grovco/Bovids.htm__;Lw!!IKRxdwAv5BmarQ!cLXDaRAItaTOANRJzRz_YE9pQXioZyndrNBdaEu9-yihkxb3LUwjGsGb76I49P4_x_i6bGdeE7aTL4D96K3lOH67Kws$">https://web.archive.org/web/20130514055726/http://arts.anu.edu.au/grovco/Bovids.htm</a> but the link to this paper is broken (it goes to his Gazella bennettii paper instead).

Ref: Karami, M., Hemami, M.R. and Groves, C.P. 2002. Taxonomic, distributional and ecological date on gazelles in Iran. Zoology in the Middle East 26:29-36. Chiozzi et al. (2021) list the original description as being darehshourii, but cite Karami et al. (2002) as the first to use dareshurii. Ref: Chiozzi, G., De Marchi, G., Fasola, M., Ibrahim, K.M., Bardelli, G., Hagos, F., Rocca, F. and Masseti, M. 2021. Insular gazelles of the circum-Arabian seas: origin, distribution, dwarfism and taxonomy. Mammalian Biology 102(1):1-20. doi:10.1007/s42991-021-00186-3 Based on the above I think most likely the original spelling was darehshourii and Groves/the Iranians started changing it in 2002 (maybe Dareshuri let his preference about the spelling of his surname be known?). But that’s pure speculation until we have the original description. Either way, there’s enough of a disagreement here that we should publish a discussion of the spelling of this form.</p>
<p>AI: Confirm spelling of dareshurii.</p>
<p>Nanger notata/us and N. petersii (+)</p>
<p>Two species split from N. granti; another similar situation and I will accept the split.</p>
<p>Spelling: MDD has Nanger notatus, I have the epithet as notata. I looked up the original description of Nanger by Lataste (1885) and can confirm the name is masculine, so notatus is right. Lorenzen et al. (2008) also use notata though.</p>
<p>Ovis (+)</p>
<p>MDD has Ovis gmelini and O. vignei as separate species; I lump them into Ovis aries with subspecies aries (domestic), arkal, and cycloceros. This is a big mess. I am going to follow your classification because clearly you have thought about this more, but below are some more notes.</p>
<p>My classification doesn’t make much sense here: I should put the wild and domestic forms in separate species for consistency, and I don’t know how I ended up with cycloceros when there are numerous older names synonymized under it.</p>
<p>MDD’s main cited source is Rezaei et al. (2010). They show good evidence for separate species orientalis (Turkey to Iran and introduced Mediterranean populations) and vignei (Iran to Pakistan and southern Central Asia). MDD rejects the name orientalis as based on a hybrid and uses the name gmelini for this species instead. MDD cites no source for the claim that orientalis is based on a hybrid. There is apparently a lectotype for orientalis in Moscow, so that can provide a way to resolve the question. MDD doesn’t state why the older name musimon Pallas, 1811, isn’t used over gmelini Blyth, 1841. However, the wild sheep of Sardinia are probably an ancient feral populations, so perhaps they should go into aries, just like dingos go into Canis familiaris.</p>
<p>The original spelling of gmelini Blyth, 1841, is actually gmelinii, though the form gmelini seems to be used more often. However, some recent authors also use gmelinii, so I would favor reverting to the original spelling. I wasn’t able to find any sources explicitly discussing this spelling. Its type locality is “Erzeroom” = Erzurum, eastern Turkey. A few sources I read claim that this is erroneous because wild sheep do not occur there, but at least the map in Rezaei et al. (2010) does show the species there.</p>
<p>The name arabica is in Oman, which doesn’t have sheep on the Rezaei et al. map, but I’ll trust you that it should go with vignei. The name erskinei is from somewhere in Iran; I’m putting it in gmelini but this needs confirmation. My database had both isphaganica and isphahanica; I looked up the original descriptions and concluded that isphaganica is the original spelling but isphahanica is a justified emendation by prevailing usage.</p>
<p>AI:</p>
<p>Establish the spelling of gmelini/gmelinii. Establish whether orientalis is available. Taurotragus vs. Tragelaphus (+)</p>
<p>I recognize Taurotragus as distinct from Tragelaphus, MDD doesn’t.</p>
<p>Comments in MDD say that Taurotragus isn’t recognized because the Groves &amp; Grubb classification is generally rejected, but Taurotragus was recognized as a genus in Grubb (2005: p. 696, MSW3). However, Hassanin et al. (2018) show that Tragelaphus is paraphyletic relative to Taurotragus, so I will accept the synonymy.</p>
<p>You don’t recognize the genus Ammelaphus Heller, 1912, but it’s worth noting that Strepsicerastes Knottnerus-Meyer, 1903, appears to be an older name for this group (which is probably worthy of recognition as a subgenus). I haven’t seen the original publication to confirm this though.</p>
<p>AI: Consider publishing the Ammelaphus/Strepsicerastes situation.</p>
<p>Camelidae</p>
<p>Lama vs. Vicugna (-)</p>
<p>I have Vicugna as distinct; MDD lumps it under Lama.</p>
<p>The cited reason is low genetic distance. That’s probably fair, but I feel like a taxonomic database shouldn’t make such a change on its own initiative; it should be proposed in a peer-reviewed paper first.</p>
<p>Cervidae</p>
<p>Elaphurus/Rusa/Rucervus (+)</p>
<p>MDD recognizes Rusa (4 species) and Elaphurus (1 species) as separate genera and puts the species eldii in Rucervus. I have them all as Cervus.</p>
<p>MDD’s cited source is Heckeberg (2020). Her molecular tree is on p. 23. The mtDNA tree aligns well with my classification (all genera are monophyletic), but the nDNA tree is quite different. In either case several of the genera in the MDD are nonmonophyletic.</p>
<p>I can’t remember what I based my generic classification on, and I can’t find a source that uses this classification. I am going to change to your/Heckeberg’s classification so at least I’m not making it up. To resolve Cervini into monophyletic genera we’re probably going to need a bigger nuclear dataset.</p>
<p>Muntiacus muntjak group (+)</p>
<p>Here MDD recognizes three species based on genetic data: M. malabaricus in S India and Sri Lanka, M. vaginalis in most of India and mainland Southeast Asia, and M. muntjak in insular Southeast Asia/Sundaland. I recognize two species based on some of Groves’s work: M. vaginalis in South Asia and M. muntjak in SE Asia, both mainland and islands.</p>
<p>I don’t think my classification is tenable so I’m going to change to the MDD one, but want to highlight that the cited source (Martins et al., 2017) explicitly disclaims any taxonomic changes. A more conservative option would be to recognize all three as a single species, as in MSW 3.</p>
<p>Singh et al. (2021) recently recognized another species in this group, Muntiacus aureus. Should MDD follow suit? Ref: Singh, B., Kumar, A., Uniyal, V.P. and Gupta, S.K. 2021. Phylogeography and population genetic structure of red muntjacs: evidence of enigmatic Himalayan red muntjac from India. BMC Ecology and Evolution 21(1):1-15. doi:10.1186/s12862-021-01780-2</p>
<p>An interesting nomenclatural aspect is that malabaricus was named twice, under the same name, by Wroughton and Lydekker, both in 1915. Both databases attribute the name to Lydekker. The type specimen is said to be BMNH 13.8.22.133 by Lydekker and BMNH 13.8.22.103 by Wroughton but I suspect one of those is a typo and it’s the same specimen; MDD says the type is 13.8.22.103. The BMNH online catalog also has 103: <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://data.nhm.ac.uk/dataset/collection-specimens/resource/05ff2255-c38a-40c9-b657-4ccb55ab2feb/record/3626309__;!!IKRxdwAv5BmarQ!cLXDaRAItaTOANRJzRz_YE9pQXioZyndrNBdaEu9-yihkxb3LUwjGsGb76I49P4_x_i6bGdeE7aTL4D96K3lBD20UAs$">https://data.nhm.ac.uk/dataset/collection-specimens/resource/05ff2255-c38a-40c9-b657-4ccb55ab2feb/record/3626309</a> As for the date, Wroughton’s name was published on 30 September 1915 according to the issue cover (in BHL). Lydekker (1915) doesn’t bear a precise date, but the preface is dated 19 April 1915. I suppose it was published not long after that.</p>
<p>AI: Confirm priority of descriptions for malabaricus</p>
<p>Delphinidae</p>
<p>Globicephala macrorhyncha vs. macrorhynchus (-)</p>
<p>I have this species as macrorhyncha, MDD has macrorhynchus.</p>
<p>This hinges on whether the name is an adjective or a noun in apposition. It sounds like an adjective to me (“long-nosed”), but macrorhynchus is overwhelmingly more common in recent literature, and for names like this sometimes there’s a credible argument that the epithet is a noun.</p>
<p>AI: Figure out whether this has been discussed in the literature. MSW 3 only refers to Van Bree (1971).</p>
<p>Hippopotamidae</p>
<p>Malagasy Hippopotamus (-)</p>
<p>MDD recognizes two species of extinct Malagasy Hippopotamus: H. lemerlei and H. madagascariensis (including H. guldbergi). I instead recognize H. laloumena, H. guldbergi, and H. lemerlei, the latter including H. madagascariensis.</p>
<p>H. laloumena may have been excluded from MDD because it is supposed to be older.</p>
<p>This is a confusing situation but I reviewed it in some detail a few years ago and came to the conclusion that the literature indicates that the holotype of H. madagascariensis is indeed a H. lemerlei. See <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://hesperomys.com/n/22965__;!!IKRxdwAv5BmarQ!cLXDaRAItaTOANRJzRz_YE9pQXioZyndrNBdaEu9-yihkxb3LUwjGsGb76I49P4_x_i6bGdeE7aTL4D96K3lpcsEMJk$">http://hesperomys.com/n/22965</a></p>
<p>AI: Consider publishing this discussion.</p>
<p>Physeteridae</p>
<p>Physeter catodon vs. macrocephalus (+)</p>
<p>MDD calls the sperm whale P. macrocephalus and I use P. catodon.</p>
<p>I reviewed Husson &amp; Holthuis (1974) and the argument for macrocephalus seems solid under the Code; I am making the change. I didn’t do it before because MSW 3 uses catodon, and there hasn’t been any published work (that I have seen) making a reasoned argument for change.</p>
<p>AI: Publish this discussion.</p>
<p>Suidae</p>
<p>Sus domesticus vs. Sus scrofa (-)</p>
<p>This is the domestic pig. MDD recognizes it as a species; I don’t.</p>
<p>MDD is being consistent here, but there is little precedent for recognizing domestic pigs as a separate species, so I’m going to punt on this one.</p>
<p>Sus bucculentus (+)</p>
<p>I recognize this species; MDD lumps it under Sus scrofa.</p>
<p>The main cited source in MDD is Robins et al. (2006). I don’t find that totally convincing, because it is based on mtDNA only and acknowledges that their result may be because of introgression. However, Meijaard &amp; Groves (2013) accepted bucculentus as a synonym of their “Sus moupinensis”, which included pigs from a big chunk of the range of Sus scrofa. If Groves doesn’t even believe in the species any more, that’s enough for me to accept the change. Reference:</p>
<p>Meijaard, E. and Groves, C.P. 2013. New taxonomic proposals for the Sus scrofa group in eastern Asia. Suiform Soundings 12(1):26-30.</p>
<p>Tayassuidae</p>
<p>Catagonus vs. Parachoerus (-!)</p>
<p>MDD places the Chacoan peccary in the genus Catagonus; I use Parachoerus.</p>
<p>This is based on Dutra et al. (2017), a phylogenetic analysis of Tayassuidae. They found that C. wagneri isn’t closely related to the type species of Catagonus, which is a Pleistocene fossil, and accordingly revalidated the genus Parachoerus Rusconi, 1930, for wagneri and another fossil species, Parachoerus carlesi.

<p>Carnivora</p>
<p>Straightforward accepted changes:</p>
<p>New mergers Eupleres major -&gt; E. goudotii Galidictis grandidieri -&gt; G. fasciata Salanoia durrelli -&gt; S. concolor Mustela subpalmata -&gt; M. nivalis Arctophoca -&gt; Arctocephalus Nasuella meridensis -&gt; Nasua olivacea Nasuella -&gt; Nasua New splits Ailurus styani &lt; A. fulgens Nyctereutes viverrinus &lt; N. procyonoides Doesn’t affect the species list but I’m skeptical about the subspecies albus for Hokkaido. It was apparently named twice in 1904 by two different authors (not clear which was first), one said to come from Nagasaki and the other from Hokkaido. Leopardus emiliae &lt; L. tigrinus Bdeogale omnivora &lt; B. crassicauda Proteles septentrionalis &lt; P. cristatus Melogale subaurantiaca &lt; M. moschata Neogale &lt; Mustela Recently extinct species omitted from my database export Dusicyon avus (though I am surprised to learn it went extinct in the last 500 years; found a reference establishing that it did in the IUCN account) Cryptoprocta spelea I don’t think there’s evidence this species lived past 1500 so it might not belong in the MDD, though it is on the Red List. I’m personally also somewhat skeptical it’s really distinct, since it is diagnosed purely on the basis of size. Other changes Leopardus fasciatus is a senior synonym of L. munoai Canidae</p>
<p>Canis lycaon (+)</p>
<p>MDD recognizes this species; I don’t. I have some misgivings about this because the cited source shows that C. lycaon are essentially just C. lupus with some hybrid coyote ancestry, but I’ll accept it.</p>
<p>Lycalopex spelling (-)</p>
<p>I treat Lycalopex as feminine and consequently use the specific epithets grisea, gymnocerca, and vetula. MDD uses names in -us instead.</p>
<p>Lycalopex derives from the Greek ἀλώπηξ alôpêx “fox”, which is feminine (<a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=alwphc&amp;la=greek*lexicon__;Iw!!IKRxdwAv5BmarQ!YErxDnZwmMPqmExfPwBn5vjUPhh_NFoefdoZQV5lcwHHgfJ0OS-V4wy_jEcbLJ4WYR6Xq9FIdjGlbcIcWzUolpza10I$">LSJ</a>).</p>
<p>The specific epithets griseus (“gray”) and vetulus (“elderly”) are definitely adjectives, so they should change with the gender of the genus; gymnocercus (“naked-tailed”) could conceivably be interpreted as a noun in apposition instead to preserve the original form.</p>
<p>AI: Confirm the specific epithet changes are right and publish.</p>
<p>Herpestidae</p>
<p>Galerella vs. Herpestes (-)</p>
<p>MDD synonymizes Galerella under Herpestes based on an mtDNA study that found Galerella to be paraphyletic. The decision is probably right, but I would prefer to wait for a peer-reviewed reference that explicitly makes the suggestion.</p>
<p>Urva spelling (+/-)</p>
<p>Three differences:</p>
<p>MDD fusca vs. Hesp fuscus MDD javanica vs. Hesp javanicus MDD vitticolla vs. Hesp vitticollis The generic name is feminine, so in the first two Hesperomys is wrong and I will correct it.</p>
<p>However, vitticollis is a third-declension adjective and the feminine form is also vitticollis. Urva vitticollis is right.</p>
<p>Mustelidae</p>
<p>Ictonyx vs. Poecilictis (+)</p>
<p>I recognize Poecilictis as a genus; MDD includes it in Ictonyx. I may have done this because Koepfli et al. (2008) found Ictonyx to be paraphyletic, but that goes against my own admonition to avoid making changes that haven’t been explicitly proposed. I am synonymizing the two. Ref: Koepfli, K.-P., Deere, K.A., Slater, G.J., Begg, C., Begg, K., Grassman, L., Lucherini, M., Veron, G. and Wayne, R.K. 2008. Multigene phylogeny of the Mustelidae: Resolving relationships, tempo and biogeographic history of a mammalian adaptive radiation. BMC Biology 6(10):1-22. doi:10.1186/1741-7007-6-10</p>
<p>The spelling comment in MDD seems wrong: libyca is definitely an adjective, not a noun.</p>
<p>Lutra and related genera (+)</p>
<p>MDD accepts a recent proposal to lump Lutrogale, Amblonyx, and Aonyx into Lutra. This is a rather invasive change. It creates at least two homonymies among fossil species (robusta and indica). There are a couple of fossil genera closely related to Lutra that perhaps should also be synonymized (Algarolutra, Lutraeximia, Sardolutra). However, I will accept the change as I like reducing the number of (nearly) monotypic genera.</p>
<p>Mustela strigodorsa vs. strigidorsa (+)</p>
<p>The original spelling is in fact strigodorsa, but virtually nobody has used that spelling since. The form strigidorsa can probably be declared a justified emendation through prevailing usage.</p>
<p>AI: Confirm this and publish it.</p>
<p>Phocidae</p>
<p>Lobodon carcinophaga vs. carcinophagus (+)</p>
<p>I have carcinophagus (interpreting the epithet as an adjective agreeing in gender with masculine Lobodon), MDD has carcinophaga, interpreting the name as a noun in apposition. Rice (1998) argued that it was a noun in apposition. I am skeptical this is what the original authors intended, but it’s not worth disturbing the established nomenclature, and I’ll switch to carcinophaga.</p>
<p>Viverridae</p>
<p>Genetta fieldiana vs. maculata (-!)</p>
<p>The name Genetta maculata was explicitly rejected by the ICZN because it was preoccupied by Viverra maculata Kerr = Dasyurus maculatus.</p>
<p>This was a rather complex nomenclatural situation, with a neotype designation and significant disagreement among authors who commented on the ICZN application. But the name maculata is definitely invalid, and fieldiana appears to be the oldest available name for the species, as Grubb (2004) called out.</p>
<p>Ref:</p>
<p>Grubb, P. 2004. Comment on the proposed conservation of Viverra maculata Gray, 1830 (currently Genetta maculata; Mammalia, Carnivora). Bulletin of Zoological Nomenclature 61(2):119-122. International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. 2007. Opinion 2183 (Case 3204). Viverra maculata Gray, 1830 (currently Genetta maculata; Mammalia, Carnivora): specific name not conserved. Bulletin of Zoological Nomenclature 64(3):205-206. Paradoxurus (+/-)</p>
<p>Three differences:</p>
<p>MDD adds two species, P. musangus and P. philippinensis MDD uses the spelling musangus, I use musanga (for a subspecies at the moment) MDD calls the Sri Lanka golden palm civet zeylonensis, I use aureus I accept change (1) to add the two species recognized by Veron et al. (2014).</p>
<p>For (2), MDD comments say that musanga is an adjective and therefore should agree in gender with the species name. But it’s clearly not a classical Latin adjective. Raffles (1821), who named this species, writes that the Malay name of the animal is “Musang bulan”, so he must have slightly Latinized that name by adding -a to create the scientific name. The name sounds like a noun in apposition to me. The previous name on the page is Viverra genetta, another similar noun in apposition. (I wonder what he meant by that, as Genetta doesn’t occur on Sumatra. Maybe Viverricula?)</p>
<p>For (3), I base myself on Groves et al. (2009, p. 249). Their main conclusion (that there are three species of golden palm civets on Sri Lanka) has been rejected, but I haven’t seen any reason to doubt their argument that the name zeylonensis was more likely based on a common palm civet (P. hermaphroditus), which also occurs on Sri Lanka. That leaves aureus as the oldest name for the golden palm civet. Hi!</p>
<p>While I was working towards integrating MDD into Nomer https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/nomer/issues/141 , I noticed that:</p>
<p>https://www.mammaldiversity.org/explore.html?id=1004746</p>
<p>does not resolve, but</p>
<p>https://www.mammaldiversity.org/explore.html#genus=Rhinolophus&amp;species=sinicus&amp;id=1004746</p>
<p>does.</p>
<p>Is that intentional?</p>

<p>In order to harmonize our databases better I am adding a “recently_extinct” category to Hesperomys. I noticed two possible issues with MDD’s treatment of extinct species:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Antillomys rayi</em> is included in MDD, but it is not on the Red List and as far as I can tell there is no evidence it survived past 1500. (It probably did, like other oryzomyines from the Caribbean, but then why not also include <em>Megalomys camerhegne</em>?</li>
<li><em>Archaeolemur edwardsi</em> is included in MDD but is not on the Red List, and again I’m not aware of evidence it lived past 1500. The MDD account https://www.mammaldiversity.org/explore.html#genus=Archaeolemur&amp;species=edwardsi&amp;id=1000971 says “it is listed in MSW3 2005”, but it isn’t.</li>
<li><em>Cordimus hooijeri</em>, a species I named in 2014, was found in association with <em>Rattus</em> so we hypothesized that it survived past 1499, when the first European contact occurred on Bonaire. There have been some noises about this genus in the literature, but no formal revision. In particular, I’m not confident that this species is really related to the two other species we placed in the genus, from the Pleistocene of Curaçao. It is not on the Red List, but on the basis of your inclusion criteria it should be included. Ref: Zijlstra, J.S., McFarlane, D.A., Hoek Ostende, L.W. van den and Lundberg, J. 2014. New rodents (Cricetidae) from the Neogene of Curaçao and Bonaire, Dutch Antilles. Palaeontology 57(5):895-908. doi:10.1111/pala.12091</li>
</ul>
<p>This is another instalment of comparing the extant mammal taxonomies in MDD and my Hesperomys database, using a spreadsheet kindly prepared by Connor. I’m accepting most of the changes, but there’s a lot.</p>

<h2 id="hipposideridae">Hipposideridae</h2>
<h3 id="doryrhina-vs.-hipposideros--"><em>Doryrhina</em> vs. <em>Hipposideros</em> (-)</h3>
<p>I have two species in <em>Doryrhina</em>, MDD has eight. The source (Foley et al., 2017) only had molecular data for one species (<em>cyclops</em>). I added the related African species (<em>camerunensis</em>) and you added another six Indo-Australian ones that are thought to be related. You wrote that you’re planning to change this, so I’m going to keep this as is.</p>
<h3 id="hipposideros-swinhoei-vs.-swinhoii--"><em>Hipposideros swinhoei</em> vs. <em>swinhoii</em> (-)</h3>
<p>I have <em>swinhoii</em>, MDD has <em>swinhoei</em>.</p>
<p>The original spelling is <em>swinhoii</em>. Most recent authors use <em>swinhoei</em>, but Hill (1963) among others used the original spelling.</p>

<p>I had these as valid species following Helgen (2007), but he didn’t provide strong evidence and the change doesn’t seem to have been supported. I am moving them back to subspecies of <em>H. wollastoni</em>.</p>

<h3 id="hipposideros-khasiana"><em>Hipposideros khasiana</em> (+)</h3>
<p>This was named in 2006, rather inadequately. I had it listed as valid anyway, but it’s probably a nomen nudum since the holotype isn’t unambiguously identified (ICZN Art. 16.4.1). I would recommend MDD mention it in the comments though.</p>

<h3 id="macronycteris-vittata-vs.-vittatus--"><em>Macronycteris vittata</em> vs. <em>vittatus</em> (-)</h3>
<p>I have <em>vittata</em>, MDD has <em>vittatus</em>. I think this one is straightforward: <em>nycteris</em> is feminine and <em>vittatus</em> is an adjective, so it should be <em>vittata</em>.</p>
<p>AI: Publish this.</p>
<h2 id="miniopteridae">Miniopteridae</h2>
<h3 id="miniopterus-arenarius"><em>Miniopterus arenarius</em> (+)</h3>
<p>MDD accepts this species, I have it within <em>M. natalensis</em></p>
<p><em>Miniopterus</em> is quite a mess. MDD cites Monadjem et al. (2013). It seems that there is a genetically distinct form from Ethiopia/Arabia that may or may not be the same as <em>M. arenarius</em>, which was described from Kenya. Most recent papers do tend to treat <em>arenarius</em> as a distinct species, so I’ll follow suit.</p>
<p>Not sure if you’ve seen this recent paper with very comprehensive genetic coverage: Demos, T.C., Webala, P.W., Lutz, H.L., Kerbis Peterhans, J.C., Goodman, S.M., Cortés-Delgado, N., Bartonjo, M. and Patterson, B.D. 2019. Multilocus phylogeny of a cryptic radiation of Afrotropical long-fingered bats (Chiroptera, Miniopteridae). Zoologica Scripta 49(1):1-13. doi:10.1111/zsc.12388</p>
<h3 id="miniopterus-eschscholtzii-and-m.-blepotis"><em>Miniopterus eschscholtzii</em> and <em>M. blepotis</em> (+)</h3>
<p>These are part of the Asian segment of “<em>Miniopterus schreibersii</em>”. MDD has these two as distinct, citing the HMW account; I lump them all in <em>M. fuliginosus</em>. This is all pretty arbitrary since the genetic data is still spotty; if Asian <em>Miniopterus</em> are anything like the African ones, there are a lot more than three species in this group. However, I’ll accept the change.</p>
<h2 id="molossidae">Molossidae</h2>
<h3 id="austronomus-vs.-tadarida"><em>Austronomus</em> vs. <em>Tadarida</em> (+)</h3>
<p>MDD recognizes this genus for <em>Tadarida australis</em> and <em>T. kuboriensis</em>; I don’t.</p>
<p>Lots of generic rearrangements in the Molossidae. I am seeing several studies that found these species to be distant from the rest of <em>Tadarida</em>, so I’m accepting the change.</p>
<h3 id="chaerephon-shortridgei--"><em>Chaerephon shortridgei</em> (-)</h3>
<p>MDD synonymizes this species with <em>Mops</em> (=<em>Chaerephon</em>) <em>chapini</em>, citing batnames.org, but the current version of https://batnames.org/genera/Mops lists <em>shortridgei</em> as a valid species.</p>
<h3 id="cheiromeles-torquata-vs.-torquatus"><em>Cheiromeles torquata</em> vs. <em>torquatus</em> (+)</h3>
<p>I have <em>torquata</em>, MDD has <em>torquatus</em>. I made this change because I assumed the name derives from Latin <em>meles</em> “badger”, which is feminine, but I looked up the original description and it turns out it’s from Greek μέλος “limb” instead. That’s actually neuter, but we can safely treat the Latinized derivative <em>meles</em> as masculine instead and go back to <em>torquatus</em>.</p>
<h3 id="micronomus-ozimops-and-setirostris"><em>Micronomus</em>, <em>Ozimops</em>, and <em>Setirostris</em> (+)</h3>
<p>MDD recognizes these as genera; I have them as subgenera of <em>Mormopterus</em>.</p>
<p>The source cited by MDD is Jackson &amp; Groves (2015). They write (p. 7) that they don’t believe in subgenera and have therefore raised all subgenera to genus rank. I disagree with that stance; I think subgenera are useful. However, the molecular evidence from Amador et al. (2016 or maybe 2018, doi:10.1007/s10914-016-9363-8) indicates that at least <em>Mormopterus planiceps</em> (subgenus <em>Ozimops</em>) is distantly related to the type species of the genus, <em>M. jugularis</em>. <em>Micronomus</em> and <em>Setirostris</em> haven’t been included in phylogenetic studies with broad coverage, but I would expect them also to be distant from true <em>Mormopterus</em> so I’ll accept the change.</p>
<h3 id="chaerephon-vs.-mops"><em>Chaerephon</em> vs. <em>Mops</em></h3>
<p>I recognize <em>Chaerephon</em>; MDD synonymizes it in <em>Mops</em>.</p>
<p>Quite an invasive change but all molecular studies I’ve seen are consistent in showing that the two genera are closely related and not reciprocally monophyletic. I will accept the change.</p>
<h3 id="molossus-fluminensis-and-m.-nigricans"><em>Molossus fluminensis</em> and <em>M. nigricans</em> (+)</h3>
<p>MDD accepts these newly proposed splits from <em>Molossus rufus</em>. The evidence is solid, but it seems to me that the oldest name for <em>fluminensis</em> is actually <em>castaneus</em> Geoffroy, 1805, from Paraguay. Loureiro et al. (2020) list this name as a synonym of <em>M. rufus</em> without comment. <em>Molossus holosericus</em> from Rio de Janeiro also seems like a senior synonym of <em>fluminensis</em>. I am going to provisionally use the names proposed by Loureiro et al. (2020) until this is confirmed though.</p>
<p>They do not show a map with exact ranges for the split species, but the supplement to the companion article https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340920301700 has a list of material examined.</p>
<p>AI: Confirm and publish</p>
<h3 id="nyctinomus-vs.-tadarida--"><em>Nyctinomus</em> vs. <em>Tadarida</em> (-)</h3>
<p>I accept the genus <em>Nyctinomus</em> for <em>Tadarida aegyptiaca</em> (and <em>Nyctinomus thomasi</em>, discussed next); MDD leaves it within <em>Tadarida</em>.</p>
<p>This is based on Benda et al. (2012). They do not cite any justification, but molecular data tends to show (e.g., Ammer et al., 2016) this species is not close to <em>Tadarida teniotis</em> (the type of <em>Tadarida</em>), so this change seems as justified as most of the other genus-level changes in Molossidae.</p>
<p>There’s also a good argument to be made for recognizing the genus <em>Rhizomops</em> for <em>Tadarida brasiliensis</em>, but that one doesn’t seem to have been formally proposed so far.</p>
<p>Ref: Benda, P., Faizolâhi, K., Andreas, M., Obuch, J., Reiter, A., Ševčík, M., Uhrin, M., Vallo, P. and Ashrafi, S. 2012. Bats (Mammalia: Chiroptera) of the Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East. Part 10. Bat fauna of Iran. Acta Societatis Zoologicae Bohemicae 76:163-582.</p>
<h3 id="nyctinomus-thomasi--"><em>Nyctinomus thomasi</em> (-)</h3>
<p>I accept this species; MDD has no comments under <em>Tadarida aegyptiaca</em>.</p>
<p>My source is also Benda et al. (2012), who differentiated it from <em>N. aegyptiacus</em> based on a morphometric analysis and apparent sympatry between the two forms. I’d be willing to go back on this one if your judgment is that we need molecular data, but MDD should at least add a comment.</p>
<h3 id="tomopeas-ravum-vs.-ravus--"><em>Tomopeas ravum</em> vs. <em>ravus</em> (-)</h3>
<p>MDD spells the species name <em>ravus</em>; I have <em>ravum</em>.</p>
<p>According to Palmer (1904:682), <em>Tomopeas</em> comes from Greek ὄπεας opeas “awl”, which is neuter. The specific name, <em>ravus</em>, is a Latin adjective meaning “gray”. So I think my version is grammatically correct. Whether it’s worth disturbing the established name I’m not sure.</p>
<p>AI: Confirm and publish</p>
<h2 id="phyllostomidae">Phyllostomidae</h2>
<h3 id="anoura-aequatoris-and-a.-peruana--"><em>Anoura aequatoris</em> and <em>A. peruana</em> (-)</h3>
<p>MDD recognizes these species; I don’t. Sounds like you’re aware of the reasons and are about to synonymize them too.</p>
<h3 id="artibeus-vs.-dermanura-and-koopmania--"><em>Artibeus</em> vs. <em>Dermanura</em> and <em>Koopmania</em> (-)</h3>
<p>MDD recognizes <em>Dermanura</em> as a genus; I don’t.</p>
<p>This keeps going back and forth. Given that everyone seems to agree that <em>Artibeus</em> + <em>Dermanura</em> is monophyletic, I’d prefer to stick to the more conservative option and keep them all in a single genus, but I’m willing to change this if recognition of <em>Dermanura</em> as a genus continues to be the majority opinion.</p>
<p>The same goes for <em>Koopmania</em>, except there the evidence that the genus is being accepted is weaker.</p>
<h3 id="gardnerycteris-crenulata-vs.-crenulatum--"><em>Gardnerycteris crenulata</em> vs. <em>crenulatum</em> (-)</h3>
<p>MDD has <em>crenulatum</em>, I have <em>crenulata</em>.</p>
<p>The generic name <em>Gardnerycteris</em> is clearly based on a truncation of “Gardner” + nycteris “bat”, which is feminine. The specific epithet was actually first published as <em>crenulata</em> (in combination with <em>Phyllostoma</em>); the spelling <em>crenulatum</em> is a holdover from when the species was in <em>Mimon</em> (which is neuter).</p>
<p>AI: Publish</p>
<h3 id="lophostoma-evote-vs.-evotis--"><em>Lophostoma evote</em> vs. <em>evotis</em> (-)</h3>
<p>MDD has <em>evotis</em>, I have <em>evote</em>.</p>
<p><em>Lophostoma</em> is a neuter name (that’s why we have e.g. <em>Lophostoma brasiliense</em>). I interpret this epithet as a Latinized adjective based on Greek οὖς, ὦτος ear. Adjectives in -<em>is</em> usually have -<em>e</em> in the neuter; for example, <em>Lampronycteris brachyotis</em> was first named as <em>Schizostoma brachyote</em>. However, I can’t entirely make sense of the word <em>evotis</em> (and the original authors don’t explain). Maybe it’s a compound with εὖ “good”, but it’s also possible that it’s something unrelated to ears.</p>
<p>There is a similar case with the subspecies name <em>laephotis</em>, which I think should be <em>laephote</em>. Davis &amp; Carter (1978) derives this term from Greek φῶς phôs “light”, but I think that doesn’t make sense and it’s another -<em>otis</em> adjective.</p>
<p>AI: More research needed.</p>
<h3 id="vampyriscus-nymphaeus-vs.-nymphaea--"><em>Vampyriscus nymphaeus</em> vs. <em>nymphaea</em> (-)</h3>
<p>MDD has <em>nymphaea</em>, I have <em>nymphaeus</em>.</p>
<p>This species was recently moved from feminine <em>Vampyressa</em> to masculine <em>Vampyriscus</em>. The specific epithet is an adjective (Greek νυμφαῖος nymphaios “of the nymphs”), so it should agree in gender with the genus name.</p>
<h2 id="pteropodidae">Pteropodidae</h2>
<h3 id="desmalopex-leucoptera-and-microleucoptera-vs.-leucopterus--"><em>Desmalopex leucoptera</em> and <em>microleucoptera</em> vs. <em>leucopterus</em> (-)</h3>
<p>I have the two species as -<em>ptera</em>, MDD has -<em>pterus</em>.</p>
<p>As discussed previously under <em>Lycalopex</em>, this name is etymologically feminine. However, even the original description used the combination <em>Desmalopex leucopterus</em>, so a case could be made for sticking with the masculine forms.</p>
<h3 id="notopteris-neocaledonica-vs.-neocaledonicus--"><em>Notopteris neocaledonica</em> vs. <em>neocaledonicus</em> (-)</h3>
<p>I have <em>neocaledonica</em>, MDD has <em>neocaledonicus</em>.</p>
<p>I think this one is ambiguous. The generic name derives from Greek πτερόν pteron “wing” in a Latinized form with a new ending -<em>is</em>. ICZN Art. 30.1.3 says that such names take the gender appropriate to their Latin ending, but -<em>is</em> words in Latin can be either masculine or feminine. The form <em>neocaledonica</em> appears to be the original spelling (though I haven’t verified) and previous literature also uses that form, so it seems better to stick with it.</p>
<p>AI: Confirm and publish</p>
<h3 id="nyctimene-minuta-vs.-n.-varius--"><em>Nyctimene minuta</em> vs. <em>N. varius</em> (+/-)</h3>
<p>MDD has <em>Nyctimene varius</em>, I have <em>Nyctimene minuta</em>.</p>
<p>I accept the taxonomic change to treat <em>minutus</em> as a synonym of <em>albiventer</em> and <em>varius</em> as a distinct species.</p>
<p>However, there’s also a spelling issue: I use the forms <em>minuta</em> and <em>varia</em>. I interpret <em>Nyctimene</em> as based on Greek μήνη mene “moon”, which is feminine. However, previous authors seem to have universally treated it as masculine.</p>
<p>AI: Confirm spelling changes</p>
<h3 id="pteropus-gilliardi-vs.-gilliardorum--"><em>Pteropus gilliardi</em> vs. <em>gilliardorum</em> (-)</h3>
<p>MDD has <em>gilliardorum</em>, I have <em>gilliardi</em>.</p>
<p>The original spelling is <em>gilliardi</em>, but it was named after two Gilliards (husband and wife), so it was emended to <em>gilliardorum</em> and most authors have followed that emendation. However, my opinion is that such emendations are not permissible under the Code. Ref: Dubois, A. 2007. Genitives of species and subspecies nomina derived from personal names should not be emended. Zootaxa 1550(1):49-68. doi:10.11646/zootaxa.1550.1.2</p>
<p>This issue is going to come up a lot more in the rest of the list. I wouldn’t recommend changing anything just yet. Perhaps the ASM Nomenclature Committee has an opinion here that we can follow more generally.</p>
<p>AI: Figure out a stance.</p>
<h3 id="pteropus-loochoensis---p.-mariannus"><em>Pteropus loochoensis</em> -&gt; <em>P. mariannus</em> (+)</h3>
<p>I have this as a valid species, MDD includes it in <em>mariannus</em>. The cited source provides no justification and Okinawa (where <em>loochoensis</em> is from) is a long way from the Marianas (where <em>mariannus</em> lives), so I’m a bit skeptical. However, the merger seems to be accepted in the community, so I’ll take it.</p>
<h3 id="pteropus-intermedius---p.-vampyrus"><em>Pteropus intermedius</em> -&gt; <em>P. vampyrus</em> (+)</h3>
<p>I have this as valid, MDD includes it in <em>vampyrus</em>. MDD cites only Mlíkovský (2012), which doesn’t say anything about <em>intermedius</em>. However, the HMW volume on bats also sinks this species, so I’ll accept the synonymy.</p>
<h3 id="pteropus-vetula-vs.-p.-vetulus"><em>Pteropus vetula</em> vs. <em>P. vetulus</em> (+)</h3>
<p>MDD has <em>vetula</em>, I have <em>vetulus</em>. MDD doesn’t cite any source, but I found the spelling change in HMW. They claim that <em>vetula</em> is a noun in apposition and should remain unchanged. I looked at the original description, which calls it <em>Pteropus Vetula</em>, and they’re probably right that Jouan meant it as a noun in apposition, since he never capitalizes adjectival epithets, but does capitalize (if consistently) nouns used as epithets. I’ll accept the change, though I think a good case could be made to treat <em>vetulus</em> as a justified emendation by prevailing usage, since that spelling has been used consistently for over a century.</p>
<h3 id="pteropus-natalis--"><em>Pteropus natalis</em> (-)</h3>
<p>I have this as a valid species, you implicitly include it in <em>Pteropus melanotus</em>. My sources are James et al. (2007), a conservation report which claims that the revision that merged this species into <em>P. melanotus</em> was unjustified, and Jackson &amp; Groves (2015), who follow suit but call for more taxonomic work. That’s pretty thin and I’d be open to moving it back to a subspecies, but MDD should mention in comments that this form is sometimes recognized as valid.</p>
<h3 id="stenonycteris-lanosa-vs.-lanosus--"><em>Stenonycteris lanosa</em> vs. <em>lanosus</em> (-)</h3>
<p>MDD has <em>lanosus</em>, I have <em>lanosa</em>. This species was recently moved from masculine <em>Rousettus</em> to feminine <em>Stenonycteris</em>. I don’t think there’s much room for doubt that <em>lanosus</em> is an adjective.</p>
<p>AI: Confirm and publish</p>
<h3 id="styloctenium-mindorense-vs.-mindorensis--"><em>Styloctenium mindorense</em> vs. <em>mindorensis</em> (-)</h3>
<p>MDD has <em>mindorensis</em>, I have <em>mindorense</em>. This species was named (somewhat) recently with incorrect gender agreement.</p>
<p>AI: Confirm and publish</p>
<h2 id="rhinolophidae">Rhinolophidae</h2>
<h3 id="rhinolophus-pumilus-r.-cornutus"><em>Rhinolophus pumilus</em> &lt; <em>R. cornutus</em> (+)</h3>
<p>Species in MDD, subspecies of <em>R. cornutus</em> for me. MDD cites Wu et al. (2012), but they treat <em>pumilus</em> as a junior synonym of <em>cornutus</em> (p. 402). However, HMW does recognize <em>pumilus</em> as valid and I’ll follow suit.</p>
<p>Minor: MDD has a typo in the reference (“teh”).</p>
<h2 id="rhinonycteridae">Rhinonycteridae</h2>
<h3 id="paratriaenops-furcula"><em>Paratriaenops furcula</em></h3>
<p>Both databases agree but I noticed a mistake in the comment for this species. MDD says “generally spelt furculus, but the name has been changed to furcula to match the generic gender”. But the Code specifically says that names in -<em>ops</em> are always masculine (Art. 30.1.4.3). The comment should say that <em>furcula</em> is correct because the name is a noun in apposition.</p>
<h2 id="vespertilionidae">Vespertilionidae</h2>
<h3 id="aeorestesdasypteruslasiurus--"><em>Aeorestes</em>/<em>Dasypterus</em>/<em>Lasiurus</em> (-)</h3>
<p>MDD has <em>Aeorestes</em> and <em>Dasypterus</em> as valid genera; I have them within <em>Lasiurus</em>. This is another one that keeps changing back and forth. I’m keeping things unchanged for now but I can switch to three genera if the consensus goes that way.</p>
<h3 id="afronycteris-nana-vs.-nanus--"><em>Afronycteris nana</em> vs. <em>nanus</em> (-)</h3>
<p>I have <em>nana</em>, MDD has <em>nanus</em>. <em>Afronycteris</em> is feminine and I think the specific epithet is an adjective, so it should be <em>nana</em>.</p>
<p>However, this name was also spelled <em>nanus</em> when it was in <em>Neoromicia</em>, which is also feminine, so maybe I’m missing something.</p>
<p>AI: Confirm and publish.</p>
<h3 id="eptesicus-guadeloupensis-and-e.-lynni"><em>Eptesicus guadeloupensis</em> and <em>E. lynni</em> (+)</h3>
<p>I have these as valid species, MDD lumps them with <em>E. fuscus</em>.</p>
<p>For <em>E. guadeloupensis</em>, MDD cites Yi &amp; Latch (2022). I will follow the change, though I agree with your comments the species should perhaps be split up.</p>
<p>MDD does not discuss <em>E. lynni</em>; I have it as a species based on Genoways et al. (2005). However, it is the Jamaican representative of <em>E. fuscus</em>, and Yi &amp; Latch (2022) show that Jamaican material nests within <em>E. fuscus</em>, so I will move it back to a subspecies.</p>
<p>Ref: Genoways, H.H., Baker, R.J., Bickham, J.W. and Phillips, C.J. 2005. Bats of Jamaica. Special Publications, Museum of Texas Tech University 48:1-154.</p>
<h3 id="eptesicus-kobayashii---e.-pachyomus--"><em>Eptesicus kobayashii</em> -&gt; <em>E. pachyomus</em> (+/-)</h3>
<p>I have this species as valid. MDD comments say it is included in <em>E. serotinus</em>, but HMW puts it in <em>E. pachyomus</em> instead, which makes more geographical sense.</p>
<h3 id="glauconycteris-curryi-vs.-g.-curryae--"><em>Glauconycteris curryi</em> vs. <em>G. curryae</em> (-)</h3>
<p>Another case like <em>Pteropus gilliardi</em>.</p>
<h3 id="myotis-ancricola-and-m.-annatessae--"><em>Myotis ancricola</em> and <em>M. annatessae</em> (-)</h3>
<p>I merge these two recently named species into <em>M. nipalensis</em>; MDD recognizes them as valid.</p>
<p>Ruedi et al. (2021), as cited by MDD, shows close genetic similarity between these two and <em>M. nipalensis</em> and suggests they are conspecific, but MDD retains them as distinct. It’s definitely a borderline case, but it feels very similar to the half dozen African <em>Rhinolophus</em> (e.g. <em>cohenae</em>) that you synonymized based on similarly preliminary molecular data.</p>
<p>In addition, you synonymized a number of other Asian <em>Myotis</em> (<em>M. badius</em>, <em>M. annamiticus</em>, <em>M. csorbai</em>) based on similar levels of evidence from the same source. This feels inconsistent. I am following all the synonymies for now but it might be better to keep all these species until a more definitive taxonomic proposal.</p>
<h3 id="myotis-australis--"><em>Myotis australis</em> (-)</h3>
<p>I keep this dubious species, MDD sinks it in <em>macropus</em>. Sounds like you’re about to change this back, so I’ll hold off on changing it.</p>
<h3 id="myotis-niasensis---m.-muricola"><em>Myotis niasensis</em> -&gt; <em>M. muricola</em> (+)</h3>
<p>I think I had this one as valid based on Kruskop &amp; Borisenko (2012, the description of <em>Myotis annatessae</em>), who claim that it is probably specifically distinct. That’s more than 10 years ago and nobody seems to have agreed with them, so I’m going to put it back in <em>muricola</em> for now. Given that the type locality of <em>Myotis muricola</em> is in Nepal there’s a good chance this form will prove to belong to a different species though.</p>
<h3 id="myotis-milleri---m.-evotis"><em>Myotis milleri</em> -&gt; <em>M. evotis</em> (+)</h3>
<p>I have this as valid, MDD includes it in <em>M. evotis</em> following MSW 3. It is sometimes listed as a species (e.g. there’s a <em>Mammalian Species</em> account) but the recent consensus seems against me, so I’ll put it in <em>evotis</em>.</p>
<h3 id="neoromicia-anchietae-vs.-n.-anchieta--"><em>Neoromicia anchietae</em> vs. <em>N. anchieta</em> (-)</h3>
<p>MDD uses <em>anchieta</em>, the original spelling; I use <em>anchietae</em>.</p>
<p>This has been discussed in the literature and <em>anchietae</em> is considered a justified emendation:</p>

<h3 id="pipistrellus-murrayi"><em>Pipistrellus murrayi</em> (+)</h3>
<p>MDD splits this from <em>P. tenuis</em>. The cited source (Helgen et al. 2009) appears to be unpublished; I can’t find it online. Perhaps better to cite Jackson &amp; Groves (2015).</p>
<h3 id="plecotus-christii-vs.-christiei--"><em>Plecotus christii</em> vs. <em>christiei</em> (-)</h3>
<p>I follow Benda et al. (2006:231) in using <em>christii</em>, the original spelling, while MDD uses <em>christiei</em>. This I suppose hinges on whether the emended form is in “prevailing usage”; I’d argue it’s not since many authors now use <em>christii</em>, but it’s a subjective decision.</p>

<h3 id="baeodon--"><em>Baeodon</em> (-)</h3>
<p>I recognize this genus, MDD sinks it in <em>Rhogeessa</em>, but apparently you’re thinking of changing this.</p>
<h3 id="scotophilus-borbonicus--"><em>Scotophilus borbonicus</em> (-)</h3>
<p>I have this species while MDD includes it in <em>S. trujilloi</em>. Re-reading the paper I don’t see why they don’t simply accept it as the senior synonym of <em>trujilloi</em>. It sounds like you’re also considering changes here, so I’ll hold off on any changes.</p>
<h3 id="arielulus-torquatus-vs.-thainycteris-torquatus--"><em>Arielulus torquatus</em> vs. <em>Thainycteris torquatus</em> (-)</h3>
<p>MDD puts this species in <em>Thainycteris</em>; I have it in <em>Arielulus</em>.</p>
<p>MDD cites Francis et al. (2010), who don’t mention <em>torquatus</em>, and Guo et al. (2017), who list “<em>Thainycteris torquatus</em>” in a table header but provide no justification. Hassanin et al. (2017, description of <em>Glauconycteris atra</em>) and Görföl et al. (2020, description of <em>Mirostrellus</em>) present phylogenetic trees that include <em>torquatus</em> and <em>Arielulus circumdatus</em>, but not <em>Thainycteris aureocollaris</em>. They find <em>torquatus</em> to be sister to <em>Arielulus circumdatus</em>. That’s not conclusive since <em>aureocollaris</em> wasn’t included, but I don’t see evidence to justify the change of generic assignment.</p>
<p>Following #22, #23, #26. This covers a few smaller orders, which happen to include most of the marsupials. There were relatively few disagreements, mostly around spelling.</p>

<h3 id="murexia-melanura-vs.-melanurus--"><em>Murexia melanura</em> vs. <em>melanurus</em> (-)</h3>
<p>The original spelling (in combination with <em>Phascogale</em>) was <em>melanura</em>. It was <em>melanurus</em> when the species was in <em>Murexechinus</em>, but <em>Murexia</em> is feminine, so <em>melanura</em> is correct.</p>
<h3 id="murexia-hageni-and-m.-wilhelmina"><em>Murexia hageni</em> and <em>M. wilhelmina</em> (+)</h3>

<p>I have <em>wavica</em>, MDD has <em>wavicus</em>.</p>
<p>The genus name comes from Greek ἴκτις iktis, which is feminine. The specific epithet looks based on the type locality Wau, which would make it an adjective.</p>
<p>However, <em>Myoictis melas wavicus</em> was the original name and I don’t think anybody has ever used <em>wavica</em>.</p>

<p>Like <em>Myoictis wavica</em>, this is a case where I think the grammatical evidence is strong, but I am not convinced it’s worth disrupting the established nomenclature. (-<em>ops</em> names are always masculine per the Code; <em>irrupta</em> is clearly an adjective.)</p>

<h3 id="petaurus-biacensis-and-p.-papuanus--"><em>Petaurus biacensis</em> and <em>P. papuanus</em> (-/+)</h3>
<p>I have <em>Petaurus papuanus</em> as a species, including <em>P. biacensis</em>; MDD has <em>biacensis</em> as valid and lumps <em>papuanus</em> in <em>P. notatus</em>.</p>
<p>This is a hard case. Cremona et al. (2021) recognized <em>P. notatus</em> and <em>P. ariel</em> as valid for some Australian populations previously assigned to <em>P. breviceps</em>, leaving <em>P. breviceps</em> restricted to a small area of eastern Australia, but ignored the New Guinea populations. I got around that by declaring the oldest name from New Guinea, <em>papuanus</em>, to be a valid species, though nobody has explicitly suggested that; you instead lumped them in the geographically nearest species, <em>P. notatus</em>, even though Malekian et al. (2010) found the New Guinea populations to be distant from <em>P. notatus</em> (their AUS2 clade). Both options are problematic. I’d like to propose an alternative: put the New Guinea material back in <em>P. breviceps</em> until somebody gets around to formally separating them. That way, at least their species name only has to change once.</p>
<p>I don’t know however why I lumped <em>P. biacensis</em> into <em>P. papuanus</em>. I’m going to move it back to a species.</p>

<p>Following #22, #23, #26, #27, this installment covers the insectivores. This was rather simpler than I expected, probably because I recently went over the HMW volume for insectivores. Still, there are some disagreements that merit further discussion.</p>

<h2 id="eulipotyphla-vs.-lipotyphla">Eulipotyphla vs. Lipotyphla (+)</h2>
<p>I haven’t systematically looked for discrepancies in classification above the genus level, but noticed here that MDD has Eulipotyphla while I have Lipotyphla. I like Lipotyphla better because it is shorter and Asher &amp; Helgen (2010) supported it, but Eulipotyphla seems to be the current consensus so I’ll switch. Interestingly, a lot of the Russian literature uses Lipotyphla instead.</p>

<p>MDD has <em>gymnurus</em>, I have <em>gymnura</em>, which is the traditional form.</p>
<p>The original combination was <em>Viverra gymnura</em>. If you interpret that as an adjective, then it should indeed be <em>gymnurus</em> in combination with masculine <em>Echinosorex</em>, but interpreting it as a noun in apposition would allow to preserve the prevailing spelling. However, Raffles writes <em>gymnura</em> in lowercase, which in his work is usually an indication that the specific name is an adjective.</p>

<p>I missed these two new species that have since been synonymized under <em>dongyangjiangensis</em>.</p>
<p>You have the year of description as 2020. I can’t read Chinese but I’m pretty sure the second-to-last paragraph of the paper synonymizing them is saying <em>dongyangjiangensis</em> was published on 2019-12-26 and <em>huangshanensis</em> on 2020-01-15. I can’t confirm these dates (the API I use for DOI dates apparently doesn’t cover the Chinese ones), and at least the description of <em>dongyangjiangensis</em> doesn’t have an LSID, so the print publication date is what matters, not the online one.</p>
<h3 id="crocidura-tarfayaensis-vs.-tarfayensis--"><em>Crocidura tarfayaensis</em> vs. <em>tarfayensis</em> (-)</h3>
<p>MDD has <em>tarfayensis</em>, I have <em>tarfayaensis</em>.</p>
<p>My spelling is the original (I recently found the original description online and can share it if you like).</p>
<p>Both spellings occur in the recent literature, so I don’t see any reason not to use the original spelling. The alternative spelling <em>tarfayensis</em> apparently goes back to Honacki et al. (1982).</p>
<p>AI: Confirm and publish</p>
<h3 id="chimarrogale-vs.-crossogale--"><em>Chimarrogale</em> vs. <em>Crossogale</em> (-)</h3>
<p>MDD has <em>Crossogale</em> as a separate genus, I have it within <em>Chimarrogale</em>.</p>
<p>I also added this genus when I saw Abramov et al. (2017), but HMW (vol. 8, p. 336) refused to recognize the genus, saying it was “rushed”. Looking back at Abramov et al. (2017) I don’t think the evidence for this revision is very strong. They only have cytb data for <em>C. phaeura</em> (=<em>Crossogale</em>), but the combined genus <em>Chimarrogale</em> appears to be monophyletic. So I think HMW’s decision is right here.</p>
<h3 id="episoriculus-vs.-pseudosoriculus--"><em>Episoriculus</em> vs. <em>Pseudosoriculus</em> (-)</h3>
<p>This is a similar case, where MDD recognizes the newly named genus <em>Pseudosoriculus</em> (split from <em>Episoriculus</em>), but I don’t because I was following HMW.</p>
<p>However, the evidence for this one is much stronger than for <em>Crossogale</em>. There is data from three different genes showing <em>Pseudosoriculus fumidus</em> is phylogenetically distant from the rest of <em>Episoriculus</em>. I’ll wait for your reply on both of these cases but I’m inclined to accept the genus as valid.</p>
<h3 id="sorex-monticolus-vs.-s.-monticola--"><em>Sorex monticolus</em> vs. <em>S. monticola</em> (-)</h3>
<p>MDD has <em>monticola</em> (with comments saying it is a noun in apposition), I have <em>monticolus</em>.</p>
<p>If the original spelling was <em>monticola</em> I’d agree with you, but the original spelling is in fact <em>monticolus</em>. Woodman (2018) argues that the original spelling was in error and notes that Merriam later corrected it to <em>monticola</em>. However, such an emendation is justified only if it’s in prevailing usage, and I don’t think this one qualifies (e.g. Google Scholar has 39 hits for <em>Sorex monticola</em> and 912 for <em>Sorex monticolus</em>).</p>
<h3 id="suncus-varilla-vs.-s.-varillus--"><em>Suncus varilla</em> vs. <em>S. varillus</em> (-)</h3>
<p>MDD has <em>varillus</em>, I have <em>varilla</em>.</p>
<p>This was originally named in combination with <em>Crocidura</em> (feminine) but is now in <em>Suncus</em> (masculine).</p>
<p>This word doesn’t appear in Latin dictionaries I have checked, but it sounds like an adjective to me (cf. <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-illus">the -illus suffix</a>). However, since there is uncertainty it might be better to stick with the original spelling.</p>
<p>AI: Confirm</p>
<p>Continuing #22, #23, #26, #27, #28 with a number of small orders. There are a number of spelling issues, and some taxonomic disagreements in the lagomorphs.</p>

<p>Straightforward accepted changes: * New splits * <em>Dendrohyrax validus</em> &lt; <em>D. arboreus</em> (minor: MDD has a typo in the comment, “form” for “from”, and is missing page numbers for the <em>Mammals of Africa</em> reference, should be 158–161)</p>
<p>Relatedly, I noticed that there is a subspecies <em>Dendrohyrax arboreus mimus</em> recognized by <em>Mammals of Africa</em>; MDD also lists <em>mimus</em> as a synonym for <em>arboreus</em>. However, the original name was <em>Procavia mima</em>, and I believe it is a noun in apposition because there is no Latin adjective <em>mimus</em>. Therefore, the correct combination is <em>Dendrohyrax arboreus mima</em>.</p>

<h3 id="lepus-microtis-vs.-l.-victoriae--"><em>Lepus microtis</em> vs. <em>L. victoriae</em> (-)</h3>
<p>I use <em>Lepus microtis</em> (agreeing with MSW 3), MDD uses <em>Lepus victoriae</em> (agreeing with HMW and <em>Mammals of Africa</em>).</p>
<p>MDD acknowledges that <em>microtis</em> is older but retains <em>victoriae</em> because it was used in previous publications and because <em>microtis</em> is a nomen nudum. I looked at the original description of <em>microtis</em> and it is definitely not a nomen nudum; Heuglin gives a thorough description that runs for about a page. The holotype is still in existence in Stuttgart. I don’t find the argument that <em>victoriae</em> is in common usage particularly convincing either, since MSW3 used <em>microtis</em> and the species has previously been known under various other names.</p>
<h2 id="ochotonidae">Ochotonidae</h2>
<h3 id="ochotona-dabashanensis-and-o.-xunhuaensis--"><em>Ochotona dabashanensis</em> and <em>O. xunhuaensis</em> (-!)</h3>
<p>I have these two as valid species, MDD synonymizes them under <em>Ochotona sikimaria</em>.</p>
<p>MDD cites Wang et al. (2020), but their tree places <em>Ochotona sikimaria</em> distant (within subgenus <em>Ochotona</em>) from <em>dabashanensis</em> and <em>xunhuaensis</em> (within subgenus <em>Alienauroa</em>, sister to <em>O. sacraria</em>). Therefore, I don’t think synonymy with <em>sikimaria</em> is supported by the sources. However, a case could be made for synonymizing <em>xunhuaensis</em> and <em>dabashanensis</em>, as they are not reciprocally monophyletic; <em>xunhuaensis</em> would have priority.</p>
<h3 id="prolagidae">Prolagidae</h3>
<p>MDD puts <em>Prolagus</em> in its own family Prolagidae; I place it within Ochotonidae.</p>
<p>There is little hard evidence here (nobody seems to have gotten aDNA for <em>Prolagus</em> yet, for one), but the western European paleontological literature mostly keeps <em>Prolagus</em> within Ochotonidae. The most explicit discussion is in Angelone et al. (2014). However, Russian authors tend to follow Erbajeva and recognize the family Prolagidae. <em>Prolagus</em> apparently has a long independent history, going back into the Oligocene.</p>
<p>This is entirely a subjective question; I chose to put <em>Prolagus</em> within Ochotonidae because that’s what almost all recent papers discussing it do. (<em>Prolagus</em> is a fairly common fossil in the Miocene and Pliocene of Europe.)</p>

<li>Hesp <em>Peroryctes raffrayanus</em> vs. MDD <em>raffrayana</em></li>

<p>The generic names come from Greek ὀρύκτης oryktes “digger”, which is masculine. Other similar names in extant mammals, like <em>Notoryctes</em>, <em>Tachyoryctes</em>, and <em>Oryzorictes</em> are consistently treated as masculine. Indeed, when Thomas named <em>Peroryctes</em>, he listed the type species as “<em>P. raffrayanus</em>”. However, when Stein named <em>Microperoryctes</em> he used the feminine <em>murina</em>.</p>
<p>I think <em>longicauda</em> is reasonably interpreted as a noun in apposition, so I’m going to change back to MDD’s term. However, the other two are clearly adjectives and I believe the masculine form is correct.</p>

<h3 id="cuviers-tableau-élémentaire">Cuvier’s <em>Tableau élémentaire</em></h3>
<p>Cuvier, G. 1797. Tableau élémentaire de l’histoire naturelle des animaux. Baudouin, 710 pp.</p>
<p>This is usually listed as 1798, but Jackson &amp; Groves (2015) cite it as 1797. Their source is a bibliographic notice by Roux (1797). I verified the source at https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5481905n/f1.item# . It is a bibliographic magazine, published on 24 December 1797, that lists the <em>Tableau élémentaire</em>, proving that the book must have been published by then.</p>
<p>Among species currently considered valid, this affects <em>Hemicentetes semispinosus</em>. See #22, #23, #26, #27, #28, #29 for the previous issues. cc <span class="citation" data-cites="connorjburgin">@connorjburgin</span></p>

</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>In all cases, there is no doubt about the monophyly of the genus that was split up.</p>
<p>I currently accept none of these splits; MDD accepts the <em>Cebus</em> and <em>Callicebus</em> split but not the <em>Saguinus</em> ones.</p>
<p>I’m not fond of any of these splits. The arguments about ecological and behavioral distinctness are fine I suppose, but as long as there is no agreed-upon definition of a genus they aren’t very convincing. The divergence time arguments at least give hope for a consistent criterion for recognizing genera, but when people use this argument they usually cite Goodman et al. (1998). That paper proposed merging <em>Cacajao</em> and <em>Chiropotes</em> (and <em>Homo</em> and <em>Pan</em>), and nobody has wanted to follow that, so divergence time arguments also feel like special pleading to me.</p>
<p>However, these are subjective decisions and most of these splits seem to have been broadly accepted, so I’ll probably have to follow suit. I’m not sure I see a principled reason to accept the <em>Cebus</em> and <em>Callicebus</em> splits but not the <em>Saguinus</em> one.</p>
<h2 id="atelidae">Atelidae</h2>
<h3 id="alouatta-villosa-vs.-a.-pigra"><em>Alouatta villosa</em> vs. <em>A. pigra</em> (+)</h3>
<p>I use <em>Alouatta villosa</em>, MDD uses <em>A. pigra</em>.</p>
<p>I don’t find the arguments for <em>pigra</em> very compelling, but I’ll accept this one for consistency with the literature.</p>
<h3 id="lagothrix-lagothricha-vs.-lagotricha--"><em>Lagothrix lagothricha</em> vs. <em>lagotricha</em> (-)</h3>
<p>I use <em>lagotricha</em>, MDD uses <em>lagothricha</em>.</p>
<p>The original spelling is <em>lagotricha</em>. A lot of the literature also uses this spelling (it actually gets more hits in Google Scholar than <em>lagothricha</em>), so I think we should stick with the original.</p>
<h2 id="callithrichidae">Callithrichidae</h2>
<h3 id="callitrichinae-vs.-callitrichidae-vs.-callithrichidae">Callitrichinae vs. Callitrichidae vs. Callithrichidae (?)</h3>
<p>I put the marmosets and tamarins in subfamily Callithrichinae of Cebidae; MDD recognizes a separate family Callitrichidae.</p>
<p>Looking at recent phylogenetic studies, my version of Cebidae is paraphyletic because <em>Aotus</em> falls within the cebinae-callitrichine clade, so something will need to change: either <em>Aotus</em> should go into Cebidae or Callitrichinae should become a family. MDD currently chooses the latter option. However, several recent sources (e.g., Wang et al., 2019; Silvestro et al., 2019) choose the former option instead. I like that because it creates a more informative classification; the three-family option leaves us without a name for the Cebidae/Callitrichidae/Aotidae clade. It’s a subjective decision so I am happy to go with either; I’m curious what the motivation is for MDD’s classification.</p>
<p>Separately, there is an issue of spelling. The genus name is <em>Callithrix</em> with an h, so I use the subfamily name Callithrichinae, but the family-group name is almost invariably spelled without an h in the literature (including in MDD), as Callitrichidae or Callitrichinae. If there’s a rule of Greek grammar that leads to this change, I’m not aware of it. However, this spelling goes back to Thomas (1903) who first named the family.</p>
<p>AI: Confirm and publish about the spelling of the family name.</p>
<h2 id="cebidae">Cebidae</h2>
<h3 id="cebus-sensu-stricto--"><em>Cebus</em> sensu stricto (-)</h3>
<p>Within <em>Cebus</em> sensu stricto (i.e. excluding <em>Sapajus</em>), I recognize four species, and MDD recognizes an additional 11 following Boubli et al. (2012), while noting that the taxonomy is highly contentious. I haven’t fully attempted to understand all the disagreements here, but I noticed that Ruiz-García et al. (2018) reviewed Ecuadorian <em>Cebus</em> more recently and found no support for the species status of <em>Cebus aequatorialis</em>. All of these studies have just been based on mtDNA too, which might be muddying things up more.</p>
<p>I’m open to changing to the many-species classification, but wanted to hear your thoughts first.</p>
<h2 id="cercopithecidae">Cercopithecidae</h2>
<h3 id="lophocebus-species--"><em>Lophocebus</em> species (-)</h3>
<p>I recognize six species of <em>Lophocebus</em>; MDD merges them into only two, citing the Red List, which in turn says that this was the consensus at a workshop. However, both HMW and <em>Mammals of Africa</em> list the full six species. I’d like to stick with that until there is a real published study to the contrary.</p>
<h3 id="piliocolobus-lulindicus--"><em>Piliocolobus lulindicus</em> (-)</h3>
<p>MDD recognizes this species as distinct from <em>P. foai</em>; I don’t. <em>Mammals of Africa</em> has <em>foai</em> and <em>lulindicus</em> as separate subspecies of <em>rufomitratus</em>; HMW has <em>foai</em> as a species with <em>lulindicus</em> as a junior synonym.</p>
<p>MDD cites <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/18262/96192471">the Red List</a>, but the account essentially says that it is recognized as distinct because it is threatened. That’s not a convincing taxonomic argument.</p>
<h3 id="trachypithecus-crepuscula---t.-crepusculus"><em>Trachypithecus crepuscula</em> -&gt; <em>T. crepusculus</em> (+)</h3>
<p>I have <em>crepuscula</em>, MDD has <em>crepusculus</em>.</p>
<p>I’ll accept the change for now since <em>crepusculus</em> is common in the literature, but I’m not convinced this is right since I can’t find an adjective <em>crepusculus</em>. There is a Latin word <em>crepusculum</em> “darkness” but I’m not sure how it applies; Elliot described the fur as pale when he named the species.</p>
<p>AI: Confirm and maybe change back to <em>crepuscula</em>.</p>
<h2 id="cheirogaleidae">Cheirogaleidae</h2>
<h3 id="microcebus-mittermeieri--"><em>Microcebus mittermeieri</em> (-)</h3>
<p>I lump this species under <em>M. lehilahytsara</em>; MDD recognizes it, saying that further work is needed to confirm the synonymy.</p>
<p>MDD doesn’t cite the reference I was using for the synonymy (Poelstra et al., 2021). I thought the genetic evidence in that paper was convincing, but I’m happy to add the species back if you disagree.</p>

<h3 id="avahi-ramanantsoavani-vs.-ramanantsoavanai--"><em>Avahi ramanantsoavani</em> vs. <em>ramanantsoavanai</em> (-)</h3>
<p>I use the spelling without the <em>-a-</em>, MDD includes it.</p>
<p>The former (<em>ramanantsoavani</em>) is the original and correct spelling. The first usage of the <em>ramanantsoavanai</em> spelling which I have found is in Markolf et al. (2011), where it looks accidental (they also misspell <em>peyrierasi</em> a few lines up). Possibly this spelling change was intentional since the species was named after Georges Ramanantsoavana, but I don’t see a justification for changing the name; it’s legitimate to elide the <em>-a</em> when forming a patronym.</p>

Though now I see that Silva et al. (2013) map <em>melanocephalus</em>, <em>ouakary</em>, <em>hosomi</em>, and <em>ayresi</em> all in different places, so may be it’s more complicated than I thought.</p>

<h2 id="bathyergidae">Bathyergidae</h2>
<h3 id="cryptomys"><em>Cryptomys</em> (+)</h3>
<p>I accept MDD’s provisional reclassification following Monadjem et al. (2015), sinking <em>holosericeus</em> and adding four additional species. However, I have some nitpicks about synonyms.</p>
<p>The MDD website gives no synonyms for <em>Cryptomys pretoriae</em>. Based on the maps in Monadjem et al. (2015), I believe the following synonyms should go into <em>pretoriae</em>: <em>anomalus</em>, <em>arenarius</em>, <em>jamesoni</em>, <em>komatiensis</em> (although this one is borderline), <em>montanus</em>, and <em>palki</em>. Possibly <em>melanostictus</em> and <em>rufulus</em> should also go into <em>pretoriae</em>, but I kept them in <em>natalensis</em> for now. Unfortunately the sources don’t explicitly discuss allocation of synonyms. Among the names listed under <em>hottentotus</em>, it seems to me that <em>jorisseni</em> Jameson, 1909 from Watersberg, Limpopo Province, is from within the range of <em>pretoriae</em> Roberts, 1913, and would be a senior synonym.</p>
<p>Minor: MDD’s <em>Fukomys</em> comments have a typo, the second mention of <em>Coetomys</em> is misspelled <em>Coelomys</em>.</p>
<h3 id="heliophobius-kapiti--"><em>Heliophobius kapiti</em> (-)</h3>
<p>I recognize this species; MDD puts it in <em>Heliophobius argenteocinereus</em>.</p>
<p>My reference was Uhrová et al. (2022), which isn’t cited in the MDD. I’m open to changing this back but would like to see if that paper would be enough for you to reconsider adding <em>kapiti</em>.</p>
<p>I noticed that <em>kapiti</em> is probably not the oldest name for the proposed northern species of <em>Heliophobius</em>; I wrote to the authors about that but haven’t received a response yet.</p>

<p>We both recognize two species of <em>Hydrochoerus</em>, as in MSW 3, but I was curious if you had seen Byrne et al. (2021), who showed that <em>isthmius</em> is basically not genetically distinct from the rest of the capybaras.</p>

<h3 id="pediolagus-mdd-vs.-dolichotis-hesp--"><em>Pediolagus</em> (MDD) vs. <em>Dolichotis</em> (Hesp) (-)</h3>
<p>MDD recognizes the genus <em>Pediolagus</em>, I do not.</p>
<p>Recognizing <em>Pediolagus</em> is problematic for me because it would leave several fossil species stranded. Madozzo-Jaén et al. (2021) recently reviewed a fossil <em>Dolichotis</em> and explicitly rejected the genus <em>Pediolagus</em>.</p>

<h2 id="ctenomyidae">Ctenomyidae (+)</h2>
<p>MDD recognizes a family Ctenomyidae; I put <em>Ctenomys</em> in Octodontidae. It seems to be universally agreed that <em>Ctenomys</em> is sister to the octodontids, so this is purely a subjective decision on rank.</p>
<p>I made this change based on paleontological papers like Verzi et al. (2014) that placed Ctenomyidae as a subfamily of Octodontidae. However, more recent paleontological literature (e.g., Boivin et al., 2019; De Santi et al., 2021) goes back to recognizing Ctenomyidae as a family, so I will change back to recognizing Ctenomyidae as a family.</p>

I looked at that paper and they do not say anything about <em>B. contractus</em>. (They don’t list <em>B. contractus</em> among recently extinct species, but that might as well be because they believe it went extinct earlier.) On a quick look I couldn’t find any reference that casts doubt on the validity of <em>B. contractus</em>.</p>
<h3 id="heteropsomys-antillensis--"><em>Heteropsomys antillensis</em> (-)</h3>
<p>A similar situation here, where MDD tentatively sinks this species under <em>H. insulans</em>. This one has slightly more support: Turvey et al. (2007) say “<em>Heteropsomys insulans</em> (?=<em>Homopsomys antillensis</em>)”. However, Borroto Páez et al. (2012) still recognize both species as valid.</p>
<p>In both cases, I can easily believe that these subfossil species have been oversplit, but I’d prefer to maintain the current taxonomy until there is a more definite taxonomic revision.</p>

<h3 id="hyperplagiodontia-araeum-mdd-vs.-araea-hesp"><em>Hyperplagiodontia araeum</em> (MDD) vs. <em>araea</em> (Hesp) (+)</h3>
<p>The specific name is certainly an adjective; Ray expressly says that it derives from Greek ἀραιόν “narrow”. However, what is the gender of the generic name? Names in -<em>odontia</em> are generally feminine (e.g., <em>Aplodontia rufa</em>), but everybody who has named a <em>Plagiodontia</em> species seems to have used the neuter (e.g., <em>hylaeum</em>, <em>ipnaeum</em>, <em>spelaeum</em>). I suspect it’s because Cuvier named the first species <em>Plagiodontia aedium</em>, and in that name the -<em>um</em> is not a neuter ending but a genitive plural. If the name is really feminine, then the names of <em>Plagiodontia ipnaeum</em> and <em>P. spelaeum</em> should also change. However, maybe it’s better to just treat the name as neuter now. For now I’m going to go back to <em>araeum</em>.</p>

<h3 id="makalata-obscura-mdd-vs.-loncheres-obscura-hesp--"><em>Makalata obscura</em> (MDD) vs. <em>Loncheres obscura</em> (Hesp) (-)</h3>
<p>I treat this name as a nomen dubium, and my rule in the database is to use the original combination for nomina dubia. I might reconsider that rule and change the species name to <em>Makalata obscura</em>, but I’m going to punt on that for now.</p>
<p>I list this species as a nomen dubium based on <em>Mammals of South America</em> and Miranda et al. (2021). I would suggest that MDD shouldn’t include this species, as your aim generally is to cover valid species. There are many other nomina dubia based on extant mammals, and they aren’t included in MDD either.</p>

<h3 id="mesocapromys-nana-mdd-vs.-nanus-hesp"><em>Mesocapromys nana</em> (MDD) vs. <em>nanus</em> (Hesp) (+)</h3>
<p>MDD comments say that as <em>nana</em> is the original spelling and it is a noun, the original form should be preserved. I was surprised to learn that this is true; dictionaries list <em>nanus</em> only as a noun (meaning “dwarf”), and <em>nana</em> as a female noun. In practice it seems to me that the word is treated as an adjective in zoological nomenclature, in that people use <em>nanus</em> with masculine and <em>nana</em> with feminine genera, but under a strict reading of the Code these names should be treated as nouns in apposition, which stay the same regardless of generic assignment.</p>
<p>There are at least two other valid species of mammals that are affected if we treat this name consistently: * <em>Afronycteris nanus</em>, which I suggested in #26 should be changed to <em>nana</em>. In fact, the original name was <em>Vespertilio nanus</em>, so if we treat it as a noun, we should keep it as <em>Afronycteris nanus</em>. * <em>Mazama nana</em>, which was originally <em>Cervus nanus</em>, and therefore should now be <em>Mazama nanus</em>.</p>
<p>AI: Confirm situation for all three names.</p>

<h3 id="sciurus-robinsoni-alacris"><em>Sciurus robinsoni alacris</em></h3>
<p>This split (<em>Sundasciurus robinsoni</em> from <em>S. lowii</em>) is well-supported and I accept it. However, I noticed that Hinckley et al. (2020) list <em>Sciurus robinsoni alacris</em> Thomas, 1908, as a synonym of <em>Sundasciurus robinsoni</em>, but in my database it is under <em>Rhinosciurus laticaudatus</em>. MSW3, HMW, and MDD also list this name under <em>Rhinosciurus laticaudatus</em>. I think this is due to confusion between <em>Sciurus robinsoni</em> Bonhote, 1903, and <em>Rhinosciurus robinsoni</em> Thomas, 1908, two different and unrelated squirrels. In his original description, Thomas explicitly associates his new subspecies with Bonhote’s name, and in Chasen (1940) it is listed as a synonym of <em>Sciurus lowii robinsoni</em>. I think somewhere along the line someone got confused and moved the name to <em>Rhinosciurus</em>. I haven’t seen Corbet &amp; Hill (1992) but maybe they have more pertinent information.</p>
<p>For now I’m moving <em>alacris</em> to <em>Sundasciurus robinsoni</em> and not recognizing any subspecies in <em>Rhinosciurus laticudatus</em>.</p>
<h3 id="genera-of-sciurini--">Genera of Sciurini (-)</h3>
<p>MDD here follows the classical arrangement, with <em>Sciurus</em> including the Eurasian red squirrel and most American species, but <em>Microsciurus</em> and <em>Syntheosciurus</em> in separate genera. I instead follow the rearrangement by Abreu-Júnior’s group (2020), which takes all American species out of <em>Sciurus</em> into numerous revalidated genera, and rearranges them together with <em>Microsciurus</em> and <em>Syntheosciurus</em>. This arrangement is similar to that of Vivo &amp; Carmignotto (2015) in <em>Mammals of South America</em> but differs in details; some of their genera were not monophyletic.</p>
<p>Two arguments drove me to switch to the new classification:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Sciurus</em> and <em>Microsciurus</em> in the old classification were clearly not monophyletic, so it’s good to attempt to fix the issue.</li>
<li>The new arrangement (or variants of it) seems to have become widely accepted in the South American literature.</li>
</ul>
<p>The biggest problem with this arrangement is that it leaves two species, <em>Microsciurus flaviventer</em> and <em>M. sabanillae</em>, stranded without a valid genus name. I currently have them unallocated to genus (which is why I had <em>flaviventer</em> revert to its original name, <em>Macroxus flaviventer</em>). In addition, <em>Microsciurus santanderensis</em> and <em>Microsciurus simonsi</em> have not yet been studied genetically. I left them in <em>Microsciurus</em> but the more conservative option would have been to also make them direct children of Sciurini. I think they may turn out to belong with <em>Leptosciurus</em>. Alternatively, we could leave all these species in <em>Microsciurus</em> until someone gets around to naming a new genus.</p>
<p>Another tricky case is <em>Sciurus richmondi</em>. I currently have it under <em>Guerlinguetus</em> which is clearly wrong. Abreu et al. (2020) had a single sample of <em>richmondi</em> and recovered it within <em>Syntheosciurus granatensis</em>, but in their discussion they said future work was needed before a taxonomic change could be made. For now I will recognize <em>richmondi</em> as a valid species of <em>Syntheosciurus</em>.</p>
<p>Personally I feel the new generic arrangement is oversplit; all Neotropical Sciurini or even all American Sciurini could have been put into a single genus, avoiding the problems with unallocated species. As discussed below, there are several cases where animals that were until recently placed in the same species are now placed in different genera, which suggests that the genera aren’t easily differentiated morphologically. However, that’s not what the literature proposed so I don’t see it an option for the database. It would be a useful case to look at though if we do a broader study of genus definitions in mammals, as you suggested on the Primates thread.</p>
<p>On balance I think the reclassification should be accepted but with the uncertain species left in <em>Microsciurus</em>, given that old <em>Sciurus</em> is clearly nonmonophyletic and the classification has been broadly accepted in the literature. It’s unfortunate that <em>Microsciurus</em> will remain diphyletic for now, but the new classification is still a clear improvement.</p>
<h3 id="microsciurus-species--"><em>Microsciurus</em> species (-)</h3>
<p>Following <em>Mammals of South America</em> I recognize an additional six species among the species MDD allocates to <em>Microsciurus</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>boquetensis</em> and <em>isthmius</em> are split from <em>mimulus</em> and placed within <em>Leptosciurus</em></li>
<li><em>otinus</em> and <em>similis</em> are split from <em>flaviventer</em> and placed within <em>Leptosciurus</em>, phylogenetically distant from true <em>flaviventer</em> (which is in the unnamed genus)</li>
<li><em>simonsi</em> is split from <em>flaviventer</em>, but left unallocated because there is no molecular data. Its geographic distribution west of the Andes would suggest it should go with <em>Leptosciurus</em>.</li>
<li><em>sabanillae</em> is split from <em>flaviventer</em>, but is sister to <em>flaviventer</em> (and an unnamed species) genetically.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Mammals of South America</em> also recognizes <em>venustulus</em> as a species, split from <em>alfari</em>, but Abreu et al. (2020) found that it is nested within <em>alfari</em>, and I follow them in synonymizing <em>venustulus</em> with <em>alfari</em>.</p>
<p>I adopted these splits in my database because <em>Mammals of South America</em> is an authoritative reclassification that I felt would set a new baseline for the classification of this group. The molecular data of Abreu’s group confirms at the very least that <em>otinus</em> and <em>similis</em> have nothing to do with <em>flaviventer</em>. Whether all of these species are really valid is more debatable; <em>boquetensis</em> and <em>isthmius</em> in particular seem quite close genetically.</p>
<h3 id="guerlinguetus-species--"><em>Guerlinguetus</em> species (-)</h3>
<p>Among species in the “<em>Guerlinguetus</em>” group, I follow <em>Mammals of South America</em> in recognizing <em>brasiliensis</em> as distinct from <em>aestuans</em>, but synonymizing <em>gilvigularis</em> under <em>aestuans</em>.</p>
<p>Abreu’s papers recognize <em>brasiliensis</em> as distinct from <em>aestuans</em>, but suggest that <em>aestuans</em> as currently recognized is composite. However, there is no support for <em>gilvigularis</em> as a different species.</p>
<p>There is clearly more work to be done here, but I think the <em>aestuans</em>/<em>brasiliensis</em> classification better reflects what we currently know about these squirrels.</p>
<h3 id="simosciurus-species--"><em>Simosciurus</em> species (-)</h3>
<p>Here I follow <em>Mammals of South America</em> in splitting <em>nebouxii</em> from <em>stramineus</em>. Molecular data shows that these two are sister to each other but quite distinct, so this split seems well-supported.</p>
<h3 id="sciurushadrosciurus-flammifer--"><em>Sciurus</em>/<em>Hadrosciurus flammifer</em> (-)</h3>
<p>I include <em>Sciurus flammifer</em> in <em>Hadrosciurus igniventris</em> following <em>Mammals of South America</em>.</p>
<p>Populations of <em>flammifer</em> (southern Venezuela) haven’t been included in Abreu’s molecular studies. I would follow the synonymy for now, but more confirmation is needed.</p>
<h3 id="sciurushadrosciurus-sanborni--"><em>Sciurus</em>/<em>Hadrosciurus sanborni</em> (-)</h3>
<p>MDD has this species as valid, I put it in <em>Hadrosciurus ignitus</em>.</p>
<p><em>Mammals of South America</em> included <em>sanborni</em> as a synonym of <em>Notosciurus pucheranii boliviensis</em>, but Abreu’s work showed that <em>pucheranii</em> was composite: the nominotypical subspecies is related to some former <em>Microsciurus</em> and is now placed in <em>Leptosciurus</em>, while the other subspecies are within <em>Hadrosciurus</em> and are now recognized as <em>Hadrosciurus ignitus</em>. Thus, I now list <em>sanborni</em> as a synonym of <em>Hadrosciurus ignitus boliviensis</em>.</p>
<p>There doesn’t appear to be molecular data for <em>sanborni</em> specifically (from the mountains of Peru). This is therefore a similar case to <em>flammifer</em>; I would recognize the synonymy for now.</p>

<h3 id="heteromys-mdd-vs.-liomys-schaeferia-hesp"><em>Heteromys</em> (MDD) vs. <em>Liomys</em>, <em>Schaeferia</em> (Hesp) (+)</h3>
<p>I recognize <em>Liomys</em> and <em>Schaeferia</em> as separate genera, MDD lumps them into <em>Heteromys</em> because Hafner et al. (2007) found the old genus <em>Liomys</em> to be paraphyletic. The three-genus arrangement was suggested independently by Anderson &amp; Gutiérrez (2009) and Ramírez-Pulido et al. (2014), but it hasn’t been accepted and I will put them all in a single genus. (Side note because it confused me when I was doing searches for this name: there is also a collembolan genus <em>Schaefferia</em> with two f’s that is sometimes misspelled <em>Schaeferia</em>. It doesn’t preoccupy the heteromyid name.)</p>

<h3 id="sminthidae-mdd-vs.-sicistidae-hesp--">Sminthidae (MDD) vs. Sicistidae (Hesp) (-)</h3>
<p>I have a note under this family: “Has priority over Sminthidae under Art. 40.2 of the Code, because Allen (1901) replaced Sminthinae with Sicistinae when he recognized <em>Sminthus</em> as a junior synonym of <em>Sicista</em>.” I still think that’s correct, but need to check whether anyone else has discussed this situation. I should publish this along with the Nannosciurinae/Callosciurinae situation. I think MDD should keep Sminthidae for now.</p>
<h3 id="sicista-tianshanica--"><em>Sicista tianshanica</em> (-!)</h3>
<p>We both currently spell this name <em>tianshanica</em>, but the paper describing <em>S. talgarica</em> and <em>S. terskeica</em> noted that the correct original spelling is <em>tianschanica</em>. I confirmed this is correct: https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/8352391</p>
<p>I am changing the spelling to <em>tianschanica</em> and I would recommend MDD make the change too. (After I wrote this I realized you already told me you’re making this change.)</p>
<p>Separately, the front matter for the volume says it was printed in March 1904 (“напечатано по распоряжению Императорской Академии наук. Мартъ, 1904 г. Непременный Секретарь, Академикъ Н. Дубровиць”), so the date should be changed to 1904.</p>

<h3 id="additional-species-of-napaeozapus-and-zapus--">6 additional species of <em>Napaeozapus</em> and <em>Zapus</em> (-)</h3>
<p>MDD accepts the splits by Malaney et al. (2017), recognizing 10 instead of 4 species of American zapodids; I do not.</p>
<p>I saw this paper when it was published but didn’t accept their suggested taxonomy because they introduced a nomen nudum and because it seemed good to wait to see if the new classification would be accepted. I don’t think there have been further studies of zapodid genetics since then, but I can find few references that accept the split. I’ll probably switch to the new taxonomy if that remains your preference though.</p>
<h2 id="cricetidae-arvicolinae">Cricetidae: Arvicolinae</h2>
<h3 id="anteliomys-custos-changshanensis--"><em>Anteliomys custos c(h)angs(h)anensis</em> (-)</h3>
<p>I noticed that for this Chinese vole I have <em>cangshanensis</em>, MDD has <em>changshanensis</em>, and the Krystufek book has <em>changsanensis</em>. I haven’t seen the original description, but MSW 3 uses <em>cangshanensis</em> and according to Krystufek the type locality is “Dali Cangshan”, so I think that is most likely correct.</p>
<h3 id="myodesclethrionomys"><em>Myodes</em>/<em>Clethrionomys</em> (+)</h3>
<p>Probably the most intractable purely nomenclatural disagreement in mammals. I am going to accept the current emerging consensus and switch to <em>Clethrionomys</em>, but I have discovered several type designations in the 19th-century literature that are relevant to this controversy and I am going to try to publish about it.</p>

<h3 id="chionomys-syriacus-mdd-vs.-c.-nivalis-hesp--"><em>Chionomys syriacus</em> (MDD) vs. <em>C. nivalis</em> (Hesp) (-!)</h3>
<p>The name <em>syriacus</em> was recently discovered to be a senior synonym of <em>nivalis</em>. However, there is a pending petition to the Commission to conserve the junior name (Case 3859; receipt acknowledged <a href="https://bioone.org/journals/the-bulletin-of-zoological-nomenclature/volume-78/issue-3/bzn.v78.a042/Notice-of-New-Applications-to-the-Commission-Case-38583862/10.21805/bzn.v78.a042.full">in the BZN</a>). Under Article 82 of the Code, prevailing usage should be maintained until the application is resolved. <em>Chionomys nivalis</em> is clearly in prevailing usage, so I would strongly recommend that MDD switch back to using <em>nivalis</em>.</p>
<h2 id="cricetidae-neotominae">Cricetidae: Neotominae</h2>
<h3 id="neotoma-nelsoni"><em>Neotoma nelsoni</em> (+)</h3>
<p>MDD recognizes <em>Neotoma nelsoni</em> as a species; I have it as a synony of <em>Neotoma leucodon</em> based on Fernández (2014), who found it to be nested genetically within <em>N. leucodon</em>. However, Bradley et al. (2022) found some conflicting evidence and recommended that <em>nelsoni</em> be kept as a species provisionally, so I’ll put it back for now. I haven’t tracked down where all of Bradley’s material comes from (they give specimen numbers but not localities), but it sounds like their material did not cover the whole range of <em>Neotoma leucodon</em> and the species may not be monophyletic.</p>

<h3 id="peromyscus-arcticus--"><em>Peromyscus arcticus</em> (-)</h3>
<p>MDD recognizes the distinctive <em>Peromyscus</em> species from Yukon as <em>Peromyscus arcticus</em> but acknowledges in comments that the name may not be applicable. I agree that this population likely represents a separate species, but I believe it has no available name, so it should not be included in the database until someone names it. Bradley et al. (2019) also refer to this form as “<em>Peromyscus</em> sp.” only.</p>
<p>Greenbaum et al. (2019:564) attribute the name <em>arcticus</em> to Wagner (1845), apparently in error; Wagner (1845) in fact named <em>Peromyscus maniculatus</em>. The name <em>arcticus</em> instead first appears in Coues (1877), as <em>articus</em> on p. 61 and <em>arcticus</em> on p. 67; Coues cited a name found on the label for specimen USNM 3924 from Labrador. He didn’t treat the name as valid and identified the specimen as <em>Hesperomys leucopus</em>. Next Mearns (1890) named <em>Hesperomys leucopus arcticus</em> for a specimen from Mackenzie in the Northwest Territories. Later Mearns (1911) recognized his <em>arcticus</em> as a junior homonym of Coues’s <em>arcticus</em>, and therefore replaced it with <em>borealis</em>. This is important because Coues’s name by default would be unavailable because it was published as a synonym, but ICZN Art. 11.6.1 states that if such a name is treated as a senior homonym before 1961, it becomes available as of its first publication as a synonym. Therefore, <em>arcticus</em> Coues, 1877, is an available name.</p>
<p>But <em>arcticus</em> Coues is from Labrador, within the range of <em>Peromyscus maniculatus</em> <em>sensu stricto</em>, so it is clearly not available for the Yukon form. Instead, <em>borealis</em> Mearns could be an available name for this species, but according to Bradley et al. (2019:28), its type locality is within the range of <em>Peromyscus sonoriensis</em>, not the Yukon <em>Peromyscus</em>. (They cite the type locality as “Fort Simpson, Yukon Territory”, which is incorrect; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Simpson">Fort Simpson</a> is in the Northwest Territories.)</p>

<h3 id="peromyscus-totontepecus"><em>Peromyscus totontepecus</em></h3>
<p>I accept the split of this species from <em>Peromyscus mexicanus</em>, but it appears the species should actually be called <em>P. tehuantepecus</em>. Both names were published in the same paper (Merriam, 1898): <em>Peromyscus mexicanus totontepecus</em> Merriam, 1898:120 and <em>Peromyscus tehuantepecus</em> Merriam, 1898:122. The Code specifies (Art. 24.1) that if two names are published simultanteously but with different ranks, the one with higher rank has precedence. Since <em>tehuantepecus</em> was established as a species and <em>totontepecus</em> as a subspecies, <em>tehuantepecus</em> has priority. I am going to recognize the species as <em>Peromyscus tehuantepecus</em>.</p>

<h3 id="hylaeamys-laticeps-and-h.-seuanezi--"><em>Hylaeamys laticeps</em> and <em>H. seuanezi</em> (-)</h3>
<p>MDD recognizes <em>Hylaeamys laticeps</em> as valid with <em>seuanezi</em> as a synonym; I recognize <em>seuanezi</em> as valid.</p>
<p>There are two uncontested species involved here, <em>Hylaeamys megacephalus</em> in the Cerrado and other open habitats, and <em>Hylaeamys seuanezi</em> in the Atlantic Forest. The type locality of <em>H. laticeps</em> is in a transitional zone between the Cerrado and the Atlantic Forest, so the issue is whether it is a junior synonym of <em>megacephalus</em> or a senior synonym of <em>seuanezi</em>. Brennand et al. (2013) (which I peer reviewed) examined the type material of <em>laticeps</em> and found that morphometrically it falls within <em>H. megacephalus</em>. I don’t see anything in the comments or references in MDD that casts serious doubt on that conclusion.</p>
<h3 id="phyllotis-rupestris--"><em>Phyllotis rupestris</em> (-)</h3>
<p>This is a similar situation to <em>Peromyscus arcticus</em>, where there is good evidence for a split but the name of the newly recognized species is uncertain. In this case, the cited sources do not explicitly recognize a species <em>Phyllotis rupestris</em>; they call it the “clade of <em>P. x. posticalis-P. x. rupestris</em>” (Jayat et al., 2021:701; Ojeda et al., 2021:277). As discussed by Jayat et al. (2021:704), the type of <em>rupestris</em> is lost but the name may actually represent <em>P. limatus</em> or <em>P. vaccarum</em>. Given this uncertainty, I will maintain the previous classification and keep this name in <em>P. xanthopygus</em>.</p>

<h3 id="dendromus-melanotis-mdd-vs.-poemys-melanotis-hesp--"><em>Dendromus melanotis</em> (MDD) vs. <em>Poemys melanotis</em> (Hesp) (-)</h3>
<p><em>Dendromus melanotis</em> is the type species of <em>Poemys</em>, so if <em>Poemys</em> is to be recognized as a valid genus, <em>melanotis</em> must be included. From reading Voelker et al. (2021), it seems that various names that have previously been assigned to <em>melanotis</em> are in the <em>Poemys</em> clade, but there’s no genetic evidence for <em>melanotis</em> itself. It doesn’t seem unreasonable then to place <em>melanotis</em> in <em>Poemys</em> along with its presumed close relatives. Alternatively, <em>Poemys</em> could be subsumed back into <em>Dendromus</em> pending a more thorough taxonomic revision.</p>
<p>I ran a script to compare Hesperomys against the latest release of the MDD: https://gist.github.com/JelleZijlstra/0bb7845fdf451ebaffe7878ee140fd21. There’s a lot of harmless small differences (e.g., different transcriptions of Russian names), and also a lot of cases where my database is wrong, so I have some more work to do to get the list down to something more manageable.</p>
<p>However, here are a few things I noticed where MDD seems incorrect:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Myotis gomantongensis</em>: MDD gives the authority as “J. Edwards Hill &amp; Francis”, but the article is by Francis &amp; Hill (in that order) and I don’t see anything in the text to suggest the species should use a different authority order</li>
<li><em>Hipposideros kunzi</em>: MDD has one of the authors as “Zubaib”, should be “Zubaid”</li>
<li><em>Macronycteris cryptovalorona</em>: author “Willos-Munro” should be “Willows-Munro”</li>
<li><em>Cacajao ucayalii</em>: MDD has an extra comma after the authority</li>
<li><em>Microcebus griseorufus</em>: author should be “Kollmann”, not “Kollman”</li>
<li><em>Microcebus macarthurii</em>: MDD cuts off the last few authors, should be “Radespiel, Olivieri, Rasolofoson, Rakotondratsimba, Rakotonirainy, Rasoloharijaona, Randrianambinina, Ratsimbazafy, Ratelolahy, Randriamboavonjy, Rasolofoharivelo, Craul, Rakotozafy &amp; Randrianarison”</li>
<li><em>Mesomys leniceps</em>: author should be O. Thomas &amp; St. Leger, not just O. Thomas as MDD currently says (<em>Thomasomys rosalinda</em> was named in the same paper and MDD does have both names there)</li>
<li><em>Cuniculus taczanowskii</em>: author should be “Stolzmann” not “Stolzman”</li>
<li><em>Phyllomys blainvilii</em>: author should be “Jourdan” not “Jordan”</li>
<li><em>Acomys muzei</em> and <em>Acomys ngurui</em> authors should be “W. N. Verheyen, Hulselmans, Wendelen, Leirs, Corti, Backeljau &amp; E. Verheyen” (MDD is currently missing the last few)</li>
<li><em>Meriones hurrianae</em>: author should be “Jerdon” not “Jordon” (though I haven’t confirmed against the original description)</li>
<li><em>Apomys lubangensis</em> and <em>Apomys iridensis</em>: third author should be “Veluz” not “Veluz”</li>
<li><em>Hylomyscus mpungamachagorum</em>: authority should be “Demos, Hutterer &amp; Kerbis Peterhans” (MDD reverses the order)</li>
<li><em>Maxomys tajuddinii</em>: last author should be “Maharadatunkamsi”, not “Maharadantunkamsi” as in MDD</li>
<li><em>Rattus detentus</em>: authors should be just “Timm, Weijola, K. P. Aplin, Flannery, and Pine” (the paper had a few more authors, but these are listed explicitly as the authors of the name)</li>
</ul>
<p>Original name - <em>Marmosops pakaraimae</em>: original name should be <em>pakaraimae</em> not <em>pakaraime</em> - <em>Thylamys velutinus</em>: original combination should be <em>Didelphys velutina</em> not <em>Marmosa</em> - <em>Dasyurus albopunctatus</em>: original combination should be <em>Dasyurus albopunctatus</em> not <em>Dasyuroides</em> - <em>Dasyurus viverrinus</em>: original combination should be <em>Didelphis VIverrina</em> not <em>viverrinus</em> - <em>Microperoryctes murina</em>, <em>Microperoryctes aplini</em>, <em>Peroryctes papuensis</em>: MDD has a typo in the original name combination (“oyctes”) - <em>Chiropotes utahicki</em>: MDD has <em>satanus</em> instead of <em>satanas</em> in the original combination - <em>Dactylomys boliviensis</em>: MDD has “bolviensis” in the original combination instead of <em>boliviensis</em> - <em>Spermophilus perotensis</em>: MDD incorrectly has “Spermophlus” in the original combination - <em>Thamnomys venustus schoutedeni</em>: MDD incorrectly has “Thamnonmys” in the original combination</p>
<p>Type specimen - <em>Marmosa simonsi</em>: type should be 99.8.1.20 not 98.8.1.20 - <em>Monodelphis pinocchio</em>: holotype is in MN (Museo Nacional), not AMNH - <em>Murexia rothschildi</em>: type should be BMNH 1939.3233 (fide Van Dyck 2000), not AMNH 108106 which is the paratype - <em>Crocidura panayensis</em>: collection code should be ZFMK not ZMFK (it stands for <em>Z</em>oologisches <em>F</em>orschungs-<em>M</em>useum Alexander <em>K</em>önig). A number of other names have the same issue. - <em>Surdisorex polulus</em>: type should be USNM 163992, not 163922 (I checked the USNM database and 163922 is a <em>Procavia</em>) - <em>Alces alces</em>: MDD lists ROM 20068 as the type, but this is in fact the type of the nominal subspecies <em>Alces americana andersoni</em> R.L. Peterson, 1950.</p>
<p>There’s a lot more I haven’t looked at in depth yet. These are mostly very nitpicky issues, so let me know if you’d rather I don’t file these. I compared the higher classification (above the genus level) in MDD to my classification, mostly in order to find additional places where my classification is out of date. There were surprisingly many differences (6892, more than one per species on average), though many are explained by just a few underlying disagreements. For example, we use different names for the two suborders of bats. However, with some changes I made in my database, there is only one remaining difference at the level of order or family (Sicistidae vs. Sminthidae); all other differences affect only other ranks.</p>
<p>A common theme is that my classification adds additional levels that are only important for fossils. For example, within Proboscidea MDD recognizes one family Elephantidae and two genera <em>Elephas</em> and <em>Loxodonta</em>. I add suborder Elephantiformes, infraorder Elephantimorpha, subfamily Elephantinae, and tribes Elephantini and Loxodontini, which are useful because my classification also covers fossils, but they add little information to a classification that only covers extant mammals, so there’s little reason for MDD to adopt them.</p>
<p>There are many other differences that I haven’t fully looked into yet, including many cases where I add additional levels MDD doesn’t recognize, and also many cases where we simply follow different classifications. The full list of differences, sorted into categories, is at https://gist.github.com/JelleZijlstra/da80f473e5f8ffa383bbcbc15ac20f7b.</p>
<p>I want to share two categories of differences: a few where I would recommend that the MDD make a change now, and a slightly larger group of purely nomenclatural differences that I should probably publish a paper about.</p>

<p>I’ll use this thread to list places where I think MDD should change an author citation. My script currently finds 300 author differences, but I’ll probably be able to get rid of a few more as I go through them in detail.</p>
<p>Note that the lists below include all the names that I tried based on the data in my database; they also include the MDD species number.</p>
<p>Some of these are pretty nitpicky issues, so sorry for that! However, being consistent will make it easier to cross-reference our databases in the future.</p>

<p>Listing here cases where we actually have different authors, not just different ways to express the same author’s name:</p>

<li>Desmarest (1 differences)
<ul>
<li>Desmarest (MDD) vs. Henri-Marie Ducrotay de Blainville (1777–1850; French zoologist; checked; french) (tried: Blainville, H.-M. D. Blainville, H.-M. Blainville, H. Ducrotay Blainville, de Blainville, H.-M. D. de Blainville, H.-M. de Blainville, H.

<li>This article is by Blainville. Desmarest also mentioned this species in 1816, but he refers to the Blainville paper by page, so that must have been published earlier. p. 192 in Desmarest, A.G. 1816. ANTILOPE, <em>Antilope</em>. Pp. 178–208 in Anonymous (eds.). Nouveau dictionnaire d’histoire naturelle. Nouvelle Édition. Tome II. Deterville, 592 pp.</li>

<li>The Zimmermann 1780 version of this name was rejected by the Commission. International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. 1957. Direction 79. Substitution on the Official List of Specific Names in Zoology of the specific name <em>brasiliensis</em> Gmelin (J.F.), 1788, as published in the combination <em>Mustela lutris</em> var. <em>brasiliensis</em>, for the specific name <em>sambachii</em> Gray (J.E.), 1837, as published in the combination <em>Pteronura sambachii</em> (Class Mammalia) (Direction supplementary to Opinion 384).

<ul>
<li>E. T. Bennett (MDD) vs. Juan Ignacio Molina (1740–1829; Chilean naturalist; checked; spanish) (tried: Molina, J. I. Molina, J. Molina, J.

<li>I’m going against most of the recent literature here, but it seems Molina’s name was indeed based on a chinchilla, and if so it is the oldest name for the species.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Erxleben (1 differences)
<ul>
<li>Erxleben (MDD) vs. Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber (1739–1810; German naturalist; checked; german) (tried: Schreber, J. C. D. Schreber, J. Schreber, von Schreber, J. C.

<li>Discovered this while going over Schreber’s book: his plate of <em>Mustela Foina</em> predates Erxleben’s book. Indeed, Erxleben’s synonymy lists Schreber’s plate, confirming that it was published later.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>F. Cuvier (1 differences)
<ul>
<li>F. Cuvier (MDD) vs. Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (1805–1861; French naturalist; checked; general) (tried: Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, I.

<li>Brongniart (1792) as the author of this name follows: Hershkovitz, P. 1959. Nomenclature and taxonomy of the Neotropical mammals described by Olfers, 1818. Journal of Mammalogy 40(3):337-353. JSTOR 1376558</li>

<li>With Brazilian names it’s often hard to figure out where the family name starts. The email address listed for this author on the paper is “mariliakerr@”, so I assume “Kerr” is part of her family name not her given name.</li>

<li>Spelled “Barriere” on this paper, but you have him as “Barrière” on <em>Congosorex verheyeni</em> and <em>Sylvisorex akaibei</em>, so let’s use that spelling consistently</li>

<p>(To be continued) Hey <span class="citation" data-cites="jts1882">@jts1882</span> this is awesome, thanks for your contributions – super sorry that I am slow to integrate this. It was a crazy semester and your input coincided with my teaching starting in Feb. Merging now and let’s see what breaks vs. still works. Thanks again, –n Re: https://github.com/mammaldiversity/mammaldiversity.github.io/issues/24</p>
<p>I’ve made changes to filter.js to handle different url hash components on the explore page.</p>
<p>The new version parses the hash component to extract parameters (genus, species, id, etc) and then uses the id to show the speciesinfo or if that is unavailable uses the genus+species parameters. The latter should make iNaturalist links work.</p>
<p>Warning. Because my fork is in a directory (/mdd/) rather than the root, I’ve had to change the paths in a number of files to get my fork functioning (i.e. change “/js/filter.js” to “js/filter.js”). I think these links should work when the code is in the root as on mammaldiversity.org. All the relevant changes for the permalink issue are in filter.js</p>

<p><em>Comments</em>: As we discussed at ASM, GitHub issues could be a good way to bring up new papers or other suggested changes to the MDD. I’ll try this out for this paper and maybe some others I come across. If we like this format, we can set up some issue templates to make it easier to open the issue and standardize the format.</p>
<p>Now on to comments on the paper itself. This paper proposes recognizing the subspecies <em>Eptesicus fuscus miradorensis</em> as a species. I am not convinced, and in my database I plan to keep it as a subspecies for now (I’ll make it a species if MDD decides to accept it). Ramírez-Chaves et al. (2023) use only mtDNA (Cytb and COI). <em>E. f. miradorensis</em> is sister to all of <em>E. fuscus</em> in the Cytb tree, but sister to just <em>E. f. pallidus</em> (western USA) in the COI tree. Yi &amp; Latch (2022) also studied nuclear DNA and found a complex pattern of isolation and gene flow, but no especially distinctive position for <em>E. f. miradorensis</em>. Possibly more of the subspecies should be recognized as species, but to me the evidence looks more like a single species with a complex pattern of regional divergence. Addressed with commit 8cdf45784c17b54b51aff0920f1d584cd6895e7a Added json endpoint with commit 7fa08b3ae25bf78ba0da4ab4dc97a97d629dc9c7 Thank you for the resources and advice <span class="citation" data-cites="jhpoelen">@jhpoelen</span>.</p>
<p>My understanding of the motivation for revamping the site is to do exactly as you say and keep it as simple as possible so that it is maintainable into the future as others work on it. So I think doing our best to stick the html, css, and javascript to create a streamlined and static site is a good idea.</p>
<p>Man, there are a lot of libraries out there and it is very intimidating. Right now I am trying to figure out how to structure the site so that everything will work correctly. You had mentioned that you think keeping the database just as a csv is the easiest thing to maintain in to the future so I am figuring out how to search it. There is csv parse on npm and then papa parse seems fairly popular. If I can figure out how to integrate the parsers to populate fields (like an infographic when hovering or something) on the fly using javascript instead of having each species given their own dedicated page I think that will make it easier to keep everything simple and maintainable moving forward. That way the actual csv can change as much as it wants and be updated without having to generate or change a bunch of pages. But I could be wrong with my thinking there.</p>
<p>Thanks again for the resources. <span class="citation" data-cites="liphardt">@liphardt</span> great to hear that you are looking around for existing libraries to implement a basic search.</p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind is that a web page with statically inserted taxonomic information can be searched using selectors, effectively turning a webpage into a searchable dynamic document/database.</p>
<p>So, if you embed the taxonomic information tag attributes (e.g., <code>&lt;div class="Animalia Mammalia Homo sapiens"&gt;</code>), you can use the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/querySelector with javascript or css selectors to implement some fancy looking show/hide/search behavior.</p>
<p>Luckily you probably won’t be the first to implement this behavior, because html/css/javascript/dom are widely used.</p>
<p>Good luck with the search and implementation! I am curious to see what you’ll come up with. Thanks <span class="citation" data-cites="jhpoelen">@jhpoelen</span> and <span class="citation" data-cites="liphardt">@liphardt</span> for the comments here – I’m on board with everything you both have written here. Schuyler demo’ed today some of the code he has been playing with and it looks good: fast, in browser searching using html tags, and starting to consider some javascript options. My only feedback for now is to push &amp; commit those changes more regularly, so that Jorrit can give feedback if / when appropriate. Thanks both! This is an with the BOM at the beginning of a UTF encoded CSV messing with how Ruby (Liquid) is parsing the first column. We temporarily fixed this by adding a blank first column. Leaving the issue open until a more permanent fix. Readme updated to reflect that you cannot have a BOM with 349b661906b392c8fdb29f069475145568bed761 Looks good! I resolved this issue with commit cd8ddb54c7f1f191b6c23ea7ccb05a258e5d923d.

<p>Hi <span class="citation" data-cites="jts1882">@jts1882</span> – thanks for this helpful suggestion. It’s a good idea to enable direct links to higher-level taxonomic views on the MDD taxonomy. I’ll copy <span class="citation" data-cites="liphardt">@liphardt</span> here to flag this as a priority area for work. It would be excellent to have MDD-curated information flowing more readily into Wikipedia pages. Cheers. I’ve finally worked out how to use github* and have made the appropriate changes in my fork of the project.</p>
<p>Use search parameter on the search species page to initialise the “filter” text in the search box:</p>
<ul>
<li>List of cats in genus <em>Felis</em>: https://jts1882.github.io/mdd/explore.html#search=Felis</li>
</ul>
<p>Use order, family and genus parameters to initialize state on taxonomy page.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use order parameter to expand order content (show families): https://jts1882.github.io/mdd/taxa.html#order=Carnivora</li>
<li>Use family parameter to expand family content (show genera): https://jts1882.github.io/mdd/taxa.html#family=Felidae</li>
<li>Use genus parameter to expand genus content (show species): https://jts1882.github.io/mdd/taxa.html#genus=Felis</li>
</ul>
<p>This is mainly done by adding new functions. The exceptions are a modification of goPermalink() to handle seeding the search box and addition of a single line to call the function that expands the content at the end of the complete block in createOrderTable(), fillFamily() and fillGenus().</p>
<p>The new functions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>parseURLforParameters() - gets the parameters from the url</li>
<li>initializeOrderExpansion() - expands the order to show families; called at the end of createOrderTable()</li>
<li>initializeFamilyExpansion() - expands the family to show genera; called at the end of fillFamily()</li>
<li>initializeGenusExpansion() - expands the genus to show species; called at the end of fillGenus()</li>
<li>expandTaxon() - expands the list by creating a click event for the appropriate button, which then initiates fillFamily(), fillGenus() or fillSpecies()</li>
<li>getParentTaxon() - gets higher taxa for families and genera so they can be expanded. You need to expand the order before expanding the family and expanding the genus needs both order and family expanded</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don’t use any parameters, nothing should be different.</p>
<p>_* The main problem getting the fork to work was format of the internal urls. Links such as “/assets/data/mdd.csv” or “/js/filter.js” don’t work in the fork and need the leading slash removed (i.e. “assets/data/mdd.csv” or “js/filter.js”). I don’t think the slash is needed in the master project. This is really great <span class="citation" data-cites="jts1882">@jts1882</span> – thanks for your effort in adding this functionality on your fork of the project. Sorry it took a while for our team to get back to this. I’m looking at your code now, and it seems that the main new functions are here (https://github.com/jts1882/mdd/blob/master/js/mammals.js) – is that right?</p>
<p>If you can point out which files we’d need to edit, we can add this functionality straight away to the MDD main page. Cheers I’ve updated mammals.js to my latest version, with the treeview and automatic opening of either the taxonomy table or the treeview.</p>
<p>https://jts1882.github.io/mdd/taxa.html#family=Felidae</p>
<p>https://jts1882.github.io/mdd/tree.html?genus=Felis</p>
<p>In addition, the following files are added or modified:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To get the automated opening of the table in explore taxonomy (taxa.md) I had to make some changes to filter.js, adding the functions to expand the tree and modifying the existing functions to call these functions, I also split one function so I could call part of it separately (to display the info in treeview).</p></li>

<p>Thanks <span class="citation" data-cites="jhpoelen">@jhpoelen</span> – this is awesome! Great to have the USNM links in the database; we’ll work on making the hyperlinks now too One way to help support this search functionality is to pre-render json files( using some jekyll template) that are organized by key-value - where key is the search term and value is a list of search results (or ids that point to same result).</p>
<p>Each of the search terms would have their own dedicated json file e.g., index-country.json, index-status.json, index-common-names.json</p>
<p>Then, in the search tool, the various indexes can be used to help narrow down the search results given the user’s interest.</p>

<h3 id="chrysospalax-villosa-vs.-villosus--"><em>Chrysospalax villosa</em> vs. <em>villosus</em> (-)</h3>
<p>MDD has <em>villosus</em>, I have <em>villosa</em>.</p>
<p>My notes on the name complex say: “From σπάλαξ spalax”mole-rat, spalacid“. LSJ claims the word is feminine, sometimes masculine. The variant ἀσπάλαξ aspalax is masculine. In practice, -spalax names are treated as masculine.” (e.g., <em>Spalax graecus</em>)</p>
<p>Gill’s original description of the name talks about “<em>C. villosa</em>”, but the <em>C.</em> stands for <em>Chrysochloris</em>, not <em>Chrysospalax</em>, as Gill named the taxon as a “section” of <em>Chrysochloris</em>.</p>
<p>AI: Confirm this specific epithet change; I think there’s room for disagreement.</p>

<h2 id="bovidae">Bovidae</h2>
<h3 id="bos-domesticus-and-banteng--"><em>Bos domesticus</em> and <em>banteng</em> (-)</h3>
<p>MDD recognizes <em>domesticus</em> as a separate species for the domestic banteng. Possibly more consistent, but this species isn’t generally recognized in my experience. Gentry et al. (2004) do not discuss the banteng.</p>
<p>MDD attributes the name <em>domesticus</em> to Wilckens, 1905. I instead have <em>Bos banteng domesticus</em> Duerst, 1905, as a nomen nudum. This book is here: https://www.google.com/books/edition/Grundz%C3%BCge_der_Naturgeschichte_der_Haust/JWDZAAAAMAAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=Grundz%C3%BCge+der+Naturgeschichte+der+Haustiere&amp;printsec=frontcover</p>
<p>The book is a reworking by Duerst of a previous book by Wilckens, who was dead by the time it was published. In the foreword, Duerst explicitly says that he completely redid the section on cattle (p. iv). So I think the name should indeed be attributed to Duerst, not Wilckens. Whether or not <em>domesticus</em> Duerst is a nomen nudum is more debatable. The citation on p. 245 is very barebones (“Bos Banteng domesticus, das zahme Bantengrind”), but there is some more discussion of bantengs on pp. 239-242. However, I don’t see any characters cited that are supposed to distinguish domesticated from wild bantengs.</p>
<p>MDD says <em>domesticus</em> is preoccupied but there is no other alternative name. According to my notes the name <em>seleniceros</em> Heller, 1890, may have been based on a domestic banteng; it came from Timor where wild bantengs do not occur. Unfortunately I haven’t been able to locate the original description. I did dig up the original description of <em>seligniceros</em> Meyer, 1879 (not 1878), a nomen nudum also based on a specimen from Timor (perhaps the same one?).</p>
<p>AI:</p>
<ul>
<li>Figure out nomenclature for <em>domesticus</em>.</li>
<li>Confirm whether <em>seleniceros</em> is available for the domestic banteng.</li>
<li>In Hesp, consider recognizing domestic bantengs at the subspecies level at least.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bos-indicus-b.-primigenius-b.-taurus--"><em>Bos indicus</em>, <em>B. primigenius</em>, <em>B. taurus</em> (-)</h3>
<p><em>B. primigenius</em> was omitted from the list I sent only because it is extinct. I recognize it as valid.</p>
<p>MDD recognizes <em>Bos indicus</em> and <em>Bos taurus</em> as separate domestic species, based on Gentry et al. (2004). I have them as subspecies of <em>Bos taurus</em>.</p>
<p>This is mostly a philosophical disagreement, and I don’t think there’s been much discussion in the literature. I currently recognize the wild ancestors of the zebu and taurine cattle as the same species, <em>Bos primigenius</em>, so I think it makes sense to recognize a single domestic species. It’s true that there are two independent domestications, but that appears to be true for several other domestic species too (e.g. pigs) and splitting them up isn’t practical.</p>
<p>AI: Come to an agreement on how to handle this case.</p>
<h3 id="budorcas-tibetana"><em>Budorcas tibetana</em> (+)</h3>
<p>New split in MDD. I hadn’t seen the main cited source and I’ll accept the split.</p>
<p>MDD also cites Groves &amp; Grubb’s <em>Ungulate Taxonomy</em> but generally rejects their taxonomy. I have done the same thing because I felt they needed some incubation to know if they’d be accepted. Indeed, in this case G&amp;G recognize four takin species, but we ended up with only two.</p>
<p>Nomenclature: I had the specific epithet as <em>tibetanus</em>, but I misread a dictionary entry and the Greek word δορκάς is actually feminine. The spelling <em>tibetana</em> is correct.</p>
<h3 id="capra-caucasica-vs.-cylindricornis--"><em>Capra caucasica</em> vs. <em>cylindricornis</em> (-)</h3>
<p>MDD recognizes <em>Capra cylindricornis</em> as a separate species, I have it as a subspecies.</p>
<p>I hadn’t seen the cited source (Weinberg et al., 2010). However, it actually suggests naming the two species <em>cylindricornis</em> and <em>severtzovi</em>, because <em>caucasica</em> is supposedly based on a hybrid. They also don’t even sound very convinced that there are really two species. Given this uncertainty and the absence of genetic evidence, I would prefer to stick to one species.</p>
<p>Minor: MDD has a typo in the journal name (should be <em>Galemys</em>, not <em>Galemy</em>). The original spelling of <em>severtzovi</em> is <em>severtzowi</em>; I’ll list <em>severtzovi</em> as an incorrect subsequent spelling for now.</p>
<h3 id="cephalophus-vs.-cephalophorus-and-cephalophula--"><em>Cephalophus</em> vs. <em>Cephalophorus</em> and <em>Cephalophula</em> (-)</h3>
<p>MDD recognizes <em>Cephalophorus</em> (and <em>Cephalophula</em>) as a separate genus; I don’t.</p>
<p>The cited source (Bärmann et al., 2022) is a mtDNA-only study that doesn’t fully resolve the relationships among cephalophines, but <em>Cephalophus</em> is recovered as possibly paraphyletic relative to <em>Sylvicapra</em>. This seems a little marginal and I’m going to skip the generic rearrangement for now.</p>
<p>They also name <em>Leucocephalophus</em> as a new genus, with just barely enough to move it beyond being a nomen nudum. I will make it a subgenus for now.</p>
<h3 id="cephalophus-kivuensis--"><em>Cephalophus kivuensis</em> (-)</h3>
<p>MDD recognizes <em>C. kivuensis</em> as a separate species from “<em>C. nigrifrons</em>”; I don’t.</p>
<p>This is based on the same source. Their mtDNA tree (fig. 3) shows pretty much every other species in the group to be nonmonophyletic, suggesting that either mtDNA isn’t good at sorting out species here or a much more thorough reclassification is in order. They don’t specify where their samples of <em>nigrifrons</em> come from. There are various other available synonyms of <em>nigrifrons</em> from the eastern part of its distribution (e.g. <em>emini</em>). I would reject the change and wait for something more comprehensive.</p>
<h3 id="cephalophus-silvicultor-vs.-silvicultrix--"><em>Cephalophus silvicultor</em> vs. <em>silvicultrix</em> (-)</h3>
<p>MDD has the epithet as <em>silvicultor</em>, I have <em>silvicultrix</em>.</p>
<p>The original spelling (which I have seen) is <em>silvicultrix</em>. It was combined with the feminine name <em>Antilope</em>, but now it is in masculine <em>Cephalophus</em>.</p>
<p>This is a Latin noun meaning “female forest cultivator”. The masculine form would be <em>silvicultor</em>, but since the word is a noun, not an adjective, it does not change form based on the gender of the genus.</p>
<p>AI: Confirm this and publish it.</p>
<h3 id="eudorcas-rufina--"><em>Eudorcas rufina</em> (-)</h3>
<p>MDD lumps <em>rufinus</em>/<em>rufina</em> within <em>rufifrons</em> while I have it as valid.</p>
<p>MDD cites <em>Mammals of Africa</em> p. 357 for lumping the two. But the account there sounds more like the author is discussing a related extinct species in the account of another one, not that they are necessarily synonymizing them. The name isn’t listed as an explicit synonym or subspecies, and its range is not included in the range map for <em>rufifrons</em>. I would like to see more evidence before changing the classification.</p>
<p>Nomenclature: as with <em>Budorcas</em>, <em>Eudorcas</em> is feminine, so the -<em>us</em> names in my database are wrong and I will fix them.</p>
<h3 id="gazella-arabica-and-erlangeri"><em>Gazella arabica</em> and <em>erlangeri</em> (+)</h3>
<p>MDD reorganizes these species (enlarging <em>arabica</em> to include <em>erlangeri</em> and various subspecies of <em>gazella</em>), based on Bärmann et al. (2013), which I missed.</p>
<p>There is a discrepancy in the name of the form <em>darehshourii</em>, which MDD and Bärmann spell <em>dareshurii</em>. I did some digging but can’t quite confirm which spelling is right:</p>
<ul>
<li>The original description is at https://jsciences.ut.ac.ir/article_31396.html but the PDF link is broken</li>
<li>An archive of Groves’s old website is at https://web.archive.org/web/20130514055726/http://arts.anu.edu.au/grovco/Bovids.htm but the link to this paper is broken (it goes to his <em>Gazella bennettii</em> paper instead). However, text on the page spells the name <em>dareshurii</em>. It was named after “Mr Bijan Dareshuri, Biologist of Fars Province, Iran”.</li>
<li>In the 2001 Action Plan (https://portals.iucn.org/library/efiles/documents/2001-024.pdf) Groves contributed the piece on Iran and there the name is spelled <em>darehshourii</em> (p. 117).</li>
<li>MSW 3 also spelled it <em>darehshourii</em>.</li>
<li>The bibliography of Groves by Rookmaker &amp; Robovský (2018) spells it <em>darehshourii</em>.</li>
<li>Karami et al. (2002) use <em>dareshurii</em>. Ref: Karami, M., Hemami, M.R. and Groves, C.P. 2002. Taxonomic, distributional and ecological date on gazelles in Iran. Zoology in the Middle East 26:29-36.</li>
<li>Chiozzi et al. (2021) list the original description as being <em>darehshourii</em>, but cite Karami et al. (2002) as the first to use <em>dareshurii</em>. Ref: Chiozzi, G., De Marchi, G., Fasola, M., Ibrahim, K.M., Bardelli, G., Hagos, F., Rocca, F. and Masseti, M. 2021. Insular gazelles of the circum-Arabian seas: origin, distribution, dwarfism and taxonomy. Mammalian Biology 102(1):1-20. doi:10.1007/s42991-021-00186-3</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the above I think most likely the original spelling was <em>darehshourii</em> and Groves/the Iranians started changing it in 2002 (maybe Dareshuri let his preference about the spelling of his surname be known?). But that’s pure speculation until we have the original description. Either way, there’s enough of a disagreement here that we should publish a discussion of the spelling of this form.</p>
<p>AI: Confirm spelling of <em>dareshurii</em>.</p>
<h3 id="nanger-notataus-and-n.-petersii"><em>Nanger notata/us</em> and <em>N. petersii</em> (+)</h3>
<p>Two species split from <em>N. granti</em>; another similar situation and I will accept the split.</p>
<p>Spelling: MDD has <em>Nanger notatus</em>, I have the epithet as <em>notata</em>. I looked up the original description of <em>Nanger</em> by Lataste (1885) and can confirm the name is masculine, so <em>notatus</em> is right. Lorenzen et al. (2008) also use <em>notata</em> though.</p>
<h3 id="ovis"><em>Ovis</em> (+)</h3>
<p>MDD has <em>Ovis gmelini</em> and <em>O. vignei</em> as separate species; I lump them into <em>Ovis aries</em> with subspecies <em>aries</em> (domestic), <em>arkal</em>, and <em>cycloceros</em>. This is a big mess. I am going to follow your classification because clearly you have thought about this more, but below are some more notes.</p>
<p>My classification doesn’t make much sense here: I should put the wild and domestic forms in separate species for consistency, and I don’t know how I ended up with <em>cycloceros</em> when there are numerous older names synonymized under it.</p>
<p>MDD’s main cited source is Rezaei et al. (2010). They show good evidence for separate species <em>orientalis</em> (Turkey to Iran and introduced Mediterranean populations) and <em>vignei</em> (Iran to Pakistan and southern Central Asia). MDD rejects the name <em>orientalis</em> as based on a hybrid and uses the name <em>gmelini</em> for this species instead. MDD cites no source for the claim that <em>orientalis</em> is based on a hybrid. There is apparently a lectotype for <em>orientalis</em> in Moscow, so that can provide a way to resolve the question. MDD doesn’t state why the older name <em>musimon</em> Pallas, 1811, isn’t used over <em>gmelini</em> Blyth, 1841. However, the wild sheep of Sardinia are probably an ancient feral populations, so perhaps they should go into <em>aries</em>, just like dingos go into <em>Canis familiaris</em>.</p>
<p>The original spelling of <em>gmelini</em> Blyth, 1841, is actually <em>gmelinii</em>, though the form <em>gmelini</em> seems to be used more often. However, some recent authors also use <em>gmelinii</em>, so I would favor reverting to the original spelling. I wasn’t able to find any sources explicitly discussing this spelling. Its type locality is “Erzeroom” = Erzurum, eastern Turkey. A few sources I read claim that this is erroneous because wild sheep do not occur there, but at least the map in Rezaei et al. (2010) does show the species there.</p>
<p>The name <em>arabica</em> is in Oman, which doesn’t have sheep on the Rezaei et al. map, but I’ll trust you that it should go with <em>vignei</em>. The name <em>erskinei</em> is from somewhere in Iran; I’m putting it in <em>gmelini</em> but this needs confirmation. My database had both <em>isphaganica</em> and <em>isphahanica</em>; I looked up the original descriptions and concluded that <em>isphaganica</em> is the original spelling but <em>isphahanica</em> is a justified emendation by prevailing usage.</p>
<p>AI: - Establish the spelling of <em>gmelini</em>/<em>gmelinii</em>. - Establish whether <em>orientalis</em> is available.</p>
<h3 id="taurotragus-vs.-tragelaphus"><em>Taurotragus</em> vs. <em>Tragelaphus</em> (+)</h3>
<p>I recognize <em>Taurotragus</em> as distinct from <em>Tragelaphus</em>, MDD doesn’t.</p>
<p>Comments in MDD say that <em>Taurotragus</em> isn’t recognized because the Groves &amp; Grubb classification is generally rejected, but <em>Taurotragus</em> was recognized as a genus in Grubb (2005: p. 696, MSW3). However, Hassanin et al. (2018) show that <em>Tragelaphus</em> is paraphyletic relative to <em>Taurotragus</em>, so I will accept the synonymy.</p>
<p>You don’t recognize the genus <em>Ammelaphus</em> Heller, 1912, but it’s worth noting that <em>Strepsicerastes</em> Knottnerus-Meyer, 1903, appears to be an older name for this group (which is probably worthy of recognition as a subgenus). I haven’t seen the original publication to confirm this though.</p>
<p>AI: Consider publishing the <em>Ammelaphus</em>/<em>Strepsicerastes</em> situation.</p>
<h2 id="camelidae">Camelidae</h2>
<h3 id="lama-vs.-vicugna--"><em>Lama</em> vs. <em>Vicugna</em> (-)</h3>
<p>I have <em>Vicugna</em> as distinct; MDD lumps it under <em>Lama</em>.</p>
<p>The cited reason is low genetic distance. That’s probably fair, but I feel like a taxonomic database shouldn’t make such a change on its own initiative; it should be proposed in a peer-reviewed paper first.</p>
<h2 id="cervidae">Cervidae</h2>
<h3 id="elaphurusrusarucervus"><em>Elaphurus</em>/<em>Rusa</em>/<em>Rucervus</em> (+)</h3>
<p>MDD recognizes <em>Rusa</em> (4 species) and <em>Elaphurus</em> (1 species) as separate genera and puts the species <em>eldii</em> in <em>Rucervus</em>. I have them all as <em>Cervus</em>.</p>
<p>MDD’s cited source is Heckeberg (2020). Her molecular tree is on p. 23. The mtDNA tree aligns well with my classification (all genera are monophyletic), but the nDNA tree is quite different. In either case several of the genera in the MDD are nonmonophyletic.</p>
<p>I can’t remember what I based my generic classification on, and I can’t find a source that uses this classification. I am going to change to your/Heckeberg’s classification so at least I’m not making it up. To resolve Cervini into monophyletic genera we’re probably going to need a bigger nuclear dataset.</p>
<h3 id="muntiacus-muntjak-group"><em>Muntiacus muntjak</em> group (+)</h3>
<p>Here MDD recognizes three species based on genetic data: <em>M. malabaricus</em> in S India and Sri Lanka, <em>M. vaginalis</em> in most of India and mainland Southeast Asia, and <em>M. muntjak</em> in insular Southeast Asia/Sundaland. I recognize two species based on some of Groves’s work: <em>M. vaginalis</em> in South Asia and <em>M. muntjak</em> in SE Asia, both mainland and islands.</p>
<p>I don’t think my classification is tenable so I’m going to change to the MDD one, but want to highlight that the cited source (Martins et al., 2017) explicitly disclaims any taxonomic changes. A more conservative option would be to recognize all three as a single species, as in MSW 3.</p>
<p>Singh et al. (2021) recently recognized another species in this group, <em>Muntiacus aureus</em>. Should MDD follow suit? Ref: Singh, B., Kumar, A., Uniyal, V.P. and Gupta, S.K. 2021. Phylogeography and population genetic structure of red muntjacs: evidence of enigmatic Himalayan red muntjac from India. BMC Ecology and Evolution 21(1):1-15. doi:10.1186/s12862-021-01780-2</p>
<p>An interesting nomenclatural aspect is that <em>malabaricus</em> was named twice, under the same name, by Wroughton and Lydekker, both in 1915. Both databases attribute the name to Lydekker. The type specimen is said to be BMNH 13.8.22.133 by Lydekker and BMNH 13.8.22.103 by Wroughton but I suspect one of those is a typo and it’s the same specimen; MDD says the type is 13.8.22.103. The BMNH online catalog also has 103: https://data.nhm.ac.uk/dataset/collection-specimens/resource/05ff2255-c38a-40c9-b657-4ccb55ab2feb/record/3626309 As for the date, Wroughton’s name was published on 30 September 1915 according to the issue cover (in BHL). Lydekker (1915) doesn’t bear a precise date, but the preface is dated 19 April 1915. I suppose it was published not long after that.</p>
<p>AI: Confirm priority of descriptions for <em>malabaricus</em></p>
<h2 id="delphinidae">Delphinidae</h2>
<h3 id="globicephala-macrorhyncha-vs.-macrorhynchus--"><em>Globicephala macrorhyncha</em> vs. <em>macrorhynchus</em> (-)</h3>
<p>I have this species as <em>macrorhyncha</em>, MDD has <em>macrorhynchus</em>.</p>
<p>This hinges on whether the name is an adjective or a noun in apposition. It sounds like an adjective to me (“long-nosed”), but <em>macrorhynchus</em> is overwhelmingly more common in recent literature, and for names like this sometimes there’s a credible argument that the epithet is a noun.</p>
<p>AI: Figure out whether this has been discussed in the literature. MSW 3 only refers to Van Bree (1971).</p>
<h2 id="hippopotamidae">Hippopotamidae</h2>
<h3 id="malagasy-hippopotamus--">Malagasy <em>Hippopotamus</em> (-)</h3>
<p>MDD recognizes two species of extinct Malagasy <em>Hippopotamus</em>: <em>H. lemerlei</em> and <em>H. madagascariensis</em> (including <em>H. guldbergi</em>). I instead recognize <em>H. laloumena</em>, <em>H. guldbergi</em>, and <em>H. lemerlei</em>, the latter including <em>H. madagascariensis</em>.</p>
<p><em>H. laloumena</em> may have been excluded from MDD because it is supposed to be older.</p>
<p>This is a confusing situation but I reviewed it in some detail a few years ago and came to the conclusion that the literature indicates that the holotype of <em>H. madagascariensis</em> is indeed a <em>H. lemerlei</em>. See http://hesperomys.com/n/22965</p>

<h2 id="physeteridae">Physeteridae</h2>
<h3 id="physeter-catodon-vs.-macrocephalus"><em>Physeter catodon</em> vs. <em>macrocephalus</em> (+)</h3>
<p>MDD calls the sperm whale <em>P. macrocephalus</em> and I use <em>P. catodon</em>.</p>
<p>I reviewed Husson &amp; Holthuis (1974) and the argument for <em>macrocephalus</em> seems solid under the Code; I am making the change. I didn’t do it before because MSW 3 uses <em>catodon</em>, and there hasn’t been any published work (that I have seen) making a reasoned argument for change.</p>
<p>AI: Publish this discussion.</p>
<h2 id="suidae">Suidae</h2>
<h3 id="sus-domesticus-vs.-sus-scrofa--"><em>Sus domesticus</em> vs. <em>Sus scrofa</em> (-)</h3>
<p>This is the domestic pig. MDD recognizes it as a species; I don’t.</p>
<p>MDD is being consistent here, but there is little precedent for recognizing domestic pigs as a separate species, so I’m going to punt on this one.</p>
<h3 id="sus-bucculentus"><em>Sus bucculentus</em> (+)</h3>
<p>I recognize this species; MDD lumps it under <em>Sus scrofa</em>.</p>
<p>The main cited source in MDD is Robins et al. (2006). I don’t find that totally convincing, because it is based on mtDNA only and acknowledges that their result may be because of introgression. However, Meijaard &amp; Groves (2013) accepted <em>bucculentus</em> as a synonym of their “<em>Sus moupinensis</em>”, which included pigs from a big chunk of the range of <em>Sus scrofa</em>. If Groves doesn’t even believe in the species any more, that’s enough for me to accept the change. Reference:</p>

<h3 id="catagonus-vs.-parachoerus--"><em>Catagonus</em> vs. <em>Parachoerus</em> (-!)</h3>
<p>MDD places the Chacoan peccary in the genus <em>Catagonus</em>; I use <em>Parachoerus</em>.</p>
<p>This is based on Dutra et al. (2017), a phylogenetic analysis of Tayassuidae. They found that <em>C. wagneri</em> isn’t closely related to the type species of <em>Catagonus</em>, which is a Pleistocene fossil, and accordingly revalidated the genus <em>Parachoerus</em> Rusconi, 1930, for <em>wagneri</em> and another fossil species, <em>Parachoerus carlesi</em>.

<p>Thanks <span class="citation" data-cites="dghuckaby">@dghuckaby</span>, that’s very helpful!</p>
<p>You are right that <em>Rangifer</em> is another case where a case could be made for separating domestic and wild forms into separate species. <em>Oryctolagus cuniculus</em> might be another example.</p>
<p>Thanks for bringing up the <em>Bubalus</em> paper. They make a good case for separating two domestic species, but it appears they had little material for wild water buffalos. Presumably those should also be split into two species, but the paper defers that decision. I did not mention <em>Oryctolagus</em> and other non-artiodactyls because this conversation is about Artiodactyla. I also apologize for having to upload the papers twice. I somehow entangled them the first time I did it.</p>
<p>I assumed this program would save my work, if I wrote something and did not post it, but it did not. I then wrote it using another program and posted a pdf. Is there someway to write something here and save it for future editing? Hey <span class="citation" data-cites="dghuckaby">@dghuckaby</span>, the comments here on Github can be edited after they are posted, but likely it is better to compose them in a text editor or word processor if you think it will be a long comment that you need to save and come back to in order to finish. Thanks for engaging here Here is a paper you might want to cite, which has Indicine and Taurine Cattle as separate species but their ancestors in one. This Wikipedia article (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bos) does it also, with reservation, but it also puts the Banteng in with the Gaur and Gayal in <em>Bibos</em>, <a href="https://github.com/mammaldiversity/mammaldiversity.github.io/files/10832531/Pitt.et.al.Domestication.of.cattle.two.or.three.events.pdf">Pitt et al Domestication of cattle two or three events.pdf</a></p>
<p>Coming back here, I noticed there is still a discrepancy with <em>Madoqua hindei</em>. MDD recognizes it as valid citing <em>Mammals of Africa</em>, but in that book (p. 329) <em>hindei</em> is actually listed as a subspecies of <em>cavendishi</em>. I am currently following that classification. The IUCN recognizes the entire <em>kirkii</em> complex as one species still (https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/12670/50190709). <span class="citation" data-cites="n8upham">@n8upham</span> thanks for publicly sharing your notes.

<li><em>Leopardus fasciatus</em> is a senior synonym of <em>L. munoai</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="canidae">Canidae</h2>
<h3 id="canis-lycaon"><em>Canis lycaon</em> (+)</h3>
<p>MDD recognizes this species; I don’t. I have some misgivings about this because the cited source shows that <em>C. lycaon</em> are essentially just <em>C. lupus</em> with some hybrid coyote ancestry, but I’ll accept it.</p>
<h3 id="lycalopex-spelling--"><em>Lycalopex</em> spelling (-)</h3>
<p>I treat <em>Lycalopex</em> as feminine and consequently use the specific epithets <em>grisea</em>, <em>gymnocerca</em>, and <em>vetula</em>. MDD uses names in -<em>us</em> instead.</p>
<p><em>Lycalopex</em> derives from the Greek ἀλώπηξ alôpêx “fox”, which is feminine (<a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=alwphc&amp;la=greek#lexicon">LSJ</a>).</p>
<p>The specific epithets <em>griseus</em> (“gray”) and <em>vetulus</em> (“elderly”) are definitely adjectives, so they should change with the gender of the genus; <em>gymnocercus</em> (“naked-tailed”) could conceivably be interpreted as a noun in apposition instead to preserve the original form.</p>
<p>AI: Confirm the specific epithet changes are right and publish.</p>
<h2 id="herpestidae">Herpestidae</h2>
<h3 id="galerella-vs.-herpestes--"><em>Galerella</em> vs. <em>Herpestes</em> (-)</h3>
<p>MDD synonymizes <em>Galerella</em> under <em>Herpestes</em> based on an mtDNA study that found <em>Galerella</em> to be paraphyletic. The decision is probably right, but I would prefer to wait for a peer-reviewed reference that explicitly makes the suggestion.</p>
<h3 id="urva-spelling--"><em>Urva</em> spelling (+/-)</h3>
<p>Three differences:</p>
<ul>
<li>MDD <em>fusca</em> vs. Hesp <em>fuscus</em></li>
<li>MDD <em>javanica</em> vs. Hesp <em>javanicus</em></li>
<li>MDD <em>vitticolla</em> vs. Hesp <em>vitticollis</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The generic name is feminine, so in the first two Hesperomys is wrong and I will correct it.</p>
<p>However, <em>vitticollis</em> is a third-declension adjective and the feminine form is also <em>vitticollis</em>. <em>Urva vitticollis</em> is right.</p>
<h2 id="mustelidae">Mustelidae</h2>
<h3 id="ictonyx-vs.-poecilictis"><em>Ictonyx</em> vs. <em>Poecilictis</em> (+)</h3>
<p>I recognize <em>Poecilictis</em> as a genus; MDD includes it in <em>Ictonyx</em>. I may have done this because Koepfli et al. (2008) found <em>Ictonyx</em> to be paraphyletic, but that goes against my own admonition to avoid making changes that haven’t been explicitly proposed. I am synonymizing the two. Ref: Koepfli, K.-P., Deere, K.A., Slater, G.J., Begg, C., Begg, K., Grassman, L., Lucherini, M., Veron, G. and Wayne, R.K. 2008. Multigene phylogeny of the Mustelidae: Resolving relationships, tempo and biogeographic history of a mammalian adaptive radiation. BMC Biology 6(10):1-22. doi:10.1186/1741-7007-6-10</p>
<p>The spelling comment in MDD seems wrong: <em>libyca</em> is definitely an adjective, not a noun.</p>
<h3 id="lutra-and-related-genera"><em>Lutra</em> and related genera (+)</h3>
<p>MDD accepts a recent proposal to lump <em>Lutrogale</em>, <em>Amblonyx</em>, and <em>Aonyx</em> into <em>Lutra</em>. This is a rather invasive change. It creates at least two homonymies among fossil species (<em>robusta</em> and <em>indica</em>). There are a couple of fossil genera closely related to <em>Lutra</em> that perhaps should also be synonymized (<em>Algarolutra</em>, <em>Lutraeximia</em>, <em>Sardolutra</em>). However, I will accept the change as I like reducing the number of (nearly) monotypic genera.</p>
<h3 id="mustela-strigodorsa-vs.-strigidorsa"><em>Mustela strigodorsa</em> vs. <em>strigidorsa</em> (+)</h3>
<p>The original spelling is in fact <em>strigodorsa</em>, but virtually nobody has used that spelling since. The form <em>strigidorsa</em> can probably be declared a justified emendation through prevailing usage.</p>
<p>AI: Confirm this and publish it.</p>
<h2 id="phocidae">Phocidae</h2>
<h3 id="lobodon-carcinophaga-vs.-carcinophagus"><em>Lobodon carcinophaga</em> vs. <em>carcinophagus</em> (+)</h3>
<p>I have <em>carcinophagus</em> (interpreting the epithet as an adjective agreeing in gender with masculine <em>Lobodon</em>), MDD has <em>carcinophaga</em>, interpreting the name as a noun in apposition. Rice (1998) argued that it was a noun in apposition. I am skeptical this is what the original authors intended, but it’s not worth disturbing the established nomenclature, and I’ll switch to <em>carcinophaga</em>.</p>
<h2 id="viverridae">Viverridae</h2>
<h3 id="genetta-fieldiana-vs.-maculata--"><em>Genetta fieldiana</em> vs. <em>maculata</em> (-!)</h3>
<p>The name <em>Genetta maculata</em> was explicitly rejected by the ICZN because it was preoccupied by <em>Viverra maculata</em> Kerr = <em>Dasyurus maculatus</em>.</p>
<p>This was a rather complex nomenclatural situation, with a neotype designation and significant disagreement among authors who commented on the ICZN application. But the name <em>maculata</em> is definitely invalid, and <em>fieldiana</em> appears to be the oldest available name for the species, as Grubb (2004) called out.</p>
<p>Ref:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grubb, P. 2004. Comment on the proposed conservation of <em>Viverra maculata</em> Gray, 1830 (currently <em>Genetta maculata</em>; Mammalia, Carnivora). Bulletin of Zoological Nomenclature 61(2):119-122.</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="paradoxurus--"><em>Paradoxurus</em> (+/-)</h3>
<p>Three differences:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>MDD adds two species, <em>P. musangus</em> and <em>P. philippinensis</em></li>
<li>MDD uses the spelling <em>musangus</em>, I use <em>musanga</em> (for a subspecies at the moment)</li>
<li>MDD calls the Sri Lanka golden palm civet <em>zeylonensis</em>, I use <em>aureus</em></li>
</ol>
<p>I accept change (1) to add the two species recognized by Veron et al. (2014).</p>
<p>For (2), MDD comments say that <em>musanga</em> is an adjective and therefore should agree in gender with the species name. But it’s clearly not a classical Latin adjective. Raffles (1821), who named this species, writes that the Malay name of the animal is “Musang bulan”, so he must have slightly Latinized that name by adding -<em>a</em> to create the scientific name. The name sounds like a noun in apposition to me. The previous name on the page is <em>Viverra genetta</em>, another similar noun in apposition. (I wonder what he meant by that, as <em>Genetta</em> doesn’t occur on Sumatra. Maybe <em>Viverricula</em>?)</p>
<p>ADD: There is internal evidence that Raffles (1821) treated the name as a noun in apposition. In the rest of the paper, specific epithets are capitalized if they are based on a geographical term (e.g. <em>Mephitis Javanensis</em> p. 251) or are a noun in apposition (e.g. <em>Viverra Genetta</em> p. 252). Adjectival names are lowercase (e.g. <em>Tupaia ferruginea</em> p. 256). The specific epithet <em>musanga</em> is capitalized (<em>Viverra Musanga</em> p. 252). It’s not a geographical term, so he must have treated it as a noun in apposition.</p>
<p>For (3), I base myself on Groves et al. (2009, p. 249). Their main conclusion (that there are three species of golden palm civets on Sri Lanka) has been rejected, but I haven’t seen any reason to doubt their argument that the name <em>zeylonensis</em> was more likely based on a common palm civet (<em>P. hermaphroditus</em>), which also occurs on Sri Lanka. That leaves <em>aureus</em> as the oldest name for the golden palm civet.</p>
<p>I gave comments to this one over email that I’ll eventually add here, but it’s a bit of work to put it into a good commenting format, so give me a bit. I decided to look more into the <em>Nyctereutes viverrinus albus</em> situation. In summary, I don’t think there’s anything worth following up on at the moment.</p>
<p>The two different <em>albus</em> names in my database seem to be just because I uncritically added names from various lists. The two descriptions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hornaday, W.T. 1904-04-01. A new species of raccoon dog. Annual Report of the New York Zoological Society 8:71-73. https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/20493222</li>
<li>Beard, J.C. 1904-10-22. An animal new to science at the New York Zoological Park. Scientific American 91:287. https://books.google.nl/books?id=uYY3AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA287</li>
</ul>
<p>Both are based on the same specimen, a living animal in the New York zoo that was brought from Japan, acquired in Nagasaki but supposedly caught in the “northern portion of Japan”. Based on the dates on the works themselves, Hornaday’s description is unquestionably earlier. Hornaday is a formal description and Beard is a popular account in <em>Scientific American</em>. Nevertheless Beard (1904) is fairly regularly cited in the literature, maybe because it is easier to find than the zoo’s annual report.</p>
<p>The current classification in the Japanese literature recognizes subspecies <em>albus</em> from Hokkaido and subspecies <em>viverrinus</em> from the rest of Japan. The 1904 sources don’t even claim that the holotype came from Hokkaido; the “northern portion of Japan” could as well be northern Honshu. There is a specimen in the AMNH (AMNH 22792) with data that suggest it could be the holotype of <em>albus</em>, but Asahara (2016) found that it is not referable to the Hokkaido subspecies and probably isn’t the holotype.</p>
<p>Ref: Asahara, M. 2016. Provenance of a raccoon dog specimen from the New York Zoological Society in 1905. Departmental Bulletin Paper 1:23-28. https://mie-u.repo.nii.ac.jp/index.php?active_action=repository_view_main_item_detail&amp;page_id=13&amp;block_id=21&amp;item_id=6930&amp;item_no=1</p>
<p>This author cites Yoshiyuki (1988) which might have more discussion about this matter, but I can’t find it online. (Yoshiyuki M. (1988) Notes on the Yezo raccoon-dog, Nyctereutes procyonoides albus from Okushiri Island off Hokkaido, Japan. Memoirs of the National Science Museum 21: 189-197.)</p>
<p>Regardless, if this has already been considered in the literature, it seems fine to stick with the current classification. Hey <span class="citation" data-cites="jhpoelen">@jhpoelen</span> , yes that is correct – we used to have the former ID-only links working and resolving, but then we had a discussion with Scott Loarie of iNaturalist and they inquired about adding links in the format of <code>https://mammaldiversity.org/species-account.php?genus=[GENUS]&amp;species=[SPECIES]</code> in order to enable cross-linking with iNaturalist species pages.</p>
<p>We then tried for that, but didn’t quite get there as I recall, due to an issue that <span class="citation" data-cites="liphardt">@liphardt</span> discovered so we landed on the <code>https://www.mammaldiversity.org/explore.html#genus=[GENUS]&amp;species=[SPECIES]&amp;id=[ID]</code> format.</p>
<p>Do you think that having ID only would be better / easier in some way? The change has broken a lot of the links on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Why have three parameters when one would do? There is no harm having the genus and species parameters in addition to the id (if that is helpful for iNaturalist), but the id should be sufficient to get the page required, as it was before.</p>
<p>The best solution would be to set it up so the links resolve when using id alone or genus+species. Also it would be helpful to be backwards compatible in allowing id or species-id. It was to try to accommodate iNat so they could like to the MDD. I ran in to an issue where only having genus + species in the permalink pretty much broke everything else in the MDD since most of the code was written utilizing the id. <span class="citation" data-cites="n8upham">@n8upham</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="liphardt">@liphardt</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="jts1882">@jts1882</span> thanks for taking the time to respond.</p>
<p>In my experience, many taxonomic resources have a way to retrieve some kind of html landing page by id only. You’ll find many example of these at:</p>
<p>https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/blob/42c82ff03e15079cab2b38148963aa6eda9c7e7a/eol-globi-lib/src/test/java/org/eol/globi/util/ExternalIdUtilTest.java#L15</p>
<p>As far as iNaturalist goes - instead of getting them to use GloBI identifiers, they are using their own identifiers along with some naming convention to integrate (or point to) with GloBI.</p>
<p>I found that the iNaturalist development team have keep busy in keeping the site up and running, and need simple integration solution to help integrate with other systems. The benefit would be that you control which iNaturalist taxa are linked to what MDD entries.</p>
<p>https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/252</p>
<p>https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/668</p>
<p>https://github.com/inaturalist/inaturalist/blob/aa9e52d250378b3283c11f193c2017a19b53c7cf/tools/globi_observation_links.rb#L48</p>
<p>And, supporting a MDD landing page with id only would facilitate integrating MDD with GloBI, and perhaps also other resources like Wikidata etc. The link with the id only used to work (as species-id), so that can be restored easily enough.</p>
<p>iNaturalist are currently using an old style MDD link: https://www.mammaldiversity.org/species-account.php?genus=Felis&amp;species=chaus</p>
<p>Presumably they want to create a link with genus and species parameters. It should be simple enough to code something that, in the absence of an id parameter, parses through the data file until the line matching the genus and species and retrieving the id.</p>
<p>The current MDD version with genus+species+id doesn’t help iNaturalist. If they have the id they can use that directly and if they don’t have the id they need something for genus+species.</p>
<p>I’ve just add a bit of code to my fork, which takes either species-id OR genus and species:</p>
<p>https://jts1882.github.io/mdd/explore.html#species-id=1006023</p>
<p>https://jts1882.github.io/mdd/explore.html#genus=panthera&amp;species=tigris</p>
<p>The code for the genus+species option is lines 238-258 in filter.js.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="jts1882">@jts1882</span> wow that was fast! And the lookup by id renders quickly also.</p>
<p>Just curious is there a way to link directly to subspecies like:</p>
<p>Enhydra lutris nereis ?</p>
<p>as retrieved from nominalNames column in mdd.csv ? What would you link to? The subspecies information is in nominal names section in the species infobox.</p>
<p>https://www.mammaldiversity.org/explore.html#genus=Enhydra&amp;species=lutris&amp;id=1005842</p>
<p>Or in the treeview version in my fork:</p>
<p>https://jts1882.github.io/mdd/tree.html#genus=Enhydra&amp;species=lutris</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="jts1882">@jts1882</span> thanks again for your prompt reply.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I guess I’d want to link to a specific nominal name in that list. Perhaps highlight the selection expressed in the url query syntax?</p>
<p>Just wondering, is it correct that all species in MDD have at least one nominal name? If so, does that mean that all mammal species have at least one subspecies. btw - that tree view looks pretty neat! <span class="citation" data-cites="n8upham">@n8upham</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="jts1882">@jts1882</span> please let me know if you need any additional information to help address the issue on non-resolving permalinks including only taxon ids. (e.g. https://www.mammaldiversity.org/explore.html#id=1004444 does not resolve, but https://www.mammaldiversity.org/explore.html#genus=Acerodon&amp;species=jubatus&amp;id=1004444 does). Thanks for following up here <span class="citation" data-cites="jhpoelen">@jhpoelen</span> ! I do have a couple questions, also for <span class="citation" data-cites="jts1882">@jts1882</span> : (1) When you say &gt; supporting a MDD landing page with id only would facilitate integrating MDD with GloBI, and perhaps also other resources like Wikidata etc.</p>
<p>Does that mean that the MDD would then create a separate landing page that would have mapping between different taxonomies + the relevant hyperlinks? E.g., MDD-iNaturalist would be one mapping, MDD-GloBI could be another? Glad to look into developing this, and largely take your lead on the infrastructure if my team could then curate the name mappings.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><span class="citation" data-cites="jts1882">@jts1882</span> The tree-view on your fork is excellent! Could you help us implement that for the current taxonomy version (now v1.10) and indicate the steps needed to merge your fork with ours? The solution you have for an <em>option</em> between genus/species look-up versus ID is exactly what we are looking for. <span class="citation" data-cites="liphardt">@liphardt</span> may be able to help here too.</li>

<p>In this context, I imagined use of MDD identifiers to help point to html pages on mammaldiversity.org webpages .</p>
<p>E.g.,</p>
<p>https://www.mammaldiversity.org/explore.html#id=1005842</p>
<p>would point to</p>
<p>The MDD landing page of Enhydra lutris .</p>
<p>This would enable GloBI and others to easily infer some clickable link from a MDD taxon id (e.g., MDD:1005842 -&gt;https://www.mammaldiversity.org/explore.html#id=1005842 ) .</p>
<p>A separate topic would be to try and support external identifiers, like iNaturalist taxon ids. Maintaining this kind of mapping needs constant review and updates as taxonomy identifiers come and go, even if the IDs are marketed as “permanent.” This is why I internally (in my quiet voice ; )) translate PIDs (permanent identifiers) into APIDs (aspirationally permanent identifiers).</p>
<p>And cross-domain concept/id mapping that is a separate topic in my mind. Glad to share ideas on that also if needed.</p>
<p>I agree with <span class="citation" data-cites="jhpoelen">@jhpoelen</span> that links in the format he proposes would make it easier to integrate MDD links into other sources. For example, right now if I wanted to add cross-links to MDD to Hesperomys, I’d have to store the full link like https://www.mammaldiversity.org/explore.html#genus=Sorex&amp;species=monticola&amp;id=1004263, and that link would break if you ever decide to rename the species to <em>Sorex monticolus</em>. But if https://www.mammaldiversity.org/explore.html#id=1004263 worked and was guaranteed to continue resolving to the same species, I’d be able to store just 1004263 as an MDD identifier and I wouldn’t have to worry about updating the link if MDD changes its spelling.</p>
<p>Also agree that the tree view in <span class="citation" data-cites="jts1882">@jts1882</span>’s fork is beautiful; would be great if that can be incorporated into the main MDD website. I’m actually going to add similar UI elements to the next version of the Hesperomys frontend. Re: the permalinks.</p>
<p>I don’t understand how adding the genus and species to the permalink helps iNaturalist. As currently implemented, the genus and species part of the url don’t do anything and the iNaturalist link is dead. The ID part is all important and the only bit needed, as long as its the fourth element of the post-hash part of the url split on “=”.</p>
<p>My solution was to add a function to parse the url and exxtract all parameters. Then either id or genus+species links would work. Only the id one should be called a permalink, as the genus/species combination might change.</p>
<p>The parser function is parseURLforParameters() (line 302 of filter.js on my fork). It’s called from a modified version of goPermalink(event) (line 258).</p>
<p>To implement this change the easiest thing to do is replace goPermalink(event) in the master with goPermalink(event) and parseURLforParameters() from my fork.</p>
<p>Implementing the treeview, is more difficult. My fork has many changes and you might not want all of them. Also I think some of my changes were merged with the master at some point, but later removed, so a merge now might not work</p>
<p>I think the best thing is for me to synchronise my fork with the master and then make the changes again in such a way to minimise changes elsewhere. Then any merges should be simpler.<br />
I’ve synchronised my fork with the master and made additions to display the treeview page. This time I tried to avoid changing any of the existing files so nothing else changes. So at the moment the tree page works in isolation and isn’t accessible from the other pages. Once we get it working the other pages can be edited to add it to the menu.</p>
<p>However, I had to make changes to the head.html and header.html pages (in the _includes folder) to get the page functioning with the right CSS for the header and menu. The reason for this is that the path for css, js and other assets uses a relative url starting with a slash, e.g. “/css/main.css”, which starts at the root (i.e. “https://jts1882.github.io” in this case). My fork is in a subdirectory /mdd/ so the relative URLs don’t work with the slash. Removing the slash fixes the links. I think this should still work without changing the behaviour of other pages in the master, but am not totally sure.</p>
<p>With the proviso above, merging my changes into the master should produce a functioning treeview page without changing anything else. As a first step we can try this.</p>
<p>For the record, the changes involve four additional files:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>A “tree.md” file for the new page.</p></li>
<li><p>The “mammals.js” file with the treeview code</p></li>
<li><p>A “tree.css” for the formatting.</p></li>
<li><p>A “speciesinfo.js” file for displaying the information panel on the species. This is a modified extract of code from filter.js, which fixes a few of the formatting problems (e.g. overflows of long lines), italicises the nominal names, and shows the taxonomy with the changes made last year (i.e subclass, magnorder, etc). I made a new file to avoid changing filter.js.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>As for going forward, I can update the filter.js to handle genus+species (for iNaturalis) or id only links (for backward compatibilty). However, I think it best leave this for now and go step by step. Hi <span class="citation" data-cites="jts1882">@jts1882</span> I did the merge of your fork with the MDD master, but I’m not seeing the expected changes. I am seeing the “Treeview” tab in the Home page of the MDD now @ https://www.mammaldiversity.org/index.html (and screenshot), but then click on it the treeview doesn’t render.</p>
<p>Are there any particular reasons you can see why this might be? Thanks again for your help here</p>

<p>Okay <span class="citation" data-cites="jts1882">@jts1882</span> I’ve made some changes to get this Treeview working now – major thanks again for your help in assembling this!! The main thing I needed to do was remove those “/” relative links and then clean up some other remaining aspects of the mammals.js code (links to mammaldiversity.org instead of your fork, switched info icon symbol, added the MSW3 taxonomy file). It now seems to be working entirely as intended – see attached screenshots and https://www.mammaldiversity.org/tree.html <img width="1241" alt="Screenshot 2023-06-10 at 3 14 00 PM" src="https://github.com/mammaldiversity/mammaldiversity.github.io/assets/12020947/84dcce61-991b-4b15-9c40-8fd9f714d5ac"> <img width="1153" alt="Screenshot 2023-06-10 at 3 19 22 PM" src="https://github.com/mammaldiversity/mammaldiversity.github.io/assets/12020947/1312d92f-d0e6-4359-8a78-c893af55bf66"></p>
<p>Thanks also to <span class="citation" data-cites="jhpoelen">@jhpoelen</span> for helping me learn more about the Github backend these last few days.</p>
<p>Still unresolved is the <em>permalinks</em> issue that is the topic of this Issue – so I’ll keep this open for now while we address that front.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="jts1882">@jts1882</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="n8upham">@n8upham</span> nice! Y’all are getting fancy with those tree views! A little tip - if you reference the issue number (e.g., <code>#24</code> or <code>https://github.com/mammaldiversity/mammaldiversity.github.io/issues/24</code>) as part of the commit message, then the changes will be automatically associated with the referenced issue. Apologies for the slow response, but I see you’ve got the treeview working.</p>
<p>I’ve restored the changes to filter.js in my fork (see Jan 24 post) with my solution to fix the permalink issue, that accepts urls with either id OR genus + species.</p>
<ul>
<li>The code parses the hash part of the url to get the parameters (order doesn’t matter)</li>
<li>If an id is available that is used. Any content in genus or species parameters is ignored and the link should continue to work if a species is moved to a different genus. This is the permalink.</li>
<li>If there is no id parameter, then genus and species are used. This should make the iNaturalist links function. An issue here is that as currently implemented, the the datafile is parsed twice so is even slower. This is not a permalink.</li>
<li>In addition it checks for a search parameter that can be used to populated the filter box, e.g.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>Id alone: https://jts1882.github.io/mdd/explore.html#id=1006023</p>
<p>Genus+species: https://jts1882.github.io/mdd/explore.html#genus=panthera&amp;species=tigris</p>
<p>All three: https://jts1882.github.io/mdd/explore.html#genus=panthera&amp;species=tigris&amp;id=1006023</p>
<p>To list all the Felidae: https://jts1882.github.io/mdd/explore.html#search=Felidae</p>
<p>P.S. I’m still having issues with the relative urls and the root on my fork requiring an extra “/mdd/”). I had to change some links from “/js/filter.js” to “js/filter.js” in the .md files. However, the only changes to make the above work are in filter.js.</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="jts1882">@jts1882</span> Very cool to see that you’ve gotten creative with the permalink issues. Are you planning to prepare a pull request also? I think it’d be great to have this information integrated in the https://mammaldiversity.org site. I’m cautious with the pull request as I’m still not sure about the urls relative to the root (see my PS above).</p>
<p>However, I think these show work in the mammaldiversity.org, so with that warning I’ll try and make a pull request. Antillomys rayi – I can’t remember why we included it as a recently extinct species (I think I remember seeing something from a paper saying that it was found with rat skeletons, but I haven’t checked); I’m retaining the species on our list for now; regardless, the name is actually unavailable for the time being, as its description appears in the supplemental material of the paper; its currently being redescribed by the authors in Therya (I reviewed the paper recently).</p>
<p>Megalomys camerhegne – with recently extinct species, I think I’ve been a lot less careful about which species I include and the since 1500 limit is kind of difficult to follow strictly. I’m going to add this species if you feel it is worth doing for consistency.</p>
<p>Archaeolemur edwardsi – I’m pretty confused on why I even included this species in the first place… I might remove it but I’m going to spend some time looking into it a bit more and remove that it was listed in MSW3.</p>
<p>Cordimus hooijeri – will go ahead and add the species as extinct: Zijlstra, J.S., McFarlane, D.A., Hoek Ostende, L.W. van den and Lundberg, J. 2014. New rodents (Cricetidae) from the Neogene of Curaçao and Bonaire, Dutch Antilles. Palaeontology 57(5):895-908. doi:10.1111/pala.12091</p>
<p>If you have any other recently extinct species you think should be included, definitely let us know. I have had a hard time keeping track of them.</p>
<p>Definitely agree that this is a tricky area since extinction cutoffs are necessarily arbitrary and for many species the date of extinction is not precisely established. Your precise inclusion criteria are obviously up to you, but my thinking is that the purpose of including extinct species is to give a better sense of what the full modern mammal fauna is like, including those species that were lost due to human action over the last few centuries. Therefore, it makes sense to err on the side of including additional species even if their exact extinction date is not firmly established. However, that does obviously mean more work in tracking literature on new species and radiocarbon dating.</p>
<p>In the Caribbean, you (and the Red List) include many species (e.g., <em>Nesophontes</em>, many echimyids and oryzomyines) based on subfossils because of evidence that they were found together with European-introduced rodents. I think it’s consistent to add <em>Antillomys</em> and <em>Megalomys camerhogne</em> (not <em>camerhegne</em>, misspelled it above), even if it’s not positively established those species survived past 1500. There are many other extinct species from the Holocene of the Caribbean (sloths, monkeys, bats, a few more rodents), but as far as I know they went extinct earlier. Reference for <em>camerhogne</em> is Mistretta, B.A., Giovas, C.M., Weksler, M. and Turvey, S.T. 2021-04-07. Extinct insular oryzomyine rice rats (Rodentia: Sigmodontinae) from the Grenada Bank, southern Caribbean. Zootaxa 4951(3):434-460. doi:10.11646/zootaxa.4951.3.2</p>
<p>On Madagascar, there are also lots of recently extinct species (<em>Cryptoprocta spelea</em>, many lemurs, a few bats and rodents, <em>Plesiorycteropus</em>, hippos). You include the fossa, two of the three hippos, and a few lemurs, but not the others. There is some C-14 dating and some rumors that some of these survived into historical times, but I’d have to do more reading to see if there’s solid evidence for any others making it past 1500. I agree and that’s why I’ve erred on the side of caution on many of them so far. But with my general focus on living mammals it’s been hard to keep track of just recently extinct mammals (my knowledge of mammalian fossil literature is much sparser than that of living species). For these Caribbean mammals, we summarized a lot of these extinction dates per island (last appearances) in our 2017 Annual Reviews paper: https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-110316-022754 – I’ll attach a PDF since Fig 2 is helpful visually.<br />

<p>I’ll also attach a CSV file from the Dryad download (https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.tj4p5) that has those dates +/- error (sigma) <a href="https://github.com/mammaldiversity/mammaldiversity.github.io/files/10542967/fossil.csv">fossil.csv</a></p>
<p>Antillomys rayi is listed as 674 +/- 54 ybp according to MacPhee &amp; Flemming 1999 – which incidentally has a lot of other info on the last 500 years of extinctions: https://www.amnh.org/content/download/232397/4027716/file/Requiem%20Aeternam,%20The%20Last%20Five%20Hundred%20Years%20of%20Mammalian%20Species%20Extinctions.PDF</p>
<p>Here are my notes on the Jelle’s comments and changes within Chiroptera.</p>
<p>Nycteris vinsoni –&gt; N. macrotis comment – I’ll add Monadjem et al., 2010 as a reference.</p>
<p>Rhinolophus kahuzi -&gt; R. ruwenzorii Rhinolophus cohenae, R. mabuensis, R. smithersi -&gt; R. hildebrandtii Rhinolophus gorongosae, R. rhodesiae -&gt; R. simulator The Rhinolophus lumps are VERY tentative at the moment and may be reversed based on how discussions are going with Bat Names currently. Lumps were endorsed by Terry Demos and Bruce Patterson initially but paper is not discrete in their lumping of these taxa (although it is pretty heavily implied). So it might be pertinent to continue recognizing these species on Hesperomys until we’ve really decided on what to do with these taxa.</p>
<p>Coelops hirsutus &lt; C. robinsoni – I actually just lumped this species back into C. robinsoni based on comments from the Bat Names database, who don’t Heaney et al., 2016 provide enough (any) evidence for its species status (this is opposed to Rhinolophus hirsutus and Hipposideros antricola, which they agreed about recognizing based on the provided proof). So up to you about recognizing this form (I personally was pro-recognizing it based on biogeography, but I was out ruled in this case).</p>
<p>Balionycteris seimund &lt; B. maculata – I’ll go ahead and add Lim et al., 2017 to the reference</p>
<p>Doryrhina vs. Hipposideros (-) – I have now moved the six Indo-Australian species back to Hipposideros following discussion with the Bat Names database (I initially followed the HMW series, which moved the based on alleged relation to D. cyclops, but I now see that this wasn’t based on any other publications). I was not sure what to do with camerunensis, but I have kept it in Doryrhina since the Bat Names database does the same.</p>
<p>Hipposideros swinhoei vs. swinhoii (-) – I will probably change this to swinhoii in accordance with Hesperomys, although we should bring this up with Bat Names (they use swinhoei).</p>
<p>Hipposideros fasensis and H. parnabyi (+) – I’ve been torn about whether to recognize them or not, but because no data was given on why they were being recognized, I haven’t included them. Bat Names I think had them initially as species but also came to the conclusion of not recognizing them for now.</p>
<p>Hipposideros khasiana (+) – Nancy Simons and a few others at Bat Names agree with me that this name is certainly a nomen nudum and Nancy was able to contact the original descriptor of the name, who plans on republishing it with a designated holotype and full description now that we’ve given them a heads up on its nomenclatural availability. We all agreed that it is a valid species though and are looking forward to its redescription (they also have more specimens to work with for the species now!). I’ll add some clarifying comments on it.</p>
<p>Macronycteris vittata vs. vittatus (-) – probably going to change this to match Hesperomys, but need to check with Bat Names.</p>
<p>Miniopterus arenarius (+) and Miniopterus eschscholtzii and M. blepotis (+) – These changes have been contentious and we had a good bit of comments about it from Bat Names. I’m very skeptical about the species limits within these groups of Miniopterus, but given who the authors of the HMW chapter are, I decided to follow them, as they probably have knowledge I don’t about these clades. Plus, I think the Miniopterus schreibersii group is best with just giving this hypothesis on species designations for now. I think Bat Names has ultimately decided to recognize these species as well, but it was a split debate.</p>
<p>Chaerephon shortridgei (-) – I’m going to have to look at this more, but I’ll probably add it back given that Bat Names might be recognize it (as a species of Mops).</p>
<p>Micronomus, Ozimops, and Setirostris (+) – A similar thing happened with Macropus, which was split into Macropus, Osphranter, and Notamacropus, which I agreed on given the morphological disparities between these groups and the paraphyletic nature of Macropus with Wallabia (which I think also could’ve just been included under Macropus, but I like the current arrangement). Given that Mormopterus has a strange geographic spread, I like the recognition of the genera as distinct for now and Bat Names agrees.</p>
<p>Chaerephon vs. Mops – I actually disagree with Bat Names about recognizing Chaerephon as a subgenus of Mops, but the data does show that these to genera are not monophyletic with respects to the other (with one species being completely separate from the two genera). Hopefully these get resolved more adequately soon, but at this point I just follow Bat Names. They kind of did this with Neoromicia and Laephotis before that paper split the genera up into a number of genera, which I disagreed with at the time too, so Chaerephon and Mops may represent a number of diagnosable genera eventually too.</p>
<p>Molossus fluminensis and M. nigricans (+) – I think we’ll need to look into this more, but it seems like it holds up. I’ll keep the names for now but add a comment about castaneus probably being the oldest name for M. rufus and holosericeus for M. fluminensis. Definitely worth publishing if everything works out.</p>
<p>Nyctinomus vs. Tadarida and Nyctinomus thomasi (-) – I did not recognize these changes because of the general confusion surrounding Tadarida at this point, which seems to be a paraphyletic mess. Also, HMW doesn’t recognize these changes and neither does Bat Names at this point. However, I do think that Nyctinomus and Nyctinomus thomasi are worth recognizing if Bat Names agrees, so I will bring it up with them on our slack and see what they think.</p>
<p>Tomopeas ravum vs. ravus (-) – I will likely follow Hesperomys on this, but need to bring it up with Bat Names.</p>
<p>Anoura aequatoris and A. peruana (-) – I have now removed both of these species.</p>
<p>Artibeus vs. Dermanura and Koopmania (-) – I removed Koopmania recently, moving concolor back to Artibeus (Bat Names and no other source uses it). However, I would suggest using Dermanura, as Bat Names and most Neotropical bat researchers are recognizing it based on the consistent morphological distinctions between the two genera and their monophyletic nature. Dermanura has gone back and forth between publications and I think we should all try to be on the same page here so that it does become more normalized as the genus outside of the sphere of Neotropical researchers.</p>
<p>Gardnerycteris crenulata vs. crenulatum (-) – I will likely go with Hesperomys on this one, but need to run it by Bat Names.</p>
<p>Lophostoma evote vs. evotis (-) – I will likely go with Hesperomys on this one, but need to run it by Bat Names.</p>
<p>Vampyriscus nymphaeus vs. nymphaea (-) – I will likely go with Hesperomys on this one, but need to run it by Bat Names.</p>
<p>Desmalopex leucoptera and microleucoptera vs. leucopterus (-) – I will likely go with Hesperomys on this one, but need to run it by Bat Names.</p>
<p>Notopteris neocaledonica vs. neocaledonicus (-) – I will likely go with Hesperomys on this one, but need to run it by Bat Names.</p>
<p>Nyctimene minuta vs. N. varius (+/-) – I will likely go with Hesperomys on this one, but need to run it by Bat Names. I was actually the one who decided to move minuta to N. albiventer and seems like most people agree with it so far (wrote the accounts for Nyctimene in the HMW, Norberto Gianini approved). Kind of happy about that.</p>
<p>Pteropus gilliardi vs. gilliardorum (-) – I will leave this one for now, however, I’ve skimmed Dubois, 2007 and am starting to agree with that paper. This is going to be a bigger conversation when we get to Lepilemur…</p>
<p>Pteropus intermedius -&gt; P. vampyrus (+) – I actually prefer to retain P. intermedius and so does Bat Names apparently (still in discussion), so we might be adding this species back and I would recommend you retain it too for now.</p>
<p>Pteropus natalis (-) – I’ll add a comment about it, but I think Bat Names agrees not to recognize the species and I haven’t looked to hard into the taxonomy of this form yet.</p>
<p>Stenonycteris lanosa vs. lanosus (-) – I will likely go with Hesperomys on this one, but need to run it by Bat Names.</p>
<p>Styloctenium mindorense vs. mindorensis (-) – I will likely go with Hesperomys on this one, but need to run it by Bat Names.</p>
<p>Rhinolophus pumilus &lt; R. cornutus (+) – I reference Wu et al., 2012 as an example of a paper that doesn’t recognize it, although I should clear that up a bit. Gabor and I decided to recognize pumilus tentatively as a distinct species in HMW (I wrote the Rhinolophus accounts), but it was mostly based on morphology and the fact that the taxonomy of the group is a bit all over the place. Ultimately, I think many of the forms within this group may be conspecific based on low molecular divergence, but we’ll see.</p>
<p>Paratriaenops furcula – I’ll revise the comments.</p>
<p>Aeorestes/Dasypterus/Lasiurus (-) – We plan on removing this change at some point (I want to do it now, but Nate has wanted to wait until a publication we’re working on with Bat names is published). It consensus is just using Lasiurus, so definitely don’t recognize them as distinct genera.</p>
<p>Afronycteris nana vs. nanus (-) – I changed it to nana recently (my notes were switched on it though), so already done.</p>
<p>Eptesicus guadeloupensis and E. lynni (+) – I’m really hesitant to call all the Caribbean populations synonyms of E. fuscus, but based on recent work, a lot of people have decided to synonymize them. Eptesicus in the Caribbean needs a real revision because I do think they will end up distinct based on high divergence.</p>
<p>Eptesicus kobayashii -&gt; E. pachyomus (+/-) – I actually just added kobayashii back as a species for now based on conversations with Bat Names. There’s no papers that actually deal with the species taxonomy, so I am now tentatively retaining it and I would suggest you do too for now.</p>
<p>Glauconycteris curryi vs. G. curryae (-) – Again, won’t make the change for now but we’ll discuss this more…</p>
<p>Myotis ancricola and M. annatessae (-) – I’m retaining the species because of the lack of clarity about this in the paper (and see comments under the Rhinolophus lumps earlier). The other changes from the same paper were used because they directly reference making the changes.</p>
<p>Myotis australis (-) – I actually added this species back as well, so no need to change it.</p>
<p>Myotis niasensis -&gt; M. muricola (+) – I actually can’t remember why I haven’t used this change… Going to look into it more.</p>
<p>Neoromicia anchietae vs. N. anchieta (-) – I will likely go with Hesperomys on this one, but need to run it by Bat Names.</p>
<p>Plecotus christii vs. christiei (-) – I changed it back to christiei based on comments from Bat names that I’ll need to review. Stay tuned.</p>
<p>Baeodon (-) – made this change, although I moved Rhogeessa gracilis to the genus too based on more recent papers that suggest moving it to Baeodon too: Hoofer, S. R., &amp; Van Den Bussche, R. A. 2003. Molecular phylogenetics of the chiropteran family Vespertilionidae. Acta Chiropterologica, 5(Supplement), 1-63.|Volleth, M., Heller, K. G., &amp; Fahr, J. (2006).

<p>Scotophilus borbonicus (-) – I also disagree with the Goodman paper and reverted this change.</p>
<p>Arielulus torquatus vs. Thainycteris torquatus (-) – This one is based mostly on the usage of the name in the HMW series and it looks that Bat Names agrees with the change for now. But I’ll need to look into it a bit more before I give a decision on whether to keep the change.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rhinolophus kahuzi -&gt; R. ruwenzorii Rhinolophus cohenae, R. mabuensis, R. smithersi -&gt; R. hildebrandtii Rhinolophus gorongosae, R. rhodesiae -&gt; R. simulator The Rhinolophus lumps are VERY tentative at the moment and may be reversed based on how discussions are going with Bat Names currently. Lumps were endorsed by Terry Demos and Bruce Patterson initially but paper is not discrete in their lumping of these taxa (although it is pretty heavily implied). So it might be pertinent to continue recognizing these species on Hesperomys until we’ve really decided on what to do with these taxa.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I already made the change, so I think I’ll keep them lumped until MDD changes this back.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Coelops hirsutus &lt; C. robinsoni – I actually just lumped this species back into C. robinsoni based on comments from the Bat Names database, who don’t Heaney et al., 2016 provide enough (any) evidence for its species status (this is opposed to Rhinolophus hirsutus and Hipposideros antricola, which they agreed about recognizing based on the provided proof). So up to you about recognizing this form (I personally was pro-recognizing it based on biogeography, but I was out ruled in this case).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OK, I’ll add it back. I also find it biogeographically plausible that this should be a species, but I feel like there’s not enough information to go against the experts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Molossus fluminensis and M. nigricans (+) – I think we’ll need to look into this more, but it seems like it holds up. I’ll keep the names for now but add a comment about castaneus probably being the oldest name for M. rufus and holosericeus for M. fluminensis. Definitely worth publishing if everything works out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just to be clear, <em>castaneus</em> and <em>holosericeus</em> are both senior synonyms of <em>fluminensis</em> based on geography. <em>rufus</em> is older than any of these.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nyctinomus vs. Tadarida and Nyctinomus thomasi (-) – I did not recognize these changes because of the general confusion surrounding Tadarida at this point, which seems to be a paraphyletic mess. Also, HMW doesn’t recognize these changes and neither does Bat Names at this point. However, I do think that Nyctinomus and Nyctinomus thomasi are worth recognizing if Bat Names agrees, so I will bring it up with them on our slack and see what they think.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ll await what the Bat Names people say.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Artibeus vs. Dermanura and Koopmania (-) – I removed Koopmania recently, moving concolor back to Artibeus (Bat Names and no other source uses it). However, I would suggest using Dermanura, as Bat Names and most Neotropical bat researchers are recognizing it based on the consistent morphological distinctions between the two genera and their monophyletic nature.

</blockquote>
<p>OK, I’ll make <em>Dermanura</em> a genus since you’re confident this change will stick.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Eptesicus kobayashii -&gt; E. pachyomus (+/-) – I actually just added kobayashii back as a species for now based on conversations with Bat Names. There’s no papers that actually deal with the species taxonomy, so I am now tentatively retaining it and I would suggest you do too for now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The HMW account for <em>pachyomus</em> did have some on-point comments about this name, but I’ll change it back to a species based on your comments.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Myotis ancricola and M. annatessae (-) – I’m retaining the species because of the lack of clarity about this in the paper (and see comments under the Rhinolophus lumps earlier). The other changes from the same paper were used because they directly reference making the changes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I reread the paper and I feel they’re actually more definite about these two than the others. On p. 477 the say about <em>ancricola</em> and <em>annatessae</em>: "Compared to genetic distances observed in other _Myotis) bats, these taxa should be considered conspecific“. For <em>annamiticus</em> (p. 473) they only say”These pairwise comparisons were much below what is expected for inter-specific comparisons (Baker and Bradley 2006)", which seems less definite.</p>

<p>Baeodon (-) – made this change, although I moved Rhogeessa gracilis to the genus too based on more recent papers that suggest moving it to Baeodon too: Hoofer, S. R., &amp; Van Den Bussche, R.

<p>OK, I’ll put <em>gracilis</em> in <em>Baeodon</em> too. However, Baird et al. (2008:750), who found <em>gracilis</em> and <em>alleni</em> to be very close genetically, had some doubt that their specimen identifications were correct, and I don’t see discussion of <em>gracilis</em> in the two later papers (their trees just say “<em>Baeodon</em>”). Concerning the merger of Laephotis botswana with L. angolensis, I’d rather follow Monadjem et al. (2020), who still consider Laephotis botswanae to be a valid species.</p>

Hey Victor <span class="citation" data-cites="VicVC">@VicVC</span>, I’m glad to see you commenting on this! I’ll provide some comments to your comments below.</p>
<p><em>Laephotis botswanae</em> - Is there any particular reason for not following the lump proposed by Taylor et al., 2022 (which also has Ara on the paper)? I though they made a pretty convincing case to lump <em>botswanae</em> into <em>L. angolensis</em> given the paraphyletic nature of their molecular data (although I would’ve liked to see more morphological evidence to make the revision more integrative).

<p>As for the other omitted species, thank you for bringing them up. This is based on a match between MDD and Hesperomys, so there area few that we both already have (<em>Rhinolophus chutamasae</em> and <em>Rhinolophus namuli</em>), but the other three (<em>Pseudoromicia mbamminkom</em>, <em>Pseudoromicia principis</em>, and <em>Myotis barquezi</em>) are on my list of species to add to the next MDD version (and I’m sure Jelle will add those species as well once we’ve gone through the current listing).</p>
<p>Also, I was wondering your personal perspective on the situation with African Rhinolophus that has been discussed in the Bat Names slack recently (I’m still going back and forth about whether to include or omit the various species suggested for lumping).</p>
<p>Hello Connor <span class="citation" data-cites="connorjburgin">@connorjburgin</span> , I stand corrected.</p>
<p>I still have quite a backlog of papers I need to go through in more detail and Taylor et al (2022) is one of these. Reading through this, I must agree that the two species should be lumped into <em>L. angolensis</em>.</p>
<p>I stayed away from the African <em>Rhinolophus</em> discussion in the Bat Names slack as I think this is still a very volatile situation, and I have no hands-on experience with this group. My feeling on this is that - as stated by Terry - given the lack of convincing data (pointing to either lumping or splitting) most (if not all) of these taxa should be considered separate species. Just wanted to briefly comment on some of these that remain unresolved:</p>
<p>Decisions Made:</p>
<p>Myotis ancricola and M. annatessae will stay on the MDD for now, given that the language used in the paper doesn’t explicitly lump either species into M. nepalensis, which is the same decision made by Batnames.</p>
<p>Thianycteris torquata will remain in Thainycteris rather than Arielulus based on morphological similarities to T. aureocollaris and the general consensus within the south-east Asian bat community that the two are included under Thainycteris together. Also, there was a recent paper that included both species in a molecular study, finding them to be sister species (see the recent Gorfol et al. papers, which I’m referencing on the MDD now): Görföl, T., Furey, N. M., Bates, P. J., &amp; Csorba, G. (2018). The identity of’Falsistrellus’ affinis from Myanmar and Cambodia and new records of Hypsugo dolichodon from these countries. Acta Chiropterologica, 20(2), 301-309.</p>
<p>I’m adding back all the Rhinolophus lumps from the Demos et al. paper because they didn’t explicitly decide to lump them (despite heavily implying it), and because Batnames will be continuing to include the species.</p>
<p>Decisions Pending:</p>
<p>Most of the spelling changes are being run by Batnames (Except for a few that I’m commenting under a different issue tab that I will not be excepting from Hesperomys)</p>
<p>Molossus fluminensis and whether castaneus has priority: I expect to keep this as fluminensis for now pending further research looking at the holotypes of each name, but we’ll see.</p>
<p>Nyctinomus + Nyctinomus thomasi - don’t expect these changes to be made by Batnames (which means MDD wouldn’t recognize them) since they were based on pretty small amounts of data, although there is a chance it’ll be recognized.</p>
<p>Thanks, I expect I’ll follow your lead on most or all of these. <span class="citation" data-cites="JelleZijlstra">@JelleZijlstra</span>, with regards to Vampyriscus nymphaea/nymphaeus, I can’t find anywhere that lists any form of ‘nymphaea’ like route from Greek or Latin as an adjective, all of them are listing them as nouns, so the correct spelling would be ‘nymphaea’ since that’s how it was spelt in the original description. Was wondering if you’d be able to provide further explanation and why you consider the name an adjective? http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dnumfai%3Dos</p>
<p><a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=numf-ai%3Dos&amp;la=greek&amp;can=numf-ai%3Dos0">νυμφ-αῖος</a> is an adjective meaning “of the nymphs”. In Latin it would be <em>nymphaeus</em>. This might be my inexperience with Greek and Latin showing, but how do we know it was based off the Greek root and not the Latin root? This is just on Wiktionary, but it says the Latin form is ‘nymphaea’ and is apparently a noun? https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nymphaea#:~:text=Noun,species%20of%20the%20genus%20Nymphaea.</p>
<p>https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0059:entry=nymphaea I suppose there is a Latin noun <em>nymphaea</em> “water lily”, but it just seems a lot more plausible that Thomas would have named the species “of the nymphs” (a plausible association for a bat) than that he would have named it after a water lily for some unstated reason. The next species in the paper is named <em>thyone</em>, after a Greek minor deity (an alternative name for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semele). That makes sense, thanks for the explanation! I agree with your logic, so I’ll treat it as an adjective. Almost done with MDD updates finally! Here are my responses by change.</p>
<p>Murexia melanura vs. melanurus (-) – I will follow the Hesperomys spelling.</p>
<p>“Murexia xenochromus” – wow, I hadn’t seen this but that definitely appears to be a hoax of some sort cause I’ve never seen that name (the page is now deleted so I wasn’t able to see it).</p>
<p>Myoictis wavica vs. wavicus (-) – although nobodies made this change, I agree with this change and think we should use the Hesperomys spelling.</p>
<p>Caluromysiops irrupta vs. irruptus (-) – because the name has not been around for 100 years without anyone using the alternate spelling, it should probably be changed. However, we might want to email Bob Voss and Sharon Jansa about it, as they might have some more to say about changing it. I’ll leave it on the MDD for now but add a comment.</p>
<p>Marmosa waterhousei vs. waterhousii (-) – I will make the change on the MDD to follow Hesperomys.</p>
<p>Dactylopsila kambuayai (though apparently it’s not extinct) – this is based entirely on the Handbook series, I think Ken Aplin (who recently passed away) is the one with proof that the species is still extant, but I think Stephen Jackson or Kris Helgen would be good people to ask about this further (I think I did ask Kris a while back but can’t remember his response).</p>
<p>Phalanger breviceps &lt; P. orientalis (though I haven’t yet seen the source) – Just sent you this.</p>
<p>Thylogale browni vs. brownii (-) – will follow Hesperomys on this.</p>
<p>Petaurus biacensis and P. papuanus (-/+) – This is definitely a difficult one, as I don’t think any of the three proposed options really make me feel comfortable. I chose to include it in P. notatus because I was working on a book for Lynx Edicions at the time, and including it in P. breviceps didn’t make sense biogeographically and P. notatus had a distribution up to Cape York, which was the closes to papuanus. However, after thinking about it for a while, I actually agree with you in recognizing papuanus as a species and giving strict indication of why we chose to do so for now, especially since molecular data shows that there are likely multiple species in New Guinea and that these forms are separate from Australian populations. I will add papuanus as a separate species, but I am retaining P. biacensis, as I can’t find any sources that synonymize the name at the moment.</p>
<p>Pseudochirops dahlii vs. Petropseudes (-) – Honestly, I’m pretty amazed that this hasn’t been followed by most subsequent authors, but it seems like there are multiple publications supporting this lump. I will follow this lump, but this is what Jackson and Groves 2015 say about it: “An assessment by Meredith et al. (2009a: 567) found Pseudochirops to be paraphyletic with respect to Petropseudes, grouping the latter more closely to Pseudochirops cupreus than to Pseudochirops archeri. As a result they suggested subsuming Petropseudes dahlii into Pseudochirops as Pseudochirops (Petropseudes) dahlii (Meredith et al. (2009: 567). We here retain the distinctive genus Petropseudes, but recommend revision of the entire subfamily to determine whether the monophyletic clades require recognition at generic level.” Meredith RW, Westerman M, Springer MS. A phylogeny of Diprotodontia (Marsupialia) based on sequences for five nuclear genes. Mol Phylogenet Evol. 2009a;51:554–571.| Meredith, R.W., Mendoza, M.A., Roberts, K.K., Westerman, M. and Springer, M.S. 2010. A phylogeny and timescale for the evolution of Pseudocheiridae (Marsupialia: Diprotodontia) in Australia and New Guinea. Journal of Mammalian Evolution 17(2):75-99.</p>
<p>Eulipotyphla vs. Lipotyphla (+) – Eulipotyphla has become the primarily used name for the group in most settings at this point, but much of the current literature is heavily influenced by our decision to use Eulipotyphla and the MDD and in the HMW series. This is what we put about ordinal names on the MDD’s about page, which highlights that Lipotyphla has been applied do various different inclusive definitions of different insectivore groups whereas Eulipotyphla is the first to apply to the modern interpretation of the order according to Woodman 2018: ‘Higher-level taxonomy.— Regarding higher-level taxonomy (i.e., all ranks above the species level), the MDD maintains an updated listing of all taxonomic ranks traditionally used below the order level as well as major superordinal clades. However, higher-level taxa do not yet have individual webpages, so this information is not yet fully transparent. For future updates, we intend to include individual taxonomic pages for each higher-level taxon in a similar format as the species-level pages. Ordinal names generally follow the arrangement presented in MSW3 with updates based on recent phylogenetic studies, resulting in Soricomorpha + Erinaceomorpha as Eulipotyphla, and Cetacea + Artiodactyla as a united Artiodactyla. The name Artiodactyla is preferred over the name Cetartiodactyla following the recommendation of Asher and Helgen (2010), which recalled the principles of Simpson (1945) to balance prevailing usage with priority in naming higher taxa. Asher and Helgen (2010) also recommended using Lipotyphla over Eulipotyphla, but confusion around the association of Lipotyphla with past definitions of the paraphyletic Insectivora assemblage (Woodman 2018) has prompted the MDD to favor Eulipotyphla as the first name used for the current definition of the order.’</p>
<p>Echinosorex gymnura vs. gymnurus (-) – given that Raffles name was lowercase, I think that retaining the name as an adjective would be more plausible. However, I’ll side with Hesperomys in this case and change the name to gymnura.</p>
<p>Otohylomys megalotis (-!) – I definitely appear to have just completely missed this (HMW doesn’t seem to have recognized it and I haven’t checked the reason why…), I’ll go ahead and make the move from Hylomys to Otohylomys: Bannikova, A.A., Лебедев, В.С., Абрамов, А.В. and Рожнов, В.В. 2014-06-04. Contrasting evolutionary history of hedgehogs and gymnures (Mammalia: Erinaceomorpha) as inferred from a multigene study. Biological Journal of the Linnean Society 112(3):499-519. doi:10.1111/bij.12299</p>
<p>Crocidura anselli vs. ansellorum, greenwoodi vs. greenwoodae (-) – leaving it for now like the other ones, but we’ll have some further discussion on this.</p>
<p>Crocidura dongyangjiangensis and C. huangshanensis (+) – I’ll look into changing dongyangjiangensis from 2020 to 2019, but this might be a hard one to interpret.</p>
<p>Crocidura tarfayaensis vs. tarfayensis (-) – I’ll change the spelling to match Hesperomys on the MDD.</p>
<p>Chimarrogale vs. Crossogale (-) – I think I’ll go ahead and remove Crossogale again (I’ve gone back and forth about this one). I don’t agree with recognizing it either (Kai He and I made the decision not to include it in the HMW volume), but I had added it back after to the MDD for some reason.</p>
<p>Episoriculus vs. Pseudosoriculus (-) – I don’t think the HMW recognized it because we hadn’t seen the publication and we would have recognized it if we had seen the publication (either that or Kai He didn’t want to recognize it because he didn’t want to accept work from those authors). I strongly support recognizing Pseudosoriculus as a genus given the evidence.</p>
<p>Sorex monticolus vs. S. monticola (-) – I’m leaving this one for now because of just how many times I’ve gone back and forth about it, but I’ll clarify the comments about following Woodman 2018 on the spelling. I’m sure you’re probably right about this, but this one needs to be discussed further because it seems like nobody can decide which interpretation is correct.</p>
<p>Suncus varilla vs. S. varillus (-) – I’ll change the spelling to varilla following Hesperomys, I don’t really know why I even have varillus.</p>
<p>Thanks! A few responses:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Understandable, we’ll have to follow up on this.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Sorry I actually switched the names here, I have <em>varillus</em> and you have <em>varilla</em>. The original name is <em>Crocidura varilla</em>. I’ll still use the Hesperomys spelling for Suncus varillus, I didn’t even check what we had, so that’s also my bad for doing so poorly! Followup on <em>Crocidura dongyangjiangensis</em>/<em>C. huangshanensis</em>: I got the description of <em>huangshanensis</em> now and it does have an LSID (https://zoobank.org/References/F4A3BC83-CD57-4B9D-BA03-86FA3D868AE2), indicating the date of publication as 24 January 2020. For <em>dongyangjiangensis</em> there is no LSID in the article, so the print publication date counts. The <a href="http://www.mammal.cn/EN/volumn/volumn_1288.shtml">publisher’s website</a> says the issue was published on January 30, 2020. So it’s quite possible that <em>huangshanensis</em> actually has priority. This is interesting. I’m going to send this information off to the ASM Nomenclature Committee to make sure I’m interpreting this correctly. Yes, we’re probably going to need someone who reads Chinese to make sure. Comment on subspecies/synonyms: pretty much all spelling differences at the synonym level will be ‘corrected’ to your list in the end because I hand typed them all and there are A TON of errors, so spelling wise, it’s fine to just leave the synonyms as they are for now and we’ll deal with it when we get there.</p>
<p>Lepus microtis vs. L. victoriae (-) – I’ll go ahead and use microtis, as the only reason I used victoriae was as a relict from starting with the HMW taxonomy. I didn’t really agree with using victoriae in the first place but never really had the push to change it.</p>
<p>Ochotona dabashanensis and O. xunhuaensis (-!) – So, I screwed the comments on this one up a bit on the MDD, they should both be considered synonyms of O. syrinx, not O. sikimaria (the correct comment should be this under O. syrinx: ‘has included O. sacraria and has been included under huangensis (now a synonym of dauurica); includes dabashanensis and xunhuaensis’, and not under O. sikimaria. I fixed that after sending you my matched list. Lissovsky, 2014 synonymized huangensis under dauurica and applied the name syrinx to the taxon formerly known as huangensis, also synonymizing xunhuaensis under the newly established O. syrinx. Liu et al., 2017 described dabashanensis, which was found to be paraphyletic with specimens labeled as xunhuaensis (= O. syrinx, which they do briefly acknowledge in their paper) by Wang et al., 2020, thus supporting the inclusion of dabashanensis under O. syrinx. I would strongly suggest using this arrangement, although I am up for discussion since Wang et al., 2020 did not strictly state that they were synonymizing dabashanensis under xunhuaensis (= O. syrinx). I also talked about it with Lissovsky out of pure confusion when working on the taxonomy of Ochotona for the Illustrated Checklist, and that is the arrangement he recommended. Lissovsky, A.A. 2014. Taxonomic revision of pikas Ochotona (Lagomorpha, Mammalia) at the species level. Mammalia 78(2): 199–216. Liu, S. Y., Jin, W., Liao, R., Sun, Z. Y., Zeng, T., Fu, J. R., … &amp; Chen, L. M. (2017).

<p>Prolagidae – I will move Prolagus to Ochotonidae based on your recommendation: Angelone, C., Prieto, J. and Gross, M. 2014. Complement to the study of the pikas (Lagomorpha, Ochotonidae) from the Middle Miocene of Gratkorn, Austria. Palaeobiodiversity and Palaeoenvironments 94(1):125-134. doi:10.1007/s12549-013-0146-4</p>
<p>Hesp Microperoryctes longicaudus vs. MDD longicauda – retaining MDD (as you are) Hesp Microperoryctes murinus vs. MDD murina – changing to Hesperomys on MDD. Hesp Peroryctes raffrayanus vs. MDD raffrayana – changing to Hesperomys on MDD.</p>
<p>Phataginus tetradactylus vs. tetradactyla (-) – will change to match Hesperomys.</p>
<p>Thanks for the explanation around <em>Ochotona</em>, it’s indeed quite confusing. I’ll synonymize both of these species under <em>syrinx</em> as you suggest. I’ve noted the Cuvier 1797 change and added to my list of stuff to check/do. Another one: Pallas, P.S. 1779. Novae species quadrupedum e glirium ordine cum illustrationibus variis complurium ex hoc ordine animalium. Wolfgang Walther, 388 pp.</p>
<p>According to Sherborn (1891, Sherborn, C.D. 1891. Dates of the Parts of P. S. Pallas’s ‘Icones Insect. p. Ross. Sibir.’ and ‘Nov. spec. Quadr. Glirium,’. Annals and Magazine of Natural History (6)7(38):236. https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/25164717 ) this was published in two parts: pp. 1-70 in 1778 and 71-388 in 1779. You mostly got this right already but I noticed one discrepancy in the MDD: <em>Dicrostonyx torquatus</em> should be 1779, not 1778. Pallas discrepancy noted. It’s funny that it’s in <em>Dicrostonyx</em> because that’s the group I’m working on for my thesis. Here’s some fun ones. You mentioned in an email that you received a paper about <em>Rhinolophus hipposideros</em> but couldn’t find it online yet. It’s now up on BioOne, apparently published last week (Benda et al., 2023). It splits <em>Rhinolophus midas</em> into a separate species, which I’m planning to accept. But it also references another paper I missed, Benda &amp; Mlíkovský (2022).</p>
<p>This argues that <em>Rhinolophus hipposideros</em> dates from André (1797), not Borkhausen (1797), which is probably correct (I haven’t waded through the 18th-century sales catalogs to confirm). In addition, they show that Bechstein (1799), which was thought to have been published in 1800, is actually from 1799.</p>
<p>I found that this has a few other consequences that they don’t call out: * <em>Bandicota indica</em> (Bechstein, 1799) is from 1799, not 1800 * <em>Nyctimene</em> (the genus) is attributable to André, 1797:60, not Borkhausen, 1797:86 as traditionally done. * <em>Vespertilio myosotis</em> André, 1797:46 predates <em>Vespertilio myotis</em> Borkhausen, 1797:80 as the earliest available name for <em>Myotis myotis</em>. I assume it can be disposed of as a nomen oblitum, but that would need to be published.</p>

<p>These were all published in this volume: https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/20230#page/10/mode/1up . It is for the year 1846 but has the date 1847 on the cover, so we should assume 1847 as the year of publication in the absence of evidence to the contrary. (It is possible that some parts of the volume were published earlier, but I haven’t seen concrete evidence.)</p>
<p>You already have some other names published in the same article as 1847 (e.g., <em>Dasymys incomtus</em>, <em>Helogale parvula</em>). They should all be 1847. I took a detailed look at the <em>Zoology of the Erebus and Terror</em>, which has a number of new species descriptions by J.E. Gray. It’s a very confusing work because there was a thirty-year gap between the publication of the first and last parts, and many references get the dates wrong. I wrote up a detailed account here: https://github.com/JelleZijlstra/taxonomy/blob/master/docs/biblio/erebus-terror.md.</p>
<p>We’ll run into this more when comparing years of publication for names, but these are the implications relevant to species currently considered valid:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Scotorepens greyii</em> was named in 1844, not 1842. MSW3 cites 1842 but no part of the <em>Erebus and Terror</em> was published in 1842. Jackson &amp; Groves (2015) cite Gray (1843) as the author but this is a nomen nudum. The name is available from <em>Erebus and Terror</em> pl. M20 published in December 1844.</li>
<li><em>Cephalorhynchus eutropia</em> was named in 1849, not 1846. It appears on pl. W34 of <em>Erebus and Terror</em>, but that plate was only published in 1875. The first published description is https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/12862040 (1849).</li>
</ul>
<p>A bit less definitely, it appears that the whale part of the work (“On the cetaceous animals”) was published in January 1847, not 1846 as generally assumed. This chapter introduced numerous new names, among which the following are currently considered valid: - <em>Caperea marginata</em> (Gray, 1847) (not 1846) - <em>Globicephala macrorhyncha</em> (Gray, 1847) (not 1846) - <em>Peponocephala electra</em> (Gray, 1847) (not 1846) - <em>Stenella attenuata</em> (Gray, 1847) (not 1846) Another group. I noticed that among several names published in volume 11 of the <em>Bulletin de l’Académie malgache</em>, I had some listed as 1928 and others as 1930:</p>

<p>Fortunately, this volume is on Google Books at https://books.google.nl/books?id=GIYIAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA4-PA95&amp;lpg=RA4-PA95&amp;dq=Description+d%27une+%22nouvelle+esp%C3%A8ce+de+Nesomys,+le+N.+lambertoni%22,+G.+Grand&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Xnf8JKsHzx&amp;sig=ACfU3U2zRxV06YqcX_XArSmmEPlwFlD1_Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjyopjgs-b_AhVZlGoFHWOVDPsQ6AF6BAgCEAM#v=onepage&amp;q=Description%20d’une%20%22nouvelle%20esp%C3%A8ce%20de%20Nesomys%2C%20le%20N.%20lambertoni%22%2C%20G.%20Grand&amp;f=false. Google Books is kind of hard to navigate sometimes, but if you download the PDF (for volumes 9-12), the table of contents for volume 11 is at p. 479 and the title page of is at p. 313. The volume is for the year 1928, but it bears the date 1929 on the title page, indicating that it was published in 1929. (This seems to have been the general practice for this journal: each volume was published the year after the year it covered.)</p>
<p>However, for some of these names I have 1930. This seems to go back to Allen (1939) and Helgen and McFadden (2001), but they don’t say why they think the volume was published in 1930, so I’m going to disregard this claim unless there is stronger evidence to back it up.</p>
<p>The volume also contains the description of a new bird species that is still considered valid, <em>Porzana olivieri</em> (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakalava_rail), and all the online sources I checked date it to 1929 too.</p>

<p>Conclusion: I am going to treat all of these names as having been published in 1929. Before I give my full response (which will likely be long winded…) I wanted to clarify that the Primate taxonomy has been heavily influenced by Russel Mittermeier and Anthony Rylands decisions in the Handbook of the Mammals of the World and the Illustrated Checklist of the Mammals of the World, both of which I had pretty big gripes about, but given that Primates are a group of considerable conservation concern, I have often opted to include species rather than lump them (although my idea of a species in Cebus would preferable be the four species model at the moment). Considering that I’m trying to move away from using the Handbooks as justification, I am considering making a number of changes to Primate taxonomy, although this would deviate pretty heavily from what the IUCN recognizes, which they keep very good track of taxonomic changes for this group in particular (which the MDD already deviates from on a number of cases). Comments on Primates</p>
<p><em>Lepilemur randrianasoli</em> -&gt; <em>L. randrianasoloi</em> <em>Lepilemur sahamalazensis</em> -&gt; <em>L. sahamalaza</em> (for these two, missed the nomenclatural change)</p>
<p>Also, both <em>Lepilemur aeeclis</em> and <em>L. otto</em> were redescribed as well without changes to their spellings: Craul, M., Zimmermann, E., Rasoloharijaona, S., Randrianambinina, B., &amp; Radespiel, U. (2017). Corrective paper concerning two new species of the genus <em>Lepilemur</em> Geoffroy, 1851 (Mammalia). Dumerilia, 7, 72-77. Andriaholinirina, N., Fausser, J.-L., Roos, C., Zinner, D., Thalmann, U., et al (2017). Corrective paper concerning three new species of the genus Lepilemur Geoffroy, 1851 (Mammalia). Dumerilia, 7, 62–71.</p>
<p><em>Nycticebus pygmaeus</em> -&gt; <em>Xanthonycticebus</em> (though I would have preferred a subgenus) – I actually like this one just because of the name, but yeah, its kind of a redundant split.</p>
<p><em>Lepilemur wrighti</em> vs. <em>wrightae</em> (interestingly you don’t adopt <em>Lepilemur tymerlachsonorum</em>, possibly because it was not directly based on a name) – yeah, it wasn’t, and the HMW commented on this; I followed the HMW spellings for primates pretty closely, which explains this a bit.</p>
<p>Noticed that you did change <em>Chiropotes utahickae</em> to <em>utahicki</em>, citing CMW. I haven’t seen that book so I’m curious what the motivation was. I checked the original description and it was definitely named after a woman. Same for <em>Aotus nancymaae</em> vs. <em>nancymai</em>.</p>
<p>I think this one was pretty heavily discussed a while back when the illustrated checklist was being written (Russell Mittermeier and Anthony Rylands advocated for just this spelling change but not the <em>Lepilemur</em> ones?). That being said, it goes against what I’ve typical done on the MDD, but I’ll leave it for now until we’ve discussed this a bit more.</p>
<p>New World Monkey genera – I’ll do my best to keep this succinct. Overall, all three are kind of subjective decisions (although the <em>Sapajus</em> one is most justified in my opinion) and the greater primatological community has variously rejected and accepted these changes (although its mostly the taxonomists accepting it and the other primatologists rejecting it).</p>
<p><em>Sapajus</em> and <em>Cebus</em> – So, this one where I actually prefer the spilt. It has the strongest evidence given the morphological and behavioral distinctions that are distributed between the two genera monophyletically (unlike in the <em>Lasiurus</em> case in Chiroptera). I think that even in a monophyletic situation, having multiple genera provides a more generalized functionality to the group within reason, especially since genera are a heavily used species organization level despite being poorly defined. Although subgenera are used fairly commonly and I think are useful in describing clades within a genus, I tend to want a group to be recognized as a genus if it has morphological, behavioral, and molecular monophyly that allows for the consistent differentiation from other clades in its family/subfamily/tribe. But that is my personal opinion on how subgenera and genera should be loosely defined, and I think that the recognition of separate genera just to split up monophyletic clades is a flimsy reasoning, as well as the argument that sympatry has anything to do with generic recognition. I also feel that in cases where, at least in mammals, there is evidence of hybridization, they should usually be treated as the same genus (although in the case of delphinids, I would say I’m less strict on this rule given the hybridization between distantly related genera…). I’ll be continuing to recognize <em>Sapajus</em> and <em>Cebus</em> given the more robust justification and that it has become a more commonly used arrangement in many places (although there are still plenty of publications that don’t use it).</p>
<p><em>Cheracebus</em> and <em>Plecturocebus</em> from <em>Callicebus</em> – I’ve continued to recognize this because major conservation organizations continue to use it and there are no papers that currently directly refute this arrangement. The time based generic definition I think is valid, although just based on that alone, I don’t think it’s the best evidence to use for this clade. There are also morphological distinctions between the different genera, although it is mostly based on relative coat pattern consistency within each genus. I don’t think there’s been anything using skull morphometrics to support the different genera, but the authors of the paper I think are overconfident that this arrangement is justified (and in my eyes, it’s not enough). I’m going to continue to recognize this split given that there hasn’t been much push back at this point and that conservation organizations are using this arrangements, but I would like to see more justification of the recognition of these genera as separate.</p>
<p><em>Leontocebus</em>, <em>Oedipomidas</em>, and <em>Tamarinus</em> from <em>Saguinus</em> – <em>Saguinus</em> generic taxonomy makes my head hurt at this point (same with <em>Cebus</em> species recognition, but we’ll get to that below…). I have seen Brcko et al., 2022, but had forgot to look into it more, as I was pretty done with trying to figure out what to do with this group. I have gone back and forth about recognizing <em>Leontocebus</em> as separate and have never recognized <em>Oedipomidas</em> and <em>Tamarinus</em> at this point. This is because of the considerable pushback Garbino’s team has put out has convinced me of the redundancy of these changes. However, following the MDDs rules, the Brcko et al., 2022 paper is the most recent, and it was followed in another revision recently (reference below, I haven’t added this split yet, but I will be). <em>Leontocebus</em> has been adopted by the IUCN but <em>Oedipomidas</em> and <em>Tamarinus</em> have not at this point (although I fell as if they will). I kind of want your input further on this one before I make a decision, but given that I am continuing to recognize the other two generic splits, it seems like I ‘should’ be recognizing these ones, which I disagree with more than the others and have had pushback. If you choose to accept the other two, what do you feel like doing with these genera?</p>

<p>On a side note, we should look into making a publication judging the consistency of how we define mammal genera across different mammal clades… we could get divergence estimates from various papers and build a big dataset for every living genus (it should be mostly available by now? Nate, you have that big phylogeny we can look at too).</p>
<p><em>Alouatta villosa</em> vs. <em>A. pigra</em> (+) – yeah, it’s consistent with the literature at this point, but if you have a good explanation against it though, I’d like to hear it even if we don’t accept it at this point.</p>
<p><em>Lagothrix lagothricha</em> vs. <em>lagotricha</em> (-) – I’ll make the change to match Hesperomys on the MDD.</p>
<p>Callitrichinae vs. Callitrichidae vs. Callithrichidae (?) – This ones another thing I’ve gone back and forth about but have settled on now (although not the spelling…). I originally included Cebidae, Aotidae, and Callitrichidae in a single family and was planning on doing so in the illustrated checklist, but Russell Mittermeier and Anthony Rylands were persistent in their opinion of recognizing them as separate families rather than a single family. After thinking about it a bit, I do agree with them, especially given that I recognize Sminthidae and Zapodidae as separate from Dipodidae. I’m motivated to keep them as separate because of their distinct ecologies, considerable morphological distinctions, and divergence times, which are consistent with family recognition in a number of other mammalian clades. However, in a similar case to genera, this is pretty subjective, as there is not a completely set upon definition of a family. I think the definition of families in the platyrrhines is different then what we’ve done for the catarrhines and it kind of bugs me, as we should be consistent at least within the same order. This is because the species diversity between these two clades are similar with similar crown group divergence times and morphological/ecological diversity, but we still call Cercopithecidae a single family and recognize 3-5 families of platyrrhines.</p>
<p>For the spelling, I think it comes down to what the oldest name for the group was, which is Callitrichidae Gray, 1821 (under I think as a subfamily name?) over Callithrichidae Thomas, 1903 (he might have spelt it Callitrhicidae). However, I don’t think name priority is completely based on age at the family level according to the code and I also don’t think it matters whether the name was first used as a subfamily, family, or tribe, it still can be moved between those levels and have the same authority (I’m not as well versed on family name usage, but if the name Callitrichinae was first used at the subfamily level, it still has priority over later names describing the same clade at the family and tribal level, but the ending just changes to -idae or -inae; I think the same goes for superfamily too). Callitrichidae/Callitrichinae is the most commonly used spelling at this point, so I’ve retained it to avoid confusion at this point. I’d like to hear more about your opinion with it though. I’m going to keep my spelling for now.</p>
<p><em>Cebus</em> sensu stricto (-) – Jane Widness and I gripe about this a lot… I’ve used the HMW taxonomy for the genus because Russell had me use it in the illustrated checklist and the IUCN recognizes something close to this arrangement. But I REALLY hate this arrangement and would like to go back to a four species arrangement for now, which I think I will do unless someone has a problem with it.</p>
<p><em>Lophocebus</em> species (-) – This was a weird one that Russell and Anthony actually wanted to lump, which is not normal for him. Regardless, I will add the species back for now until something comes out going against this arrangement.</p>
<p><em>Piliocolobus lulindicus</em> (-) – Another one added based on comments from Russel and Anthony with no justification; will be removing it.</p>
<p><em>Microcebus mittermeieri</em> (-) – Russell and Anthony wanted to keep it, I wanted it removed and initially had it removed. Will be removing it.</p>
<p><em>Avahi ramanantsoavani</em> vs. <em>ramanantsoavanai</em> (-) – I will make the change to match Hesperomys on the MDD.</p>
<p><em>Cacajao</em> – yeah, this one was not fun at all and there are multiple people still going back and forth about it. I chose to just go with what Russell and Anthony wanted for this group (they gave me a LONG email explanation about their decision). The distributions were switched around and the names moved in various directions, and I think the MDD has the arrangement and distribution ‘correct’ for what we decided to follow at this point.</p>

<p>Yes, I got those too, along with articles in the same issue about <em>Arabitragus</em>/<em>Nilgiritragus</em> and the tribes of Murinae. I believe those aren’t relevant to the MDD since you’re not tracking authorship above the species level. Thanks for pointing the way.</p>

<p>Thanks for writing this up, this is very useful context. I think my hesitance about these changes comes from the idea that scientific names are a tool of communication for everyone working with these animals, not just taxonomists but also ecologists, conservationists, zookeepers, etc. Every time a taxonomic name changes, these people may have to adapt to new names when the old ones may have served perfectly fine for communication. As taxonomists, we have a metaphorical budget of name changes we can unleash until the non-taxonomists get rightfully annoyed about all those constantly changing names. If we use that budget for a change that reflects a real improvement in our knowledge about the relationships of some animal (as with <em>Cercopithecus dryas</em> being moved to <em>Chlorocebus</em>), that’s a good use of the budget. But if the changes don’t reflect an improvement in systematic knowledge, it’s not a good use. In my mind, genus-level changes that don’t fix non-monophyly generally don’t meet the bar, since there are no widely accepted objective criteria for genus delimitation (other than monophyly). But at some point, if the change becomes widely enough accepted, resisting it is itself going to cause more confusion, so I’m open to adapting these new genera if they are likely to be widely accepted. For example, I initially rejected <em>Nesogale</em> as a separate genus when I read the paper proposing it, but accepted it when I saw that HMW had accepted the split.</p>
<p>At this point, the <em>Sapajus</em> split is probably sufficiently widely accepted that I will accept it. The titi split is a bit more recent but has also been accepted fairly widely, so I will follow suit.</p>
<p>For the tamarins, if your policy is to follow the latest taxonomic revision, I do think that implies you should go and recognize all four genera. But given that the two-genus classification received published pushback and the four-genus classification is still fairly recent, I personally think it makes sense to wait a bit. If you do decide to accept these genera I’ll probably follow just for consistency.</p>

<p>Yes, that would be very interesting! Applying a consistent divergence-time criterion to all mammals would be a good exercise. Goodman et al. (1998) tried to do that for primates, but molecular methods have advanced a lot since.</p>
<p>A related project I’ve been thinking about is to review all known cases of nonmonophyly at the generic level and suggest solutions or avenues for further research.</p>

<p>I felt Brandon-Jones did a pretty good job of showing the identity of the <em>villosa</em> type and the subsequent literature didn’t really refute his arguments. I may not have read closely enough though.</p>

However, in a similar case to genera, this is pretty subjective, as there is not a completely set upon definition of a family. I think the definition of families in the platyrrhines is different then what we’ve done for the catarrhines and it kind of bugs me, as we should be consistent at least within the same order. This is because the species diversity between these two clades are similar with similar crown group divergence times and morphological/ecological diversity, but we still call Cercopithecidae a single family and recognize 3-5 families of platyrrhines.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That makes sense and I’ll switch to the three-family arrangement. My only worry is that most of the platyrrhine literature (or at least the papers I was reading yesterday) currently puts them in a single family. It’ll be worth checking in every so often to see if it remains that way.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the spelling, I think it comes down to what the oldest name for the group was, which is Callitrichidae Gray, 1821 (under I think as a subfamily name?) over Callithrichidae Thomas, 1903 (he might have spelt it Callitrhicidae). However, I don’t think name priority is completely based on age at the family level according to the code and I also don’t think it matters whether the name was first used as a subfamily, family, or tribe, it still can be moved between those levels and have the same authority (I’m not as well versed on family name usage, but if the name Callitrichinae was first used at the subfamily level, it still has priority over later names describing the same clade at the family and tribal level, but the ending just changes to -idae or -inae; I think the same goes for superfamily too). Callitrichidae/Callitrichinae is the most commonly used spelling at this point, so I’ve retained it to avoid confusion at this point. I’d like to hear more about your opinion with it though. I’m going to keep my spelling for now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My understanding is that for family-group names the original spelling doesn’t usually matter: the name is to be formed by adding a suffix to the stem (Art. 29.3), so even if the original author got the stem wrong, you should still use the correct stem. But I see now that Art. 29.5 says that if a form with incorrect stem is in prevailing usage, it is to be maintained. And clearly the Callitrich- forms are in prevailing usage, so I’ll drop the h.</p>
<p>By the way, there’s an additional complication here in that for much of the 19th century, <em>Callithrix</em> was misapplied to the titis, and the marmosets were called <em>Hapale</em>. Thomas (1903) fixed that and renamed the titis <em>Callicebus</em>. That’s why, even though Gray (1821) introduced the name “Callitricidae”, the family-group name for marmosets is correctly attributed to Thomas (1903), who used “Callitrichidae”: Gray’s name is technically based not on <em>Callithrix</em> Erxleben, 1777 (the marmosets), but on <em>Callithrix</em> Geoffroy, 1812 (a junior homonym that was applied to the titis). If you find that confusing, I don’t blame you. Quick note on higher level taxa. I do plan on adding pages specifically for higher level taxa and their synonyms, but hadn’t got there yet as we’ve focused mostly on species. So, in the future, we will be adding them and dealing with those intricacies a bit more.</p>
<p>I’m also going to continue not to recognize the Saguinus splits for the time being and add some comments on it to the MDD. I’m really looking forward to the publication of the third volume of the Mammals of South America to see how they decide to handle the taxonomy of neotropical primates, as I’m sure I’ll be taking on whatever arrangement they choose in the long run. Plagiodontia spelaeum &lt; P. araeum – reference comment noted.</p>
<p>Tympanoctomys aureus -&gt; Pipanacoctomys aureus – I also hope the paper is published at some point, as it’d give me a better reference to sort as well.</p>
<p>Cryptomys (+) – I’ll move the synonyms you suggested; I originally just neglected to do so because it was a lot of work at the time to track them down (now I have the resources to do it, but hadn’t done so yet). I original only recognized a single species in the genus, but it became apparent that a lot of places were recognizing the 5 species model, so I decided to cave and use it even though it’s definitely provisional at this point. Also noted your typo comment.</p>
<p>Heliophobius kapiti (-) – I had seen the paper but I had assumed that like a lot of recent papers on the genus, they suggested a revision was needed without making a revision itself; I think I will go ahead and follow this change given that they provide okay evidence and actually state that they are suggesting a two species model.</p>
<p>Hydrochoerus – I had not seen the paper, at least I don’t remember seeing it. But it looks like the two species will likely be subsumed into one, but that hasn’t been done yet. Given that the data is also mostly based on mtDNA at this point, I wouldn’t feel comfortable lumping them yet, especially since the papers don’t fully suggest it either. I’ll add a comment about it on the MDD; Byrne, M.S., Ruiz-García, M. and Túnez, J.I. 2021. Phylogeography of the capybara, Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris, in a large portion of its distribution area in South America. Journal of Mammalian Evolution 29(1):191-206. doi:10.1007/s10914-021-09569-2</p>
<p>Pediolagus (MDD) vs. Dolichotis (Hesp) (-) – given the fossil paper, I think I’ll go ahead and lump Pediolagus back into Dolichotis, especially given that it really didn’t have a lot of support in the first place in my opinion: Madozzo-Jaén, M.C., Pérez, M.E. and Deschamps, C.M. 2021. The oldest species of Dolichotis (Rodentia, Hystricognathi) from the Pliocene of Argentina: Redescription and taxonomic status of “Orthomyctera” chapalmalense. Journal of Mammalian Evolution 28(3):995-1013. doi:10.1007/s10914-021-09559-4</p>
<p>Brotomys contractus (-) – I will go ahead and add the species back. I haven’t been sure what to do with some of these fossil/subfossil species because their taxonomy is less commonly addressed.</p>
<p>Heteropsomys antillensis (-) – I’ll add the species back as well.</p>
<p>Hyperplagiodontia araeum (MDD) vs. araea (Hesp) (+) – we should probably try to confirm this one further, especially given that -odontia is generally treated as feminine.</p>
<p>Makalata obscura (MDD) vs. Loncheres obscura (Hesp) (-) – although the taxon is suggested to be either a nomen dubium or a synonym of M. didelphoides, the fact that it was still included as a species in the Mammals of South America and the HMW series makes me want to retain it for the time being. I don’t currently have access to Miranda et al., 2021 (if you have it, I’d love to see it), but have had access in the past and though it just said the species status is uncertain rather than keeping it as a nomen dubium. The type specimen is lost, so it looks like it will either be lumped into another Makalata species or treated as a nomen dubium, so once I see the paper, I may remove it.</p>
<p>Mesocapromys nana (MDD) vs. nanus (Hesp) (+) – oooh, I had completely forgot about this decision… I’m going to have to bring this up with the Bat Names group too since they suggested nanus for Afronycteris nanus too. This was discovered during the creation of HMW6 and was not reflected for Mazama nana. But I think this is something to publish on nonetheless, so lets add this to the list of problematic mammal names. Also, I’ll keep a note about changing Afronycteris nanus to nana and Mazama nana to nanus (and I’ll check to see if there’re any other cases, but I’m assuming you’ve already done so).</p>
<p>For <em>nana</em>/<em>nanus</em>, you can see the list of names using this suffix at http://hesperomys.com/sc/31. I looked again and there is one other valid extant mammal that is affected: <em>Cercartetus nanus</em> was originally <em>Phalangista nana</em>. There are also a couple of turtle names in my database with the same problem, but that’s out of scope here. Somewhat separately <em>Cervus nanus</em> may be preoccupied by some fossil deer named by Kaup, but I haven’t yet tracked down the original description. I will go ahead and remove Makalata obscura, given that it is considered a nomen dubium by most sources lately (although listed as a species for some reason). It’s funny cause I also though Sciurids were a lot more consistent than other mammal groups until I actually dove into them, finding that they have some of the least studied groups in some cases (e.g., South-east Asian squirrels at this point). Lots of work to be done here!</p>
<p>Urocitellus endemicus -&gt; U. brunneus – just wanted to briefly comment that I’m working with Bryan Mclean at the moment to revise the small-eared group of Urocitellus, and these two species still are not showing up as distinct (we’re splitting idahoensis from mollis though, so still ending up with two endemics in Idaho, where I’m from!).</p>
<p>Dremomys ornatus &lt; D. rufigenis – I recognize this change for the time being, but Arlo Hinckley let me know that they’re also working on revising Dremomys and have found that although these are distinct species, Abramov did not compare type localities and that one of the other names actually applies to what is currently labeled D. ornatus. Just waiting for him to publish it at this point.</p>
<p>Petaurista lena &lt; P. alborufus Petaurista albiventer &lt; P. petaurista Petaurista caniceps, P. marica, P. sibylla &lt; P. elegans Petaurista grandis, P. hainana, P. yunnanensis &lt; P. philippiensis (I’m accepting your Petaurista classification as it reflects the recent literature, but I feel there’s a lot more work to be done and there will be more changes)</p>
<ul>
<li>Petaurista was the group I initially wanted to do my PhD work on and I’m still trying to find a way to do it for my postdoc (although it’s not looking likely). I spent a good bit of time coming up with the current species listing back when I was 18, but it’s still SUPER rough and the genus needs a considerable amount of revision before I feel comfortable sitting on any taxonomic arrangement. Really cool group with some pretty considerable uncertainty at the moment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Otospermophilus douglasii &lt; O. beecheyi (exciting to learn that we have two different ground squirrel species in the Bay Area) – It definitely is! Although I had a hard time wanting to make this change initially because it was kind of unclear in the papers that made it. Jane and I had a pretty long discussion about it.</p>
<p>Callosciurinae (MDD) vs. Nannosciurinae (Hesp) (-) – leaving it for now but DEFINITELY publish on this when you get the chance (either in the big planned taxonomic name publication or separately since it’s kind of a unique/big one).</p>
<p>Sciurus robinsoni alacris – noting this so I can make the change on our synonym listing.</p>
<p>Genera of Sciurini (-) – This is one of the ‘fun’ ones I’ve been waiting for… I’m leaving the generic revision as it currently is on mine given that we don’t really have a practical way to leave species unassigned at the generic level and because I don’t feel comfortable making the change based on the current suggestive language used in the publications. I have talked with Abreu-Júnior about this, as he brought it up with us during the ASM Biodiversity Committee Meeting (which I advise you to attend this year!) and he was saying they were working on publishing a more authoritative revision at the generic level akin to what Helgen did with Spermophilus in 2009. I’ve decided to wait for the genus level revision until then in hopes that they described the new genus and provide morphological support and diagnoses for their different genera, which at the time are not easily diagnosable (especially with the movement of Microsciurus species all over the place). I think they could’ve settled on a less genus rich classification that reflects morphology/ecology a bit better, but ultimately, if it stick in the Neotropics, it’ll stick in North America, although the movement of all North American species out of Sciurus is certainly going to peeve a lot of mammalogists off. Especially since they are some of the most charismatic and well known North American mammals (other then some of the ungulates and carnivores). So for now, leaving it, but will definitely be changing it the second a more comprehensive revision is published (and I suggest you leave your classification as is, as it will eventually be the same on the MDD); this was a decision Jane, Nate, and I had a pretty long conversation about (I in support of the change, Jane against it) and we settled on retaining it for now.</p>
<p>Microsciurus species (-) – Although I didn’t follow the taxonomic changes in the Mammals of South America and Abreu-Júnior et al., 2020 because of the confusion surrounding where different species go, I think I will go ahead and make the suggested species changes to the MDD to match Hesperomys, as I don’t see much problem in doing so (especially since a lot of them are followed now in the Neotropics). Making a note to change it now for Microsciurus.</p>
<p>Guerlinguetus species (-) – will be making the species level changes associated with this genus but leaving them under Sciurus.</p>
<p>Simosciurus species (-) – will be making the species level changes associated with this genus but leaving them under Sciurus.</p>
<p>Sciurus/Hadrosciurus sanborni (-) – will be making the species level changes associated with this genus but leaving them under Sciurus.</p>
<p>Spermophilus alashanicus (MDD) vs. alaschanicus (Hesp) (-!) – will make the change in the MDD to match Hesperomys and the original spelling.</p>
<p>Thanks for the replies! A couple followups:</p>
<p><em>Dremomys</em>: I did notice that the type localities for <em>adamsoni</em> and <em>opimus</em> are suspiciously close to the range of “<em>Dremomys ornatus</em>”. Looking forward to seeing a new revision here.</p>
<p>Pubications/Nannosciurinae: I think after we’re done with these comparisons we can talk with Nate about what kind of publications can come out of this work. There’s probably room for several: species name spellings (maybe several, e.g. patronym emendations, gender agreement, other emendations); genus boundaries; family-group nomenclature changes like this one.</p>
<p>Sciurini: Makes sense that you’re sticking with your arrangement for now. I’ll try to make it so species like <em>flaviventer</em> show up in my database as <em>“Microsciurus” flaviventer</em> instead of <em>Macroxus flaviventer</em>, which will make things a bit easier to compare. My comments for Supramyomorpha:</p>
<p>Lemmus amurensis, L. sibiricus -&gt; L. lemmus – This decision will be overturned by a recent paper respiting them out: Abramson, N., Petrova, T., &amp; Dokuchaev, N. (2022). Analysis of “historical” DNA of museum samples resolve taxonomic, nomenclature and biogeography issues: case study of true lemmings. Biological Communications, 67(4), 340-348.</p>
<p>11 Tachyoryctes spp. -&gt; Tachyoryctes splendens (though I find it really difficult to believe there are only two Tachyoryctes species) – I think this is a pretty tentative arrangement and doubt it will hold for long, since I think Tachyoryctes likely represents a number of species.</p>
<p>Alexandromys alpinus &lt; A. mongolicus (though I agree with your concern that the name is unavailable: the main text of the article doesn’t have sufficient information to make the name available, and the supplement isn’t a valid publication under the Code) – Yeah, need to contact the authors about it, but I’m recognizing it for now. I actually just found out that a species of Murina is unavailable too (Murina rangjiangensis), but I’ll have to comment on that elsewhere.</p>
<p>Antillomys rayi – this name is also unavailable, having been described in the supplemental material. However, I recently reviewed a paper redescribing it in Therya, which will make it available soon.</p>
<p>Heteromys (MDD) vs. Liomys, Schaeferia (Hesp) (+) – I’ll be sure to add some sort of comments related to the different arrangement, but the single genus view seems to have stuck.</p>
<p>Sminthidae (MDD) vs. Sicistidae (Hesp) (-) – I will leave it for now, but you are likely correct. I think there as been some discussion on the matter, but in vague terms.</p>
<p>Sicista tianshanica (-!) – I actually just made the change based on comments from the Lynx Edicions team who recently discovered it too; but I did not make the year change, so I will do so.</p>
<p>6 additional species of Napaeozapus and Zapus (-) – I’ve gone back and forth with this one because Jason Malaney is my lab and we’ve talked about it a good bit. But I think I will go back on it for now, because it hasn’t really got a lot of external support and probably needs to be more strictly stated as a revision.</p>
<p>Anteliomys custos c(h)angs(h)anensis (-) – I haven’t got access to the original description at this point, but I’d assume you’re probably correct. I’ll leave this for when we go through synonyms.</p>
<p>Myodes/Clethrionomys (+) – looking forward to your contributions to this! It’s one that everyone is annoyed about changing back and forth.</p>
<p>Chionomys syriacus (MDD) vs. C. nivalis (Hesp) (-!) – Hadn’t realized this! Will change it back!</p>
<p>Neotoma nelsoni (+) – definitely going to need more work here as well. I don’t think I have any comments about this on the MDD though, so I’ll add that.</p>
<p>Peromyscus arcticus (-) – I am going to remove the species and add comments about it under P. maniculatus.</p>
<p>Peromyscus totontepecus – I think you’re right about this, but I’m going to leave the name for now and add comments about tehuantepecus likely being the oldest name for this species.</p>
<p>Oxymycterus caparoae (MDD) vs. Oxymycterus caparaoe (Hesp) (-!) – will make this change!</p>
<p>Hylaeamys laticeps and H. seuanezi (-) – I remember this one confusing me a lot, but I understand now why. I hadn’t realized it was about where to place laticeps. I’ll follow your taxonomy.</p>
<p>Phyllotis rupestris (-) – Hmm, I hadn’t realized this. I’m going to do some more investigation over the next few days, but may choose to go with your conclusion in the end. Phyllotis is a rough genus at the moment.</p>
<p>Rhipidomys bezerrensis and R. caracolensis (-) – I don’t know why I added these species so prematurely… I can’t decide whether to leave them with comments to them being in pre-publication or remove them yet. Because I’m sure they’ll be described soon and removing them for one version seems a bit ridiculous, but I generally wouldn’t add them until they were officially described.</p>
<p>Thamnomys (MDD) vs. Grammomys (Hesp) (-) – hadn’t seen this change, will make the change.</p>
<p>Hydromys and Uromys neobritannicus (MDD) vs. neobrittanicus (Hesp) (-) – will make the change on the MDD to match Hesperomys.</p>
<p>Hylomyscus kaimosae (-) – Hmm, I don’t know how I ended up recognizing it. I’ll go ahead and remove it but I need to check what the HMW series did with this species.</p>
<p>Myomyscus verreauxii (MDD) vs. verreauxi (Hesp) (-) – so the issue here is whether one or two ‘I’s is used? I’m really not sure what wins here, but I’ll change to the Hesperomys spelling for now, as it has more justification from what I’m seeing.</p>
<p>Dendromus melanotis (MDD) vs. Poemys melanotis (Hesp) (-) – I will move melanotis from Dendromus to Poemys.</p>
<p>Thanks! I’ll look into changing <em>Lemmus</em> again based on the reference you mentioned.</p>
<p>It makes sense to keep the two <em>Rhipidomys</em> since they’ll almost certainly become formally available soon. Another comment here. I decided not to include Perognathus arizonensis as recent literature hasn’t taken up this change since McKnight, 2005. If you have any recent literature that’s followed it, let me know. I’m sure it’ll be accepted eventually, but more research is needed (I’ve heard Jim Patton was looking into this group recently). Sounds good. I’ll do a literature check tonight to confirm, but you’re probably right. After you publish the next MDD update I’ll check for taxonomic differences again and probably mostly change Hesperomys to follow MDD. A quick note of Hylaeamys laticeps/seuanezi. Looks like the Mammals of South America in 2015 recognized laticeps as a species including seuanezi, appearing to have misinterpreted the results of Brennand et al., 2013. This was then followed by a number of subsequent authors, which made me confused about what the actual arrangement should have been (I had thought they were to be treated as distinct species, which didn’t make since given that there was no evidence of two different species within what is now H. seuanezi and previously H. laticeps). MSA2 appears to have thought that Brennand et al., 2013 was saying that laticeps and seuanezi were distinct species, neither being synonymous with H. megacephalus, so they retained both under a single species as a result. However, Brennand et al., 2013 included laticeps (and saltator) under H. megacephalus because the type material of both laticeps and megacephalus clustered together morphologically to the exclusion of the populations previously attributed to H. laticeps. As a result, seuanezi was then the oldest name applicable to those populations since laticeps was best treated as a synonym of H. megacephalus following the analyses. I had been unaware of this because the paper trail was obscured and misinterpreted by later publications, which is always rough! I noticed another discrepancy (missed previously because the species is marked as extinct in my database): <em>Oryzomys peninsulae</em>, which I have as valid and you list as a synonym of <em>couesi</em>. Recognition as a species follows: Carleton, M.D. and Arroyo-Cabrales, J. 2009. Review of the <em>Oryzomys couesi</em> complex (Rodentia: Cricetidae: Sigmodontinae) in western Mexico. Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History 331:94-127. doi:10.1206/582-3.1 HDL 2246/6035</p>
<p>Is this comparing strictly to the species dataset downloadable online? I’ll be sure to note these. Before we move to the synonym list, I think we should have a Zoom call discuss how best to deal with them. Yes, this is the online downloadable dataset. I took a brief look at the names file you shared and it does seem a formidable task that we should discuss over Zoom first. Probably we should do something like this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Match up all names, figuring out anything that’s missing in either database. I think my database has looser inclusion criteria around nomina nuda, bad spellings, etc., so we’ll have to come up with a way to filter the Hesperomys data to match your criteria.</li>
<li>Deal with any cases where a name is assigned to a different taxon (hopefully the taxonomic comparison will take care of most of these, but there may be some left).</li>
<li>Try to match up any other fields, depending on which ones we’re most interested in (author, year, type locality, type specimen, citation, etc.). I went through and matched as many synonym names as I could based on the original lists (although there are certainly some mistakes), so that most of the MDD names with matches have an ID number that corresponds on there to the ones on your database. I’m also updating the MDD taxonomy on that spreadsheet, so that we would be able to directly match them in your new taxonomy. We’ll need to definitely talk about this in zoom, but ultimately, I think we’ll be mostly taking your dataset (with exception to those that we have that you don’t), as you have most of ours, and it is better vetted at this point. Some more on authors. This is still only for valid species, not for all names. I looked only at names where the number of authors is different between our databases. On my side this helped me fix a number of cases where I had the wrong author list; the following are the cases where I think MDD got it wrong:</li>

<li>MDD skips author Hoang Trung Thanh. Also, the last author is spelled “Hasanin” in MDD.

<p>I’m working on incorporating your comments still, but I’ll be sure to fix these! Commenting back on some of the spelling changes you suggested that I’m either not making for the MDD or am skeptical of and need clarification:</p>
<p>Cephalophus silvicultor vs. silvicultrix (-) – Agreed that the name is originally spelt ‘silvicultrix’ but Grubb, 2004 treats the name as an adjective, which is also considered an adjective here: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/silvicultrix (I know, Wikipedia isn’t the best place to go, but I think it’s applicable here). However, in agreement with having it be silvicultrix, it is a third-declension adjective, which would mean it does not change to with the generic gender. However, it may be in prevailing usage, which would put a wrench in using silvicultrix. The last publication I can find that used silvicultrix spelt it ‘sylvicultrix’, it was St. Leger, 1936, Proc. Zool. Soc. London and Allen’s African Mammal Book used ‘silvicultor’. Using Google Scholar also only brings of 12 results for ‘Cephalophus silvicultrix’ and 48 for ‘Cephalophus sylvicultrix’, so it may be a good argument to say its in prevailing use. Grubb, P. (2004). Controversial scientific names of African mammals. African Zoology, 39(1), 91-109.</p>
<p>Globicephala macrorhyncha vs. macrorhynchus (-) – I’m not to sure which it really is personally (I need to find a good source to base my assumptions of ‘noun in apposition vs. adjective’ on), but Rice, 1977 states the following: “The specific name is usually spelled macrorhyncha, but it is a noun in apposition, not an adjective, so must retain its original gender.” So I’m assuming this is the publication that shifted the name from ‘macrorhyncha’ to ‘macrorhynchus’ based on the assumption that it is a noun in apposition and must match the original spelling. I also think that it’s been pretty well established in the marine mammal community at this point, so I think it should stay as macrorhynchus to avoid confusion within that community. Rice, D. W. (1977). A list of the marine mammals of the world (Vol. 711). Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service.</p>
<p>Myoictis wavica vs. wavicus (-) – I wasn’t able to find a single publication that’s ever used ‘wavica’, but it does seem to be an adjective derived from a noun as you suggested. It’s essentially in prevailing use to use wavicus, so I don’t really think it’s okay to change it. I went to the r/Latin subreddit for some advice and got the following response, which makes me lean in the direction of interpreting it as a noun since there is no etymology section in the original description and it was under a feminine genus when described: “I think you are correct in saying that the epithet wavicus is adjectival if it is indeed using the suffix -icus meaning”belonging to“. However, if there is any way that the name can be interpreted as a noun AND the original usage was ambiguous as to whether it should be treated as a noun or an adjective (meaning the etymology section doesn’t specify, but since this is 1947 taxonomy, I’m guessing it doesn’t), then by the ICZN the name is to be treated as a noun and the specific epithet retains the -us ending regardless of the gender of the generic name. The fact that the original combination used -icus and not -ica with a feminine genus could be interpreted as intention for the name to be used as a noun but again that is only if the name can possibly be interpreted as a noun or an adjective.”</p>
<p>Caluromysiops irrupta vs. irruptus (-) – Same issues as M. wavicus/wavica, but I’m less certain about the intentional use of irrupta (haven’t looked at it het); regardless, I don’t think it should be changed given the long standing use of irrupta.</p>
<p>Lagothrix lagothricha vs. lagotricha (-) – I agree that ‘lagotricha’ is likely the correct spelling given that it’s the earlier name in the original publication and that it seems to be more grammatically correct (could be wrong about that though), but the paper that made the change was Fooden, 1963, which stated the following: “In Humboldt’s (1812) original publication, the name of this species is spelled lagotricha on page 322 and lagothricha on page 354. The spelling lagothricha is adopted here as the correct original spelling, in accordance with Article 32b and Article 24a(i) of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (Stoll et al., eds., 1961).” This was based on an earlier version of the code, but I wanted to know what you thought about this before I fully decided on the change. Fooden, J. (1963). A revision of the woolly monkeys (genus Lagothrix). Journal of Mammalogy, 44(2), 213-247.</p>
<p>Hipposideros swinhoei vs. swinhoii (-) – Looked into this one a bit further and I think it’s in prevailing use at this point. Hill, 1963 suggested that swinhoei was the correct spelling, although he did not reference and earlier work that suggested the spelling emendation before him. I’m linking to the page in Hill, 1963 that suggests the use of swinhoei, which is probably an unjustified emendation that has become the more used spelling. I’m not to sure what to do about at this point though, because I haven’t found any significant publications using the ‘swinhoii’ spelling. If you have any more insight or other publications, I’d love to see them. Currently asking BatNames what they think too. https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/2340818</p>
<p>Desmalopex leucoptera and microleucoptera vs. leucopterus (-) – I think we should stick with the masculine forms for now personally; the feminine forms have never been used to my understanding and prevailing use might be argued in this case.</p>
<p>Nyctimene minuta vs. N. varius (+/-) – Given the universal treatment of Nyctimene as masculine, I would rather leave varius as masculine rather than feminine for now; but if you feel strongly about this one, it should be published and discussed more.</p>
<p>Pteropus vetula vs. P. vetulus (+) – I would also argue for prevailing use at this point… I’ll bring it up with Batnames to see what they say.</p>
<p>Crocidura greenwoodae vs greenwoodi – will be changing this one back to greenwoodi after some conversations with someone at the IUCN (haven’t decided on what to do with the rest of the -orum additions we’ve talked about but whatever Batnames decides for Pteropus gilliardorum will guide my answer there).</p>
<p>Sorex monticolus vs. S. monticola (-) – I think I’m going to follow you in this and go with monticolus now, as you seem to be write.</p>
<p>Suncus varilla vs. S. varillus (-) – I think I’ll actually stick with the original spelling of varilla for this one for now because it is ambiguous and I’d rather treat it as a noun until more information is available.</p>

<p>Thanks, wasn’t aware of that listing of the word as an adjective. Apparently it only appears once in a Catullus poem. Agree that at this point there’s a reasonable argument to be made to treat <em>silvicultor</em> as a justified emendation through prevailing usage. I will make this change.</p>

<p>It seems like an adjective to me, but in general this is a very ambiguous area. I am going to stick with the adjectival form for now but will think about this more.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This and <em>Caluromysiops</em>, <em>Nyctimene</em>, <em>Desmalopex</em> below are similar situations where following grammar rules strictly would go against prevailing usage. I am going to stick with the corrected forms for now but this is worth thinking about more.</p>
<p>We’ll likely see more such cases when we compare the two databases again, as I ran some checks that corrected a number of additional cases of gender misalignment.</p>
<p>Also just wanted to note that in <em>Vandeleuria</em> you <em>did</em> accept a gender correction based on historical data that clearly went against prevailing usage. <em>Kerivoula</em> is actually also masculine by the same argument as was used for <em>Vandeleuria</em>, which would be even more disruptive.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Thanks, I hadn’t noticed that Humboldt also used the <em>lagothricha</em> spelling. In this case, it makes sense to accept Fooden’s paper as a First Reviser action and use the <em>lagothricha</em> spelling. I am making this change.</p>

<p>There’s probably a good argument for prevailing usage here yes. Just to add some data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allen (1938:192) used <em>swinhoii</em>: Allen, G.M. 1938. The mammals of China and Mongolia. Part 1. Natural History of Central Asia 11(1):1-620.</li>
<li>Dobson (1878:135) was probably the first to use <em>swinhoei</em>: Dobson, G.E. 1878-06-15. Catalogue of the Chiroptera in the Collection of the British Museum. Taylor and Francis, British Museum Catalogue, 567 pp.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sorry for the misleading citation of Hill (1963) in my earlier message; I must have missed the place where says <em>swinhoei</em> is “more correct”.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes, I think it’s worth thinking about all of these and treating them in a similar way. In addition to the cases I brought up there are a few more similar ones among fossils, synonyms, etc. <em>Vespadelus douglasorum</em> was originally <em>douglasi</em>. I’m testing if I reply over email on my phone if it’ll post on GitHub…</p>
<p>Just a quick comment on the Vandeleuria example, I think I’d like to revert that one for consistency with the others. I’m also talking to Batnames about reverting Pteropus vetula back to vetulus. Honestly, these spelling issues are the worst because they’re endless! They’re taking up most of my time as I try to update the MDD, but it’s kind of good because I’m a lot more familiar with these decisions and Latin now.</p>

<p>Just a quick comment on the Vandeleuria example, I think I’d like to revert that one for consistency with the others. I’m also talking to Batnames about reverting Pteropus vetula back to vetulus. Honestly, these spelling issues are the worst because they’re endless! They’re taking up most of my time as I try to update the MDD, but it’s kind of good because I’m a lot more familiar with these decisions and Latin now.</p>

<p>Commenting back on some of the spelling changes you suggested that I’m either not making for the MDD or am skeptical of and need clarification:</p>
<p>Cephalophus silvicultor vs. silvicultrix (-) – Agreed that the name is originally spelt ‘silvicultrix’ but Grubb, 2004 treats the name as an adjective, which is also considered an adjective here: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/silvicultrix <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/silvicultrix__;!!IKRxdwAv5BmarQ!b878SwkAx834drR6PVLLFS5LzP5kKkC07wYlJyXfR1OO4ZY_q-0FDNiYw8XI89wRKWbFrJc8-E7qKO4HNy0KohrtMag$" class="uri">https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/silvicultrix__;!!IKRxdwAv5BmarQ!b878SwkAx834drR6PVLLFS5LzP5kKkC07wYlJyXfR1OO4ZY_q-0FDNiYw8XI89wRKWbFrJc8-E7qKO4HNy0KohrtMag$</a> (I know, Wikipedia isn’t the best place to go, but I think it’s applicable here). However, in agreement with having it be silvicultrix, it is a third-declension adjective, which would mean it does not change to with the generic gender. However, it may be in prevailing usage, which would put a wrench in using silvicultrix. The last publication I can find that used silvicultrix spelt it ‘sylvicultrix’, it was St. Leger, 1936, Proc. Zool. Soc. London and Allen’s African Mammal Book used ‘silvicultor’. Using Google Scholar also only brings of 12 results for ‘Cephalophus silvicultrix’ and 48 for ‘Cephalophus sylvicultrix’, so it may be a good argument to say its in prevailing use. Grubb, P. (2004). Controversial scientific names of African mammals. African Zoology, 39(1), 91-109.</p>
<p>Thanks, wasn’t aware of that listing of the word as an adjective. Apparently it only appears once in a Catullus poem. Agree that at this point there’s a reasonable argument to be made to treat <em>silvicultor</em> as a justified emendation through prevailing usage. I will make this change.</p>
<p>Globicephala macrorhyncha vs. macrorhynchus (-) – I’m not to sure which it really is personally (I need to find a good source to base my assumptions of ‘noun in apposition vs. adjective’ on), but Rice, 1977 states the following: “The specific name is usually spelled macrorhyncha, but it is a noun in apposition, not an adjective, so must retain its original gender.” So I’m assuming this is the publication that shifted the name from ‘macrorhyncha’ to ‘macrorhynchus’ based on the assumption that it is a noun in apposition and must match the original spelling. I also think that it’s been pretty well established in the marine mammal community at this point, so I think it should stay as macrorhynchus to avoid confusion within that community. Rice, D. W. (1977). A list of the marine mammals of the world (Vol. 711). Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service.</p>
<p>It seems like an adjective to me, but in general this is a very ambiguous area. I am going to stick with the adjectival form for now but will think about this more.</p>
<p>Myoictis wavica vs. wavicus (-) – I wasn’t able to find a single publication that’s ever used ‘wavica’, but it does seem to be an adjective derived from a noun as you suggested. It’s essentially in prevailing use to use wavicus, so I don’t really think it’s okay to change it. I went to the r/Latin subreddit for some advice and got the following response, which makes me lean in the direction of interpreting it as a noun since there is no etymology section in the original description and it was under a feminine genus when described: “I think you are correct in saying that the epithet wavicus is adjectival if it is indeed using the suffix -icus meaning”belonging to“. However, if there is any way that the name can be interpreted as a noun AND the original usage was ambiguous as to whether it should be treated as a noun or an adjective (meaning the etymology section doesn’t specify, but since this is 1947 taxonomy, I’m guessing it doesn’t), then by the ICZN the name is to be treated as a noun and the specific epithet retains the -us ending regardless of the gender of the generic name. The fact that the original combination used -icus and not -ica with a feminine genus could be interpreted as intention for the name to be used as a noun but again that is only if the name can possibly be interpreted as a noun or an adjective.”</p>
<p>This and <em>Caluromysiops</em>, <em>Nyctimene</em>, <em>Desmalopex</em> below are similar situations where following grammar rules strictly would go against prevailing usage. I am going to stick with the corrected forms for now but this is worth thinking about more.</p>
<p>We’ll likely see more such cases when we compare the two databases again, as I ran some checks that corrected a number of additional cases of gender misalignment.</p>
<p>Also just wanted to note that in <em>Vandeleuria</em> you <em>did</em> accept a gender correction based on historical data that clearly went against prevailing usage. <em>Kerivoula</em> is actually also masculine by the same argument as was used for <em>Vandeleuria</em>, which would be even more disruptive.</p>
<p>Lagothrix lagothricha vs. lagotricha (-) – I agree that ‘lagotricha’ is likely the correct spelling given that it’s the earlier name in the original publication and that it seems to be more grammatically correct (could be wrong about that though), but the paper that made the change was Fooden, 1963, which stated the following: “In Humboldt’s (1812) original publication, the name of this species is spelled lagotricha on page 322 and lagothricha on page 354. The spelling lagothricha is adopted here as the correct original spelling, in accordance with Article 32b and Article 24a(i) of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (Stoll et al., eds., 1961).” This was based on an earlier version of the code, but I wanted to know what you thought about this before I fully decided on the change. Fooden, J. (1963). A revision of the woolly monkeys (genus Lagothrix). Journal of Mammalogy, 44(2), 213-247.</p>
<p>Thanks, I hadn’t noticed that Humboldt also used the <em>lagothricha</em> spelling. In this case, it makes sense to accept Fooden’s paper as a First Reviser action and use the <em>lagothricha</em> spelling. I am making this change.</p>
<p>Hipposideros swinhoei vs. swinhoii (-) – Looked into this one a bit further and I think it’s in prevailing use at this point. Hill, 1963 suggested that swinhoei was the correct spelling, although he did not reference and earlier work that suggested the spelling emendation before him. I’m linking to the page in Hill, 1963 that suggests the use of swinhoei, which is probably an unjustified emendation that has become the more used spelling. I’m not to sure what to do about at this point though, because I haven’t found any significant publications using the ‘swinhoii’ spelling. If you have any more insight or other publications, I’d love to see them. Currently asking BatNames what they think too. https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/2340818 <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/2340818__;!!IKRxdwAv5BmarQ!b878SwkAx834drR6PVLLFS5LzP5kKkC07wYlJyXfR1OO4ZY_q-0FDNiYw8XI89wRKWbFrJc8-E7qKO4HNy0KbqTvNb0$" class="uri">https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/2340818__;!!IKRxdwAv5BmarQ!b878SwkAx834drR6PVLLFS5LzP5kKkC07wYlJyXfR1OO4ZY_q-0FDNiYw8XI89wRKWbFrJc8-E7qKO4HNy0KbqTvNb0$</a></p>
<p>There’s probably a good argument for prevailing usage here yes. Just to add some data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allen (1938:192) used <em>swinhoii</em>: Allen, G.M. 1938. The mammals of China and Mongolia. Part 1. Natural History of Central Asia 11(1):1-620.</li>
<li>Dobson (1878:135) was probably the first to use <em>swinhoei</em>: Dobson, G.E. 1878-06-15. Catalogue of the Chiroptera in the Collection of the British Museum. Taylor and Francis, British Museum Catalogue, 567 pp.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sorry for the misleading citation of Hill (1963) in my earlier message; I must have missed the place where says <em>swinhoei</em> is “more correct”.</p>
<p>Crocidura greenwoodae vs greenwoodi – will be changing this one back to greenwoodi after some conversations with someone at the IUCN (haven’t decided on what to do with the rest of the -orum additions we’ve talked about but whatever Batnames decides for Pteropus gilliardorum will guide my answer there).</p>
<p>Yes, I think it’s worth thinking about all of these and treating them in a similar way. In addition to the cases I brought up there are a few more similar ones among fossils, synonyms, etc. <em>Vespadelus douglasorum</em> was originally <em>douglasi</em>.</p>

<p>I just noticed that Mazama nana, which was original described as Cervus nanus as you pointed out, might be in prevailing use as an adjective. What do you think Jelle, should we go through with the change to ‘nanus’ to match the original description since it is a noun, or should we go with prevailing use here? I’m starting to get really frustrated by prevailing use… I don’t feel too strongly. If nothing else, it might make sense for you to stick with the current spelling so you can go ahead with the next MDD update. A couple of thoughts on this case: - Apparently HMW actually went with <em>Mazama nanus</em>: http://treatment.plazi.org/id/03A087C4FFE6FFE7FA73FD52EF18F7E6. I don’t see a lot of publications that followed it since 2011 though. - I’m not sure about treating it as an adjective in prevailing usage, since there’s no such thing as an adjective <em>nanus</em>. Perhaps it’s allowable though. - If we do argue for prevailing usage here, maybe we should also switch back to <em>Mesocapromys nanus</em> under prevailing usage. - This issue also affects <em>Cercartetus nanus</em>, which was originally <em>Phalangista nana</em>, and therefore should logically now be <em>Cercartetus nana</em>. - There are other nomenclatural problems with <em>Mazama nana</em>. I am not sure it is an available name (see my comments under http://hesperomys.com/n/27687, bottom of the page). In addition it is possibly preoccupied by <em>Cervus nanus</em> Kaup, 1834 (http://hesperomys.com/n/84737), though I haven’t yet tracked down the original description of that name. Hmm, I think I prefer switching it to match the original for all these species at this moment. I’ll need to note the Cercartetus one, I hadn’t noted it before. I’m not sure how prevailing use holds with some of these, so making these changes seems adequate for now. There are a few changes that I want more perspective on, and I’ll set up a draft email to the nomenclature committee to ask them about it.</p>

<p>Sounds good. Unrelatedly, did you already get <em>Metachirus aritanai</em> (https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/mammalia-2021-0176/html)? It was just published in January.

<p>I wanted to clarify some things.</p>
<p>I found out that in cases where names are changing for gender agreement, prevailing use does not apply to these cases. Thus, Caluromysiops irrupta should change to irruptus as you mentioned, as well as the Desmalopex example. Although, the Myoictes and Nyctimene examples I’m less confident on, as I’m not to sure wavica/us is an adjective and if Nyctimene is truly. I’ll be back after more research… But this relates to a number of the changes we’ve discussed. Also, <span class="citation" data-cites="JelleZijlstra">@JelleZijlstra</span>, you mentioned that Kerivoula might be masculine. Would you mind elaborating on that a little? If so, we would need to make a pretty big change and I’d have to make the Batnames people really frustrated…</p>
<p>It’s for the same reason as <em>Vandeleuria</em>. The original description is here: https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/2324282. It included a species named <em>Kerivoula griseus</em>, using the masculine adjectival form <em>griseus</em> (that species is apparently a synonym of <em>Pipistrellus pipistrellus</em>, but that doesn’t matter). Therefore, by ICZN Art. 30.2.3, <em>Kerivoula</em> is to be treated as masculine. I am thinking of writing a petition to the ICZN to officially mark <em>Kerivoula</em> (and maybe <em>Vandeleuria</em> too) as feminine; I don’t think anything good will come out of renaming all the species. Gray does also include a species <em>V. picta</em> (feminine), but it’s pretty clear that name is being used in combination with <em>Vespertilio</em> (the previous generic assignment), not with <em>Kerivoula</em>. <em>Kerivoula</em> is also not a classical term (it’s supposedly from a Sinhala word for bats). Yeah, I agree with the comment for Kerivoula. Vandeleuria it nowhere near as commonly used in the literature and the names are now getting used with that spelling following the HMW now, so I think I’m comfortable leaving that one in all honesty. But the Kerivoula one, I think that it would be pretty unstable to make that change. A similar case was made for Cryptotis a while back, which was gender fixed to masculine.</p>
<p>Another thing, I was given the following arguments against the use of Glauconycteris curryi, and I agree with them and will be using curryae.</p>
<p>Victor Van Cakenberghe - “Grubb (2004: 13) mentioned:” The authors did not explain how the specific name was formed but as there is no ‘y’ in Latin, the name’ curryi’ can be assumed to have been formed directly from the modern personal name and therefore, as it is the name of a woman, must be corrected to ‘curryae’ (Article 31.1.2, ICZN 1999)."</p>
<p>Against Jelle’s argumentation (in Connor’s comment) is the fact that the original description (as curryi) also dates from 2001 (and Eger and Schlitter (2001) is the only publication I was able to find that used curryi as a valid name). So, there was hardly any time for curryi to be accepted and the prevailing use has been for curryae. An additional argument might be that the change has been published by Judith Eger, who was one of the people describing it and as such might be interpreted as a correction of an error she was aware of."</p>
<p>Charles Francis - "The one exception to not changing an original spelling mentioned listed by Dubois (2007) is the situation where the name is unambiguously formed from a modern name that has not been Latinized. Victor provides a strong rationale that was the case: the fact that a Latinized name would not end in ‘y’ and perhaps more importantly that one of the original describers corrected the name. Furthermore, although only 22 years ago, prevailing use would seem relevant if everybody has accepted the emendation.</p>
<p>I thus favour curryae."</p>
<p>Conversely, there is some argumentation over gillardi/gillardorum by the Batnames community:</p>
<p>Andrea Cirranello - “gilliardi is correct; gilliardorum is an unjustified emendation. I think this should be changed to the correct original spelling. Charles makes an excellent point - I think we need to figure out what”prevailing usage" means when we have incorrect spellings or agreement and possibly publish one of our Zenodo opinions for that definition. I believe it would be much appreciated by the taxonomic community. In the context of reversal of precendece: In accordance with the purpose of the Principle of Priority [Art. 23.2], its application is moderated as follows:</p>
<p>23.9.1. prevailing usage must be maintained when the following conditions are both met:</p>
<p>23.9.1.1. the senior synonym or homonym has not been used as a valid name after 1899, and</p>
<p>23.9.1.2. the junior synonym or homonym has been used for a particular taxon, as its presumed valid name, in at least 25 works, published by at least 10 authors in the immediately preceding 50 years and encompassing a span of not less than 10 years. I am pretty sure this is not meant to apply to our situation here where we have a change in ending that is still attributed to the original author, but it is interesting to think about. FishBase defines “prevailing usage” as<br />
In taxonomy, that usage of the name which is adopted by at least a substantial majority of the most recent authors concerned with the relevant taxon, irrespective of how long ago their work was published. From 33.5 of the Code “In any case of doubt whether a different subsequent spelling is an emendation or an incorrect subsequent spelling, it is to be treated as an incorrect subsequent spelling (and therefore unavailable), and not as an emendation.” I should also say that I agree with the comments that Dubois (2009) has made regarding prevailing usage where he feels this should be restricted to things like Mus musculus and Homo sapiens, which are widely known by non-specialist users, rather than names that only taxonomists use - such as this one. "</p>
<p>Charles Francis - "See my note above under H. swinhoei / swinhoii.</p>
<p>As noted above, Dubois (2007) suggests that the code gives flexiblity to form genitives in a wide variety of ways, and therefore, it is not possible to argue that a name was incorrectly formed except in a very limited number of cases. On this basis, virtually any change to a name to derive a different genitive would be an unjustified emendation.</p>
<p>Unlike Viktor, I would not call Dubois (2007) a ‘proposal / suggestion’, but rather an interpretation of the wording of the code. I do agree that the changes in wording to the code proposed by Dubois to enhance clarity have not been adopted, but I do not know whether anybody has formally approached ICZN to request the change. In any case, reading the code, I would have to agree with Dubois (2007) that there is, in fact, no provision in the code to change supposedly incorrect genitives – in fact, article 32.5.1 explicitly states that incorrect latinization is not to be considered an inadvertent error.</p>
<p>under: 31.1.1. A species-group name, if a noun in the genitive case formed from a personal name that is Latin, or from a modern personal name that is or has been latinized, is to be formed in accordance with the rules of Latin grammar.</p>
<p>As noted by Dubois (2007) the rules of Latin grammar are complex and many different endings are possible, and the endings proposed under 31.2.1 are not relevant to 31.1.1.</p>
<p>Furthermore, under 32.5.1. "If there is in the original publication itself, without recourse to any external source of information, clear evidence of an inadvertent error, such as a lapsus calami or a copyist’s or printer’s error, it must be corrected. Incorrect transliteration or latinization, or use of an inappropriate connecting vowel, are not to be considered inadvertent errors.</p>
<p>On this basis, it seems clear that the change to Pteropus gilliardorum was an unjustified emendation.</p>
<p>The only exception relates to: 33.2.3.1. when an unjustified emendation is in prevailing usage and is attributed to the original author and date it is deemed to be a justified emendation.</p>
<p>We thus need to determine what ‘prevailing usage’ means. I personally think this should be determined based not just on the number of papers, but the unanimity of the perspective, and the length of time over which the emendation has been adopted. In this case, I believe the change was proposed by Flannery (1995), so 25 years ago, but during that period several authors have not accepted the change, so it is certainly not unanimous.</p>
<p>However, to avoid the risk of flip-flopping, I would suggest we hold off on the change until our group has an accepted definition of ‘prevailing usage’. I would, however, suggest including a note to suggest this could be considered an unjustified emendation. "</p>
<p>Victor Van Cakenberghe - "In the literature I found Pteropus gilliardorum mentioned by: Almeida et al. (2014, 2020), Aplin and Opiang (2012), Aziz et al. (2021), Benda (2010b), Beolens et al. (2009), Carvajal and Adler (2005), Conenna et al. (2017a), Flannery (1995b), Fleming and Racey (2009), Han et al. (2016), Marsh et al. (2022), Martyn et al. (2012), Mendes (2011), Meng et al. (2016), Neaves et al. (2018), Nesi et al. (2021), Phalen et al. (2017), Regan et al. (2015), Riccucci and Lanza (2014a), Richards and Gamui (2011), Rolland et al. (2014), Simmons (2005b), Simmons and Ciranello (2023), Strahan and Conder (2007), Tayor and Tuttle (2019), Tsang (2015), Tsang et al. (2019 [for 2020]), Wieringa (2022), Wiles and Brooke (2009).</p>
<p>Pteropus gillardi: Honacki et al. (1982), Koopman (1993a), Lapointe et al. (1999b), Mendes (2011), Mickleburgh et al. (1992), Scanlon et al. (2014b), Van Deusen (1969), Vendetti et al. (2011).</p>
<p>This would indicate that ‘gilliardorum’ is indeed in prevailing use, but that should not be an argument.</p>
<p>Dubois’ arguments might make sense, but this is only a proposal/suggestion not an article nor a recommendation. Furthermore, I would assume that the ICZN might accept this suggestion, but in view of the stability of the names rule that this might only be valid for names given (or corrected) after a specific year (as is done in various other articles).</p>
<p>I’m in favour of Pteropus gilliardorum.</p>
<p>See also Guedes et al. (2023), which I have not seen (but do not agree with, but that is another discussion).</p>
<p>Guedes, P., Alves-Martins, F., Arribas, J.M., Chatterjee, S., Santos, A.M.C., Lewin, A., Bako, L., Webala, P.W., Correia, R.A., Rocha, R. Ladle, R.J. (2023). Eponyms have no place in 21st-century biological nomenclature - Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution. Doi: 10.1038/s41559-023-02022-y"</p>
<p>This has opened my eyes a little bit to my opinion on the change of these kind of names, and I’ll have to evaluate them case by case. Crocidura greenwoodi in my opinion should be retained rather than greenwoodae, as the HMW did. However, I may have different opinions on some of the other names, but will need to evaluate them individually. I’m also really trying to settle on a definition of prevailing use, because it’s getting rough trying to argue about it.</p>
<p>Also, here is a note on Notopteris neocalidonicus (you use neocalidonica) from Charles Francis: "According to the code, note the line in blue: 30.1.4.5. A genus-group name that is or ends in a Latin word of which the ending has been changed takes the gender appropriate to the new ending; <strong>if the ending is such as not to indicate a particular gender, the name is to be treated as masculine</strong>.</p>
<p>On this basis, Notopteris should be treated as masculine, and neocaledonicus is correct."</p>
<p>I’m going to retain Notopteris neocalidonicus for now. Thanks for sharing the feedback from BatNames. I would actually caution against treating these on a case-by-case basis too much: that can lead to special pleading and to arguments that aren’t grounded in the Code. For example, the argument that <em>curryae</em> may be emended because it was unambiguously based on a non-Latin personal name would seem to apply equally to “Gilliard”. It is not true that Latin names can never consider “y”, as this letter can appear in Greek loanwords (one of the consuls for the year 163 was named “Bithynicus”).</p>
<p>The stronger argument for <em>curryae</em> is how quickly the name was corrected (in the next issue of the same volume). Under Art. 32.5.1.1 of the Code, that does provide a strong argument that the emendation is justified in this case.</p>
<p>So instead of name-specific arguments, I would want to look at all names that fit this pattern and try to come up with a consistent set of criteria based on the text of the Code. Here’s a list of all names in my database where a patronym appears to have been emended: https://gist.github.com/JelleZijlstra/89085754cff7558e612a2acd0afc4da7. In addition to the ones we already discussed, there are several among fossil mammals (and a few more among nonmammals included in my DB). There is one more among living mammals that I currently accept at the emended form: <em>Vespadelus douglasorum</em>, which was originally <em>douglasi</em>.</p>
<p>Honestly I’d prefer to work on improving taxonomic coverage and resolving missing names instead though; these spelling issues can wait.</p>
<p>As for <em>Notopteris</em>, I agree that treating it as masculine is the technically correct approach. I kept it as feminine out of concern for preserving usage, but if the bat specialists are on board with changing, I’ll make the change too. I’ll add that the technical argument for making this change is very similar to that for <em>Myoictis wavicus</em>: the original spelling of <em>Notopteris neocaledonica</em> used the feminine form in combination with a masculine genus, and the specific epithet in both cases uses the <em>-icus</em> suffix.</p>
<p>I see what you mean, getting to nitty-gritty with it is what’s making it really difficult to make these decisions, especially trying to match between the Batnames database and the MDD. The main reason I’m having issues going through these is because we are trying to make the MDD and Batnames databases match exactly, which means arguing about prevailing use and whether epithets are nouns or adjectives unfortunately.</p>
<p>I quickly looked through your list of patronym emendations and although I don’t want to get to into the weeds with this, but there are a few that I would consider retaining the emendation as justified based primarily on prevailing use. Here’s a list of species with a decision for what I’m going to do on the MDDs next update:</p>
<p>Crocidura anselli/ansellorum - emendation was in 1987 just after original description (both in volume 38) and looks to be in prevailing use regardless; I’ll be retaining <strong>ansellorum</strong> based on prevailing use and Article 35.5.1.1.</p>
<p>Crocidura greenwoodi/greenwoodae - emendation by me (not really, Normand David did it in the galley proofs without me knowing) in 2018. I consider this an unjustified emendation and will be using <strong>greenwoodi</strong> on the MDD.</p>
<p>Pteropus gilliardi/gilliardorum - unjustified emendation not in prevailing use, using <strong>gilliardi</strong>.</p>
<p>Glauconycteris curryi/curryae - the emendation was in 2001 immediately after the original description and appears to be in prevailing use. I will be using <strong>curryae</strong> on the argument of prevailing use and in accordance with Article 35.5.1.1 (in the same volume).</p>
<p>Vespadelus douglasi/douglasorum - the emendation was in 1987 and original description in 1976. I would think this would be an unjustified emendation, but I feel that it is in prevailing use at this point. However, I’m curious if you have another reason for having it as the only one you accept? Will be retaining <strong>douglasorum</strong> since I can’t find many publications that use douglasi.</p>
<p>Piliocolobus waldroni/waldronae - this is certainly an unjustified emendation and doesn’t appear to be in prevailing use (plenty of pubs using either spelling), and I will make the change to <strong>waldroni</strong> on the MDD.</p>
<p>Aotus nancymai/nancymaae - this one is an unjustified emendation that doesn’t appear to be in prevailing use; MDD already uses <strong>nancymai</strong> (this was a decision at the time made by Russel Mittermeier, I’m not sure what his logic was while retaining the other Primate patronym emendations).</p>
<p>Chiropotes utahicki/utahickae - same comment as Aotus nancymai. Retaining <strong>utahicki</strong>.</p>
<p>Lepilemur ahmansoni/ahmansonorum - unjustified emendation, although most publications use the emended spelling now; however, with how recent it is and that there are still recent papers refuting this change (e.g., Krell, F. T., &amp; Marshall, S. A. (2017). New species described from photographs: yes? no? sometimes? A fierce debate and a new declaration of the ICZN. Insect Systematics and Diversity, 1(1), 3-19.). I will be changing to <strong>ahmansoni</strong> on the MDD.</p>
<p>Lepilemur grewcocki/grewcockorum- unjustified emendation, although most publications use the emended spelling now; however, with how recent it is and that there are still recent papers refuting this change (e.g., Krell, F. T., &amp; Marshall, S. A. (2017). New species described from photographs: yes? no? sometimes? A fierce debate and a new declaration of the ICZN. Insect Systematics and Diversity, 1(1), 3-19.). I will be changing to <strong>grewcocki</strong> on the MDD.</p>
<p>Lepilemur hubbardi/hubbardorum- unjustified emendation, although most publications use the emended spelling now; however, with how recent it is and that there are still recent papers refuting this change (e.g., Krell, F. T., &amp; Marshall, S. A. (2017). New species described from photographs: yes? no? sometimes? A fierce debate and a new declaration of the ICZN. Insect Systematics and Diversity, 1(1), 3-19.). I will be changing to <strong>hubbardi</strong> on the MDD.</p>
<p>Lepilemur jamesi/jamesorum- unjustified emendation, although most publications use the emended spelling now; however, with how recent it is and that there are still recent papers refuting this change (e.g., Krell, F. T., &amp; Marshall, S. A. (2017). New species described from photographs: yes? no? sometimes? A fierce debate and a new declaration of the ICZN. Insect Systematics and Diversity, 1(1), 3-19.). I will be changing to <strong>jamesi</strong> on the MDD.</p>
<p>Lepilemur tymerlachsoni/tymerlachsonorum- unjustified emendation, although most publications use the emended spelling now; however, with how recent it is and that there are still recent papers refuting this change (e.g., Krell, F. T., &amp; Marshall, S. A. (2017). New species described from photographs: yes? no? sometimes? A fierce debate and a new declaration of the ICZN. Insect Systematics and Diversity, 1(1), 3-19.). I will be changing to <strong>tymerlachsoni</strong> on the MDD.</p>
<p>Ochotona gromovi/gromovorum - this one’s unjustified and not used at this point, plus, I already use <strong>gromovi</strong>.</p>
<p>In summary, I’ll be changing them all to the original spelling except Crocidura ansellorum, Glauconycteris curryae, and Vespadelus douglasorum because of either Article 35.5.1.1 or through prevailing use.</p>
<p>Given that I am keeping Notopteris masculine, I will make the change to Myoictis wavicus to remain consistent. I’m also making the change for Nyctimene and Desmalopex as well for now, although I’m still waiting for opinions on it by Batnames (although after looking into them a good bit, I agree with you). Thanks, I think that’s a good approach. I will change to <em>curryae</em> and <em>ansellorum</em> since they were emended in the same volume. With that I believe our databases will be in agreement for all cases in this category, which is nice.</p>
<p>As for <em>Vespadelus douglasorum</em>, I suppose I didn’t change to <em>douglasi</em> because I used to believe these patronym emendations were always justified (since people kept making them), and I never went through and consistently applied my current understanding that these emendations are almost always unjustified. Possibly some more should be moved to the original spelling among the fossil ones, but right now I don’t feel the need to make those changes. In the <em>douglasi</em> case, I think you’re right that nobody is using the original spelling; I couldn’t find any usage of the species name <em>douglasi</em> with the new genus name <em>Vespadelus</em>. Quick note on this, but we could remake McKenna and Bells mammals above the species level if you want? I’ve been trying to find someone who’d want to do that and I feel like we’re a good crew to set that up. It’d give us an excuse to standardize how we treat mammal higher level taxa too. That would be quite the project, but I’d be up for it! We should talk about how to approach it. My database has most of the data for McKenna &amp; Bell’s format (except for distributions), but there would still be a ton of work getting the taxonomy all up to date and consistent. I think it’d be a bit easier than some of the other books I’ve worked on, but I think it’d be an cool one for sure! Using Hesperomys, we can make a draft pretty quick. I think there are some minor things we could do to expand on the McKenna and Bell format as well. The hardest part would be updating the taxonomy for fossil species and finding a publisher (I know someone at John Hopkins I can ask, and Lynx Edicions is another option I have a good working relationship with). Think it’d be a cool side project for the two of us! It also would provide a new starting point for people arguing about mammal higher-level taxonomy, which I think would be a valuable contribution to the field. A good one to expand would be giving citations; it’s very frustrating that McKenna &amp; Bell don’t. Definitely agree that higher-level taxonomy is due for an update, putting the fossil taxa into the molecular framework for living taxa. I agree, McKenna and Bell is pretty frustrating to use because of that. I wouldn’t want to go to crazy with it, but adding more context for the various arrangements would be really nice too.</p>

<p>I’ll just jump in and say that revising McKenna and Bell would be an awesome resource for very many people — at its most detailed, it could take information from the Paleobiology Database (mostly at the specimen level) and then collapse that up into taxa with FAD / LAD and taxonomic / bibliographic / geographic information included. This is potentially a ton of work, but Hesperomys has laid the groundwork for this in a tangible way. I hare your all’s frustration at McKenna and Bell’s format when I was in grad school…</p>
<p>Downstream, having a full fossil + extant listing of mammals that was revised to higher taxon ranks would allow for an otherwise naive analysis of divergence timing using a Bayesian fossilized birth-death model and taxonomic / age constraints. A helpful target to keep in mind at least!</p>

<p>Just a quick note on what I’m accepting onto the next MDD version for now. The nomenclature ones I am leaving as they are on the MDD for now, given that many of these should probably be published before making a change that will effect researchers widely. For the first set you recommended though, I have included all of the changes you suggested. (New post because the previous one is getting very long)</p>

<li>There are two different Le Contes and MDD should probably add initials: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Eatton_Le_Conte (who named <em>Myosciurus pumilio</em> and <em>Antrozous pallidus</em>), https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lawrence_LeConte (who named the two species above). They weren’t terribly consistent in writing their name as one or two words; I follow Wikipedia in using one word for J.L. and two words for J.E.</li>
