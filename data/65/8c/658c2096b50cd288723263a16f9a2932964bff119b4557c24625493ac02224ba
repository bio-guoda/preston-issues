To search throughout all versions of records, you have to include the all_versions=true querystring parameter like so:\r\n\r\n> https://zenodo.org/api/records/?q=_files.checksum:%22md5:61b36a86930f6ffb073f4e189bbd5723%22&all_versions=1\r\n\r\n> The above returns the record containing the file with that hash.\r\n\r\nAfter applying these suggestions, I was able to find the \"older\" README file with hash://md5/d11ddcecf3d5cbc627439260bdbfda72 referenced earlier in this issue:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npreston cat --remote https://zenodo.org hash://md5/d11ddcecf3d5cbc627439260bdbfda72\\\r\n | head\r\n```\r\n\r\nproduced the expected \r\n\r\n> Global Biotic Interactions: Interpreted Data Products\r\n>\r\n> Global Biotic Interactions (GloBI, https://globalbioticinteractions.org, [1]) aims to facilitate access to existing species interaction records (e.g., predator-prey, plant-pollinator, virus-host). This data publication provides interpreted species interaction data products. These products are the result of a process in which versioned, existing species interaction datasets ([2]) are linked to the so-called GloBI Taxon Graph ([3]) and transformed into various aggregate formats (e.g., tsv, csv, neo4j, rdf/nquad, darwin core-ish archives). In addition, the applied name maps are included to make the applied taxonomic linking explicit. \r\n>\r\n> Citation\r\n> --------\r\n>\r\n> GloBI is made possible by researchers, collections, projects and institutions openly sharing their datasets. When using this data, please make sure to attribute these *original data contributors*, including citing the specific datasets in derivative work. Each species interaction record indexed by GloBI contains a reference and dataset citation. Also, a full lists of all references can be found in citations.csv/citations.tsv files in this publication. If you have ideas on how to make it easier to cite original datasets, please open/join a discussion via https://globalbioticinteractions.org or related projects.\r\n>\r\n> To credit GloBI for more easily finding interaction data, please use the following citation to reference GloBI:\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/comments/1517784203/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/comments/1517784564","html_url":"https://github.com/bio-guoda/preston/issues/210#issuecomment-1517784564","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/210","id":1517784564,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCMmefs5ad430","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-21T12:46:46Z","updated_at":"2023-04-21T12:46:46Z","body":"Thank you @slint !","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/comments/1517784564/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
