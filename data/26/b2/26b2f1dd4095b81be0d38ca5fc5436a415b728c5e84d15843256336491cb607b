However, why was emitStartedAt introduced?\r\n\r\nYikes! Those little constants weren't really supposed to be permanent. Just an awkward way to bring up discussion about which statements should be included when emitting an activity. I've removed the code related to those constants and added to the discussion in #33.\r\n\r\nThanks for the feedback!","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/comments/603531808/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
