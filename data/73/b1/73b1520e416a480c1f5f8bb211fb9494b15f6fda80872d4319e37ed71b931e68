These DOIs (also called download or query DOIs) are intended to be used in citations to track usage of GBIF generated biodiversity datasets derived from registered biodiversity datasets.\r\n\r\nIn #62 , @faroit proposed a use case to use GBIF DOIs to track associated \"download datasets\" and associated media. \r\n\r\nThis issue describes a feature to allow Preston to track GBIF download/query DOI and their associated metadata and (occurrence data) via:\r\n\r\n```preston track https://doi.org/10.15468/dl.4n9w6m``` \r\n\r\nor using a synonym command\r\n\r\n ```preston update https://doi.org/10.15468/dl.4n9w6m```\r\n\r\nPlease note however, that this feature does *not* cover resolving image data. Another issue will be opened for that.
