Doing this quickly requires building an index. I can imagine two ways this could work:\r\n\r\n1) Feed nquads into `preston index` for indexing\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ echo <nquads> | preston index\r\n# to index everything:\r\n$ preston ls | preston index\r\n# to just index aliases:\r\n$ preston alias | preston index\r\n# to index whatever you want:\r\n$ preston ls | grep <whatever> | preston index\r\n```\r\n\r\n2) Feed hashes (or nquads containing hashes) into `preston index` and index their content\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ echo hash://sha256/abc | preston index\r\n# or\r\n$ echo <blah> <...hasVersion> <hash://sha256/abc> | preston index\r\n# to index everything:\r\n$ preston history | preston index\r\n# to index the latest log:\r\n$ preston head | preston index\r\n```\r\nOption 1 is simpler and makes it easier for the user to pick and choose what goes into the index\r\n\r\nOption 2 has the advantage of being able to record where statements came from, which is a big part of what \"indexes\" do, and also keeps the provenance chain going, which is great. e.g. in a Lucene index where \"documents\" represent RDF statements, we could record each statement's origin as a line in a provenance log (`line:hash://sha256/abc!/L52`)\r\n\r\n(There's also an option 3: do both option 1 and option 2)\r\n\r\nOption 1 is tempting but I think I favor option 2. @jhpoelen thoughts?
