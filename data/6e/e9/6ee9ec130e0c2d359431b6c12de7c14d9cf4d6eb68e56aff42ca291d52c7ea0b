Currently, all capturing groups are reported. They need to be specified non-capturing to be ignored, e.g. `(?:blahblah)` instead of `(blahblah)`. Obviously, marking groups capturing/non-capturing has uses that are completely separate from whether or not we would want to record the submatch, so this is not an ideal solution.\r\n\r\nI could restrict it to only report named groups. This is also not a perfect solution -- group names (while not totally necessary) might only be there to make backreferencing easier -- but \"report named groups\" is probably be a better rule than \"report capturing groups\". A less confusing approach might be to specify groups to report by name as an option to `preston match`, e.g. `preston match -g group1,group2,group3`, and/or have an option to report all (named?) submatches.\r\n\r\nIn any case, whatever we decide on should definitely make its way to the `match` help section.\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\nEdit - as for why I chose to only report capturing groups, Java's pattern/matcher classes do not provide a simple way of accessing group names, so we'd need to do some funny business to try to get those names (e.g. run a group name detecting regex on the regex). I realized that, without making any changes to code, specifying groups to be non-capturing would prevent preston from reporting them, so that's what we have now.\r\n\r\nEdit 2 - oops, I should have used `(?:` for non-capturing groups instead of `(?>`, which is also non-capturing but with some additional restrictions.","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/comments/713237007/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/comments/713746483","html_url":"https://github.com/bio-guoda/preston/issues/87#issuecomment-713746483","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/87","id":713746483,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxMzc0NjQ4Mw==","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-21T17:48:41Z","updated_at":"2020-10-21T17:48:41Z","body":"Thanks for elaborating.
