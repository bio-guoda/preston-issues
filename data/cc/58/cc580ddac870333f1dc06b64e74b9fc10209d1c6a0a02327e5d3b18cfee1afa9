But I'm still struggling to follow the example.  Partly I'm struggling over the pseudo-code, and figuring out when you're hashing a url and when you're hashing content at the url.  \r\n\r\ne.g. what would the following block look like on a bash command line using `sha256sum`?\r\n\r\n```\r\nsha256(\r\n  sha256(<https://search.idigbio.org/v2/search/publishers>)\r\n  + sha256(<http://purl.org/pav/hasVersion>)\r\n) \r\n```\r\n\r\n(I think you are hashing urls as strings, but I tried:\r\n\r\n```\r\necho -n \"https://search.idigbio.org/v2/search/publishers\" | sha256sum\r\n3edfe376ce9a6602fec3a6d3fa30d1d97bbf7a768fb855c8c75eeab389e1e3ef  -\r\n```\r\nwhich is not the hash shown in the example.  The next one seems to match though:\r\n\r\n```\r\n echo -n \"http://purl.org/pav/hasVersion\" | sha256sum\r\n0b658d6c9e2f6275fee7c564a229798c56031c020ded04c1040e30d2527f1806  -\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not entirely sure how to \"add\" them either (i.e. is that two hashes, written in hash-uri format and separated by a newline?)\r\n\r\napologies for being dense here.","closed_by":{"login":"cboettig","id":222586,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjU4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/222586?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cboettig","html_url":"https://github.com/cboettig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cboettig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cboettig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cboettig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cboettig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cboettig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cboettig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cboettig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cboettig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cboettig/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/52/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/52/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
