Or do I misunderstand this?\r\n\r\n@qgroom great question! The random sample was a bit of a . . . random sample. If you'd like to cherry pick dates, you can do that too. What did you have in mind? \r\n\r\nThe snapshot sampling frequency has been monthly since about 2019-03 . Prior to that, weekly snapshots were taken starting 2018-09, but the logs have a slightly different format, making it a little more difficult to process with methods implemented.\r\n\r\nBtw - make.sh was able to process about 4-5 snapshots overnight without too much optimization. However, I forgot to install \"miller\" https://miller.readthedocs.io/ on the server, so the last part of processing (join/align) is still missing.  Have installed it now, and hoping to get some results later in the day. \r\n\r\nWe now have a neat list of tracked content with \"traits\" like \"has still image\" or \"has preserved specimen\". In other words, we've build a time series of digitized collections of preserved specimen with images as seen by iDigBio / GBIF / BioCaSE. That is something right? If you'd like I can share some preliminary results on that. \r\n\r\nAlso, yes, I agree that make.sh looks a little involved.

Nor do the differences between taxa change in an interesting way with time.\r\n\r\nI'm not really clear from the thread if we can trust the results. @timrobertson100 says the numbers are lower than he expects, but I don't understand why taxonomic matching would effect the total scores.\r\n\r\nSo far the key statistic for me is that the number of images has doubled in three years.

As long as we are clear how the numbers were calculated (as documented in ```make.sh```) reviewers can always ask to make the taxonomic name matching more advanced. And, as stated earlier, we are aware that our numbers of an under estimation due to variability in how taxonomic names are reported by providers. \r\n\r\nAnd, I think a simple table would suffice to support the claim that the volume of images associated with identified preserved specimen has grown significantly over the last couple of years.\r\n\r\nAll and all, I am happy with the \"boring\" results, especially given the sheer volume and speed at which we produced them from the original source data.

To me, getting a different perspective on a dataset can be quite stimulating. I'd be happy to hear more about your comparison between the Preston-based output and your corpus. I'd be especially interested in: \r\n\r\n1. the provenance of the datasets (where did they come from and what version was used)\r\n2. interpretation of taxonomic names\r\n3. origin of taxonomic names\r\n\r\nSo far, I am unclear on exactly how I'd reproduce the GBIF workflow independently, so a comparative study like the one you are suggestion sounds like a good first step to do that. \r\n\r\nAnd, as far as @qgroom 's request goes - at this time, I have no evidence to suggest that the processing workflow is incorrect somehow. I do know the limitations of the analysis as documented in the make.sh script (e.g., only scientificName is used and no other taxonomic fields) and feel confident that I can reproduce the results when needed by re-processing the content associated with the versioned corpus as defined in the discussed provenance logs. \r\n\r\nIn other words, I am looking forward to your analysis, and I don't see any reason to doubt the outcomes of the limited analysis done within the scope of this specific question: how did the preserved specimen image count change over time in the past years? \r\n\r\nPlease do share if you feel there's errors in the analysis!\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/comments/1221127496/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/comments/1221176400","html_url":"https://github.com/bio-guoda/preston/issues/168#issuecomment-1221176400","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/168","id":1221176400,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCMmefs5IyaxQ","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-19T23:50:16Z","updated_at":"2022-08-19T23:51:30Z","body":"@qgroom just kicked off another analysis after tweaking make.sh to include more likely dwca candidates.
