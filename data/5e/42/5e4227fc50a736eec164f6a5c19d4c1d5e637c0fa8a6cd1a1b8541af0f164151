Root cause was the configuration of the linker.bio server, and has been fixed via https://github.com/bio-guoda/preston-service/commit/1ab55c1d1ecef96a56214610fe76e6ef8962a27b . I'll deploy the new configuration momentarily. Please do not that nginx (webserver) has a cache, so the old results may persist for a while. Probably something to think about when swimming upstream using the funky query hashes that we've introduced to make it easy to look into the future. \r\n\r\nCurious to hear your thoughts . . .

At least for the funky query hashes, I can use my local index instead when needed.\r\n\r\nI feel like `preston head -r [anchor]` should swim up the index starting at `[anchor]`, but that's not what I'm seeing (https://github.com/bio-guoda/preston/issues/245#issuecomment-1579024404).
