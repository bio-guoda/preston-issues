CI PAOS builds on previous investments including those through Dear Colleague Letters [NSF19-069](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2019/nsf19069/nsf19069.jsp),[NSF20-068](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2020/nsf20068/nsf20068.jsp), [NSF 23-018](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2023/nsf23018/nsf23018.jsp), and the FAIROS Research Coordination Networks (RCN) program solicitation ([NSF 22-553](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/findable-accessible-interoperable-reusable-open/nsf22-553/solicitation)).  \r\n>\r\n> NSF accepts proposals pursuant to this Program Description year-round. From time to time, NSF may also issue Dear Colleague Letters to encourage proposals on special thematic interests and opportunities related to this program.\r\n\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\n1.
