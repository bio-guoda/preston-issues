The\r\nNSF PAI aims to make the results of NSF-supported research publicly available to the\r\ngreatest extent possible. The CI PAOS program aims to catalyze new and transformative\r\nsocio-technical partnerships supporting research data infrastructure ecosystems across\r\ndomains through early-stage collaborative activities between cyberinfrastructure researchers,\r\nscientists, research computing experts, data management experts, research labs, university\r\nlibraries, and other communities of practice.\r\nAdvancements in data management across all research disciplines are needed to achieve\r\nnational public access goals, including to \"make publications and their supporting data\r\nresulting from federally funded research publicly accessible without embargo on their free and\r\npublic release\"1 and implementing guidance to digital repositories that hold data from\r\nfederally funded projects. This DCL responds to these needs while building upon previous\r\nNSF Dear Colleague Letters: Reproducibility and Replicability in Science (NSF 23-018),\r\nOpen Science for Research Data (NSF 20-068), and Effective Practices for Data (NSF 19-\r\n069).\r\nAccordingly, proposals are invited from across communities for Early-concept Grants for\r\nExploratory Research (EAGER) projects and for workshops to address competency building,\r\n1\r\ncapability building, and community building supporting RDM and public access. There is also\r\na growing demand for international FAIR research collaboration, coordination, and RDM\r\ncapacity. NSF particularly welcomes proposals involving new and innovative partnerships\r\n(such as between cyberinfrastructure (CI) researchers and providers, computer scientist (CS)\r\nand information technology (IT) researchers, domain scientists, and/or university libraries)\r\nthat address RDM topics such as, but not limited to, the following examples:\r\n1. Addressing data formats, metadata standards, and harmonization across domains while\r\nleveraging existing cyberinfrastructure to advance research data lifecycle management;\r\n2. Addressing data curation, provenance, record keeping, organization of data, storage of\r\ndata, linking, reporting of research data and results, sharing and access, institutional\r\npolicies, and data management standard operating procedures for projects;\r\n3. Promoting machine-readability, reproducibility, and utility for AI computing, resource,\r\nand tools to deploy modular RDM training for PIs, trainees, students at any scale;\r\n4. Improving domain-specific data quality guidance, formats, RDM best practices, scientific\r\nconnections, restrictive/sensitive RDM, transfer of large datasets, and case studies;\r\n5. Leveraging existing data repositories or hardware/software computational resources for\r\nimproving research data management, linking datasets within repositories, and\r\ncombining data to gain new insights for sharing information with research communities;\r\n6. Enabling community-scale integration of, and access to, data sets from funded research\r\nand/or those generated by industry to enable new research and discovery broadly for\r\nthe CISE and other research communities;\r\n7. Investigating interdisciplinary and international collaborations, costs, and continuity of\r\nRDM infrastructure for publications and data across projects, centers, and facilities for\r\nNSF-funded research;\r\n8. Coordinating, facilitating, and/or evaluating U.S. and international FAIROS integrated\r\nresearch infrastructure efforts.\r\nProposals must follow the guidance contained in the NSF Proposal and Award Policies and\r\nProcedures Guide (PAPPG) for EAGER (see PAPPG Chapter II.F.3) and\r\nConference/Workshop (see PAPPG Chapter II.F.8) proposals. Proposals should clearly\r\ndescribe the intellectual merit, broader impact, and budget for the proposed effort.\r\nEarly-Concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) proposals are encouraged\r\nfor high-risk/high-reward innovative concepts and pilot and other research proposals\r\nthat contribute to community readiness and advancements in RDM for public access\r\nand open science. EAGERs can be supported up to $300,000 for up to a two-year\r\nduration.\r\nConference/Workshop proposals are encouraged for community workshops and other\r\nevents that bring together communities of practice to explore and advance scientific\r\ncommunity readiness in response to this DCL (i.e., such as HPC experts, information\r\n2\r\ntechnology and computer scientists, library and information science, research labs,\r\nresearch libraries). Each Conference/Workshop proposal must not exceed $100,000 in\r\ntotal budget for a one-or two-year duration.\r\nHOW TO RESPOND TO THIS DEAR COLLEAGUE LETTER\r\n1. Proposers are required to email a Concept Outline, following the guidance in PAPPG\r\nChapter I.D.1, to the cognizant Program Director listed in this DCL. The email subject\r\nheader should start with \"NSF DCL: Leveraging Cyberinfrastructure for Research Data\r\nManagement (RDM)\".\r\n2. The PD may invite submission of an EAGER or Conference proposal based on an\r\nassessment of the alignment of the project description with the goals of the DCL and CI\r\nPAOS program [https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/cyberinfrastructure-publicaccess-open-science-ci].\r\nWhen submitting your proposal to the CI PAOS Program Description, the project title should\r\nbe of the form \"CI PAOS: Title\", after the PAPPG required prefix \"EAGER\" or \"Conference\".\r\nPlease also include \"Public Access\" as a keyword in the at the beginning of the overview\r\nsection of the project summary, and ensure inclusion of the following information in the\r\nproject description:\r\nA dedicated section describing the Appropriateness of Proposed Work for EAGER or\r\nConference funding,\r\nA dedicated section describing the relevance of the proposed work to CI PAOS goals\r\n(not to exceed one page).\r\nAfter submitting the proposal, the NSF-assigned proposal number should be emailed to the\r\nprogram director identified below with the subject header starting with \"NSF DCL: Leveraging\r\nCyberinfrastructure for Research Data Management (RDM) - Proposal Number\".\r\nTo be considered for priority consideration for FY 2024 funding, invited proposals must be\r\nsubmitted by 5:00 P.M. submitting organization's local time on July 3, 2024. There is not a\r\ndeadline for concept outlines.\r\nConcept outlines, as well as questions and inquiries about project ideas, should be sent to\r\nPlato Smith, Program Director, CISE/OAC, telephone: (703) 292-4278, email:\r\nplsmith@nsf.gov with a copy to FAIROSQueries@nsf.gov.\r\nSincerely,\r\nDilma Da Silva\r\nActing Assistant Director, Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering\r\n(CISE)\r\n3\r\nAlexandra R.
