For publishing to Zenodo, if the 50GB dataset limit becomes an issue, it's possible to request a quota increase at https://zenodo.org/support. They especially like it if a (future) paper needs to cite the data. I'm not sure about limits for the Internet Archive.\r\n\r\nHopefully we can publish in a similar manner to the DataONE and BHL observatories.
