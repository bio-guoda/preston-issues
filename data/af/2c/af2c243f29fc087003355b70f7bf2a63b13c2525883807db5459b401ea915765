copy):\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ preston ls | tail -n1\r\n<urn:example:bee.jpg> <http://purl.org/pav/hasVersion> <hash://sha256/fb094ebe0ff220664af30b89e30ee04f0220c89675a52785c5552d9dee7eeea8> <urn:uuid:281f6621-dbe9-463c-8823-920949246a0d> .\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that currently, only the first found alias is resolved using ```preston cat bee.jpg``` and the configured provenance log locations (can be local/remote). And, when querying for the same alias  ```preston alias bee.jpg``` many more available aliases can be found if available.\r\n\r\n@cboettig @mielliott is this what you had in mind? \r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/comments/930644475/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/comments/930654094","html_url":"https://github.com/bio-guoda/preston/issues/135#issuecomment-930654094","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/135","id":930654094,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCMmefs43eKeO","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-30T00:47:32Z","updated_at":"2021-09-30T00:47:32Z","body":"The big step here is to treat any kind of non-content hash (e.g., url, doi, uuid) as a content *query* alias , not as a reliable content identifier: they may have one or more content hashes associated to it.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/comments/930654094/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/comments/930655319","html_url":"https://github.com/bio-guoda/preston/issues/135#issuecomment-930655319","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/135","id":930655319,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCMmefs43eKxX","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-30T00:50:26Z","updated_at":"2021-09-30T00:50:26Z","body":"And . . . that these query aliases are defined in a versioned provenance log.
