I suppose we could get away with setting `BUFFER_SIZE` in the order of MBs instead of KBs, then bump the max match size accordingly.","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/comments/718276926/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
