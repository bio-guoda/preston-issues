Can you and Julien please find a temporary solution to get the metadata for the current records, and then in a second step how we can get new uploads to Zenodo transferred to bPMC?\r\n\r\nThe underlying (literature) dataset for the bhl-blr, taxodros and batlit Zenodo communities are available as versioned and signed data packages. So, the deposits in the Zenodo communities are a reflection of the versioned literature datasets (corpora): the originals are found elsewhere. And, these deposits are *not* version controlled, because the metadata can be edited without leaving much of a trace. \r\n\r\nThis is why I propose to implement the following workflow, similar to already existing workflows (e.g., taxodros -> Zenodo, batlit -> Zenodo), where the taxodros, batlit, and bhl-blr corpora are translated into BiodiversityPMC speak. This way, we have a controlled workflow (i.e. working from versioned sources) which we run without having to worry about Web API rate limiting, or other constraints (e.g., search results restricted to 10k). \r\n\r\nHappy to discuss more, please feel free to schedule a meeting. \r\n\r\nCurious to hear your thoughts!\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9dfc535-38fb-4814-97c3-39f6af004a82)\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/310/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/310/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
