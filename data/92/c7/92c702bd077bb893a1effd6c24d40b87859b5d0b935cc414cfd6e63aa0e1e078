This can be just versions of their own collection, combinations of collections or backing up of the entire data portal\nThis can lead to many downstream advantages:\n\n1. Archiving individual collections for improved citations for collections.\n\n    Symbiota portals\n\n    Katie Pearson and crew\n\n2. Creation of pipelines for QC versioned of taxon specific datasets\n  QC quality controlled subset of these large datasets\n  Jenn Yost (domain expert)\n  Erica Krimmel (paleo folks)\n  \n3. Backup of the entire portal (with or without images) and publish on Zenodo (as an example)\n  partner iDigBio (domain specific partner)\n  have to be able to include/exclude images (turn \"it\" off, where \"it\" is  some automated portal archiving/backup workflow that is configurable to include/excludes images0.\n    \nOccurrence Data Use Case\n  \nLiterature Corpora Use Case\n\n3D Bee Models \n\nDocument Origins of Heterogeneous Data Synthesis \n  \nAs a researcher I grab data from different places, build a dataset packaging everything together as a reproducible publications. \n\nPackage all of this in an R-script. \n\n------ \n\nUse Case Aspect (outline a specific challenge in a specific domain)\n\n    - preparing occurrence data sourced from iDigBio/GBIF for a specific taxonomic /geospatial temporal domain\n\n    - occurrence data advanced - combine occurrence data with other sources of data like 3D models, traits etc. to produce synthesized datasets of known, *multiple*, origins spanning different data types/sets.\n\n\nTools/Interactive Aspects (pick some familiar tools and data access methods to facilitate collaboration)\n\n    - bash may not be as familiar as R or Python\n\n    - web based collaboration tools vs. locally installed \n\n\nInvite \"Friends and Family\"\n\n    - botanists (Yost, Pearson, et al.)\n\n    - paleo folks (Krimmel et al.)\n\n    - pollinator (EU Horizon) \n\n    - bee (Seltmann et al.)\n\n\nPick a suitable date, time slot and venue. \n\n    venue - online workshop \n\n    before TDWG, meaning < Oct 2025\n\n    workshop 19-23 Sept 2025\n\n    use Friday meetings as workshop prep (pre-workshop prep, with invites for others)\n\n    send notification before 20 May as part of TDWG abstract submission\n\n    ask folks EU Pollinator/PollRest to sponsor trip TDWG \n\n    promote idea at SPNHC somehow (Katja attending SPNHC  (26-30 May 2025))\n\n\nDocumentation - \n\n    How to document the aims and conclusions - \n\n    Use abstract TDWG to pre-emptively report on the outcomes of the workshop - Datos Vivos Bagota  21-24 Oct 2025 for Datos Vivos/Living Data in Bogotá, Colombia. \n\n    Some kind of manuscript\n\n    Presentation \n\n    Blog post\n\n    Ideally fold this into existing initiatives (Big Bee / EU Horizon Pollinator etc.)\n\n\n\nData archiving \n\nData review and archiving workflow\n\nBook Binding for the Digital Age - Format Agnostic Method to Review and Archive Biodiversity Data\n\n \n\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/333/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/333/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
