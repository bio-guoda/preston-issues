Adult Aedes aegypti were exposed to conidial showers from field-collected chaoborid, tipulid and chironomid cadavers for 24 h under conditions of 100% RH and 15 degrees C. Up to 24% of the adults were killed by the mycosis. Cadavers of Ae. aegypti produced conidia that were infective to other adult Ae. aegypti; however, rates of infection were never more than 12%. Nevertheless, Ae. aegypti served as the laboratory host for E. conica via mosquito-to-mosquito serial passages for up to 6 months. Adult Culex restuans were also susceptible to infection by E. conica.\nER  - \n```\n\nBut ... no abstract is populated in the associated Zenodo record at https://zenodo.org/records/15963115 \n\nfyi @myrmoteras\n\n<img width=\"1323\" height=\"944\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/387eeb43-1e5e-404f-89ed-d50d3fb61dc2\" />","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/359/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/359/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
