If such a flat serialization is necessary for services, we recommend to select from among term names of the form \"AB\" where \"A\" is one of thumbnail, trailer, lowerQuality, mediumQuality, goodQuality, bestQuality, offline and \"B\" is one of AccessURI, Format, Extent, FurtherInformationURL, LicensingException, ServiceExpectation (example: thumbnailAccessURI). Implementers in specific constraint languages such as XML Schema or RDF may wish to make Access URI and perhaps dcterms:format mandatory on instances of the service access point.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/105/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/105/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
