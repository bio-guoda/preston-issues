Preston has more advanced functionality with a richer syntax.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the functionality desired by @zedomel in in https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/globalbioticinteractions/issues/431 (e.g., addressing content within a remote zipfile ```zip:https://example.org/archive.zip!/data.csv```) is already available through the preston functionality. \r\n\r\nSuggest to refactor preston source code so that only the content dereference/addressing functionality can be added as a maven module dependency of elton. This would exclude more Preston specific functionality like pattern matching and similarity matching. \r\n\r\n ","closed_by":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/127/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/127/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
