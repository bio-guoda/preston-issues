Looking back, that number wasn't for \"unique\" contents. Also, my local preston-amazon copy had a long history of whatever tests I had been running, so instead of giving you one of those prov hashes, I just recloned the preston-amazon repo and ran the tests again (latest prov: `hash://sha256/1aa34112ade084ccc8707388fbc329dcb8fae5f895cb266e3ad943f7495740b3`)\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ time preston ls | preston tika | preston similar > out\r\nreal    0m38.741s\r\nuser    0m27.438s\r\nsys     0m14.313s\r\n$ cat out | grep \"#wasDerivedFrom\" | wc -l\r\n532\r\n$ cat out | grep \"#value\" | wc -l\r\n3280\r\n```\r\nAnd if I try again after eliminating duplicate `<tika-tlsh> <derivedFrom> <sha256> .` quads:\r\n```\r\n$ time preston ls | preston tika | grep \"#wasDerivedFrom\" | grep \"hash://tika-tlsh/\" | cut -c-210 |  sed 's/$/ ./' | sort | uniq | preston similar > out\r\nreal    0m17.428s\r\nuser    0m19.641s\r\nsys     0m5.422s\r\n$ cat out | grep \"#wasDerivedFrom\" | wc -l\r\n108\r\n$ cat out | grep \"#value\" | wc -l\r\n50\r\n```\r\nNote that, for both of these tests, the default threshold=100 was used.
