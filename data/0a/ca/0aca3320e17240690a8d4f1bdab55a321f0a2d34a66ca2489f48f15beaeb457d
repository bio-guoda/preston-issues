I will try the released version now as well.\n\nalso a few things stand out in terms of packaging:\n\n* `/usr/local` is generally reserved for locally compiled packages, FHS recommends: `/opt` for third-party packages that are not distro-specific: https://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_3.0/fhs/ch03s13.html\n* Use `/bin/sh` or require `bash` in dependencies\n* `/usr/bin/preston` should be distributed as a file, since it's in a rpm-controlled `/usr/bin`, recommend including a static shell script installed at `/usr/bin/preston` in the RPM:\n   ```\n   #!/bin/sh\n   exec /opt/preston/bin/preston-cli.sh \"$@\"\n   ```\n  Make this file a regular `%file` in your spec, and give it proper permissions `%attr(0755, root, root) /usr/bin/preston`, don't generate it in `%post`.  This is how Chrome, for example, is distributed.  Then when the RPM is uninstalled, the file is removed, and not done in the scriptlets, in general avoid scriplets as much as possible, and the use the built-in RPM features to manage file addition/removal.  I can contribute patches if need be, as I used to maintain Fedora packages.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/comments/2881477409/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/comments/2881494964","html_url":"https://github.com/bio-guoda/preston/issues/332#issuecomment-2881494964","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/332","id":2881494964,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCMmefs6rwB-0","user":{"login":"alexlancaster","id":5281946,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODE5NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5281946?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexlancaster","html_url":"https://github.com/alexlancaster","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexlancaster/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexlancaster/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexlancaster/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexlancaster/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexlancaster/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexlancaster/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexlancaster/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexlancaster/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexlancaster/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-05-14T20:34:30Z","updated_at":"2025-05-14T20:34:30Z","body":"testing upgrade path to released 0.10.7:\n\n```\nPackage                                                          Arch           Version                                                          Repository                               Size\nUpgrading:\n preston                                                         noarch         0.10.7-1                                                         @commandline                         50.5 MiB\n   replacing preston                                             noarch         0.10.7-SNAPSHOT20250513205348                                    @commandline                         50.5 MiB\n\nTransaction Summary:\n Upgrading:          1 package\n Replacing:          1 package\n\nTotal size of inbound packages is 45 MiB.
