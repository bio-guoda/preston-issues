Nor can we necessarily rely on hashes, given that publishers often generate uniquely stamped PDFs when users download the PDF (so that hashes of the \"same\" content need not match).

Likewise we typically cite works rather than particular representations.\r\n\r\nThank you for referencing the \"Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records\" (FRBR) model as a way to express what you mean when you say \"publication\". So, if I understand it correctly, you see publications equivalent to \"works\" as mentioned in FRBR's \r\n\r\n> \"[...] Group 1 entities are work, expression, manifestation, and item (WEMI). They represent the products of intellectual or artistic endeavor. [...]\"\r\n\r\nSo, relating this to what I asked you on 26 Sept 2023 in https://hypothes.is/a/sS42-FykEe6WVyMSoSL2vA, namely,\r\n\r\n\r\n> Additional questions would be: How would you reference an abstract idea? By a particular physical/digital piece of evidence that reflects that idea? And, could such a piece of evidence be a publication?\r\n\r\nI understand you think of a publication as the following: A bibliographic reference points to a work, and a DOI is an identifier for *a work*. \r\n\r\nAnd. . . according to the definition, a work is related to their expressions, manifestations (did you mean to say \"manifestations\" instead of  \"representations\"?), and items. As far as I understand manifestations and items are physical objects (e.g., a digital copy), whereas works and expressions are non-physical. \r\n\r\nSo, when you are citing a work, you are citing not just the work, but also their expressions, manifestations, and items. How else do you know that this work exists without encountering some manifestation of it? And, as you implied, there are many such manifestations and items, especially when publishers inject banner ads or some kind of watermark into the digital copies that they issue. And because are likely many manifestations and items (e.g., rendered HTML pages, watermarked PDFs) related to a single work, describing the work fully becomes a rather involved task - you'd have to track all copies. One way to cite the work is to point to some abstract, unverifiable object like a DOI, or a text fragment formatted as a bibliographic citation. In their current use, I can see how a DOI points to a work without expressions, manifestations or items. With this, a DOI _technically_ cites something that only exists in the abstract. In other words, a DOI doesn't point to anything physical, but instead is more like an axiom, some abstract idea. \r\n\r\nAnd, as far as I understand, the reader _expects_ an item to manifest itself after \"clicking on\" (or materializing?) a DOI: the reader expects a *item*, whereas the DOI only points into some abstract space, leaving some server that handles a DOI resolve request to pull something up that they interpret to be a manifestation of the associated DOI. And this forces the reader to _trust_ the server (or whenever presents some item) to be perfect. \r\n\r\nAnd, in my experience, communication networks and the servers and the humans that power them, are far from perfect. Not only that, when dealing with large amounts of DOIs, violations of trust (willingly or not) are to be expected and will accumulate over time, rendering \"big data\" analysis on referenced works untrustworthy and expensive to fact check. \r\n\r\nSo, this is why I am advocating to add at least one content identifier to a digital \"item\" (a specific copy of a manifestation of an expression of a work): to enable \"big data\" analysis on scientific corpora. And one such analysis can be as simple as: given two copies corpus consisting of 1TiB across millions of digital files, I'd like to show that they are the *exact* items as cited in a single bibliographic citation using a commonly available resources (e.g., internet connection, a laptop) and a little time (hours/days). \r\n \r\nPerhaps I can phrase my desire to be specific when citing works with digital items in a question:\r\n\r\nHow do you imagine enabling large scale data analysis without being able to verify that an item (or copy) of a cited digital corpus is authentic?\r\n\r\n-jorrit\r\n\r\nPS As far as you commenting an item of your work related to https://doi.org/10.3897/BDJ.11.e107914 via https://bdj.pensoft.net/article/107914/download/pdf/ . . . why not say, hey, I am commenting on this specific item retrieved from https://bdj.pensoft.net/article/107914/download/pdf/ with hash://sha256/7abbc8d544bc43734dbe524fe78f4c1ba93ae74cce6a8bc886f916a71896c8fe and hash://md5/435643f61997c3006e24d793ec29917b to say something like:\r\n\r\nPage R (2023) Ten years and a million links: building a global taxonomic library connecting persistent identifiers for names, publications and people.

Right now, I am left with trust, but cannot verify. Perhaps not a big issue now that pdf is still \"warm\", but what about 5 years, 50 years from now? Or if Pensoft decides to no longer server copies of your paper? \r\n\r\n[page2023.pdf](https://github.com/bio-guoda/preston/files/12951125/page2023.pdf)\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/comments/1767047819/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/comments/1767122299","html_url":"https://github.com/bio-guoda/preston/issues/259#issuecomment-1767122299","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/259","id":1767122299,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCMmefs5pVCV7","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-17T20:30:00Z","updated_at":"2023-10-17T20:30:00Z","body":"cross posted via https://hypothes.is/a/65ArJm0qEe67IEOtGBnYAg (see also screenshot below).\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/bio-guoda/preston/assets/1084872/47db723d-8573-4d65-adcd-c27984543dcf)\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/comments/1767122299/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/comments/1768239498","html_url":"https://github.com/bio-guoda/preston/issues/259#issuecomment-1768239498","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/259","id":1768239498,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCMmefs5pZTGK","user":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-18T11:20:44Z","updated_at":"2023-10-18T11:20:44Z","body":"via https://hypothes.is/a/V9DjuG2NEe6TI3c3SAp42w @rdmpage responded -\r\n\r\n> @jhpoelen1829 You might find [Digital Object Identifiers: Promise and Problems for Scholarly Publishing](https://doi.org/10.3998/3336451.0004.203) interesting. The origins of DOIs are in managing access to intellectual property assets, typically behind paywalls.
