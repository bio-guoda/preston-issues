I'm forgetting how to use this thing, and it makes me feel bad for newcomers\r\n\r\nHere's some starting points:\r\n1. Document support for our Apache VFS-style content addressing - `gz:` etc. to address (de)compressed content, `tar:` `zip:` etc. to address to files in archives, `line:` `cut:` etc. to address (ranges/sets of) lines and bytes\r\n1. Add some basic use-case examples in `preston help` and/or `preston man`, not just to show what commands do, but how they work together. At the very least we can point to https://github.com/bio-guoda/preston#command-line-tool etc. and hope this URL persists\r\n1. Make it clear which commands alter/append to the provenance graph\r\n1. Describe how commands read from stdin when applicable\r\n1. Specify that preston uses Java-style regexes\r\n1. Keep option naming consistent, e.g. `--provenanceRoot, --provenanceAnchor` should be hyphenated instead of camel case\r\n1. Tab completion https://picocli.info/autocomplete.html\r\n2. Probably some other stuff I missed\r\n\r\nI'm not so much suggesting to immediately address all of these points, but I think we should keep them in mind going forward. I do appreciate all the work that has already been put into the help & man pages, I only noticed this stuff because I use them so much 🥇 ","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/247/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/247/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
