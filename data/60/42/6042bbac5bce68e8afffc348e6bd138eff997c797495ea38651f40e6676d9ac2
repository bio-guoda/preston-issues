When a match crosses the buffer boundary, if the substring from the start of the match up to the buffer boundary is a valid match, it gets reported as a match. Correct behavior would be to not report that match, and instead refill the buffer and continue searching until the true end of the match is found.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ echo \"<http://ipt.vertnet.org:8080/ipt/archive.do?r=dmn> <http://purl.org/pav/hasVersion> <hash://sha256/d762847b58b14f1ebe305698d109b231b346fff714f9ca4189da2f4ee00fec85> .\" | preston match\r\n...\r\n<cut:zip:hash://sha256/314575f66a10953a3cc5c6c8db4df74c593a878090f2387ee02fbcdd85ebcd2f!/multimedia.txt!/b472408-472415> <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#value> \"http://a\" <4a5ffdb6-61ff-46a2-9b3a-80665f965799> .\r\n...\r\n```\r\nThe reported location for the match is correct:\r\n```\r\npreston get hash://sha256/314575f66a10953a3cc5c6c8db4df74c593a878090f2387ee02fbcdd85ebcd2f > content\r\n$ unzip -p content multimedia.txt | cut -z -b472408-472415\r\nhttp://a\r\n```\r\nBut extending the byte range proves that the match is incomplete:\r\n```\r\n$ unzip -p content multimedia.txt | cut -z -b472408-472456\r\nhttp://arctos.database.museum/media/10604282?open\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"mielliott","id":9602463,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MDI0NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9602463?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mielliott","html_url":"https://github.com/mielliott","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mielliott/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mielliott/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mielliott/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mielliott/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mielliott/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mielliott/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mielliott/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mielliott/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mielliott/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/84/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/84/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
