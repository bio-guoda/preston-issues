We rely on the hOCR content to place the text on the PDF page. The IA items associated with the 3400 PDFs are missing their hOCR content and are failing to derive that content. Each of those items requires some amount of personal attention to investigate and fix the item and derive the hOCR. We've corrected some of them recently (list attached) but more remains to be done as time permits.\n\n[fixed-pdfs.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21868152/fixed-pdfs.txt)","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/comments/3202218070/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
