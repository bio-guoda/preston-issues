This second delay is a facultative response to prolonged torporlinked to cool conditions and associated decreases in food availabilities. Gestation lasts &#xA2;.4 months in tropical populations and &#xA2;.8-5 months in northernmost populations; these northern populations have c.2 months of delayed implantation, c.3 months of delayed development, and 3-5 months of fetal growth. Populations in temperate mild climates, intermediate between these two extremes, only have a few months of delayed implantation. In any case, it seems that births in all populations are synchronized during short periods of time. In \r\n<collectingCountry box=\"[853,940,2570,2603]\" name=\"Japan\" pageId=\"2\" pageNumber=\"693\">Japan</collectingCountry>\r\n, copulation takes place in autumn, and births occur synchronously from late June to earlyJuly.

Sex ratio is even during their first 2-3 months oflife. It has been suggested that young are nursed communally, probably related to enormous size of the breeding colony (100,000-200,000 individuals). Lactating females are found until mid-August. By mid-October, young are the size and weight of adults. Sexual maturity of females is not reached until they are at least 20 months old and males at &#xA2;.19 months old.\r\n</paragraph>\r\n    </subSubSection>\r\n    <subSubSection pageId=\"2\" pageNumber=\"693\" type=\"activity\">\r\n      <paragraph blockId=\"2.[116,1329,1031,3234]\" lastBlockId=\"2.[1392,2608,282,1821]\" pageId=\"2\" pageNumber=\"693\"><emphasis bold=\"true\" box=\"[116,359,3004,3037]\" pageId=\"2\" pageNumber=\"693\">Activity patterns.</emphasis>\r\nIn Ohse-do Cave (Kyushu district, \r\n<geoCoordinate box=\"[890,974,3004,3037]\" degrees=\"32\" direction=\"north\" orientation=\"latitude\" pageId=\"2\" pageNumber=\"693\" precision=\"55555\" value=\"32.0\">32&#xB0; N</geoCoordinate>\r\n) in \r\n<collectingCountry box=\"[1039,1126,3004,3037]\" name=\"Japan\" pageId=\"2\" pageNumber=\"693\">Japan</collectingCountry>\r\n, Asian Longfingered Bats started vocalizing c.1-2 hours before emerging from the cave. Such an early awakening is probably due to endogenous activity rhythm, and light sampling behavior could be seen a few minutes before individuals emerged. Emergence time was synchronized with sunset and correlated with appearance of prey. Asian Longfingered Bats are most active soon after sunset in early spring and late autumn and secondarily active before sunrise. This activity pattern seems to correspond to their feeding pattern. Feeding in summer lasted until c.02:00 h. There is always some activity during winter. When temperature at dusk is less than 7&#xB0;C, activity is greatly reduced, but when it is 7-13&#xB0;C,at least one-half of the colony becomes active. During periods of winter activity, Asian Long-fingered Bats must be foraging because fresh feces appear under colonies. Hibernation begins in December and ends at the end of February. In late autumn, body fat begins to rapidly increase and reaches maximum values at the end of November (weight 15-16 g for adults and 13-9-14-5 g for young). At the end of February when hibernation ends, body weights are 11-5-12-5 g for adults and 10-8-11-2 g for young. During this period, individuals select in the coldest areas of the cave with temperatures of 68&#xB0;C and maintain their body temperatures to less than one degree above ambient temperatures. Tropical populations do not hibernate. The Asian Long-fingered Bat typically roosts in caves but also uses abandoned mines, tunnels, and similar structures such as underground channels. Echolocation calls have downward FM signals.

Monotypic. | NE Australia endemic, in WC, C & E Queensland. | Head-body 79-4-86-3 mm, tail 31-5-36-9 mm, ear 22-4-27-1 mm, hindfoot 9-8-10-3 mm, forearm 73-76 mm; weight. 20-29 g. Dorsum of Troughton’s Sheath-tailed Bat is predominately olive­ brown, with pale mouse-gray guard hairs. Venter surface hairs are olive-brown from chin to shoulders and posteriorly dark yellow-brown, with guard hairs of pale mouse-gray. Uropatagium close to abdomen is heavily furred. Throat pouches are absent, and radio-metacarpal sacs are present in both sexes. Skin of rhinarium, wings, uropatagium, lips, face, and tragus are fuscous (pale yellow). | Wide variety of habitats and bioregions of interior Queensland. | Troughton’s Sheath-tailed Bats forage for insects well above tree canopies and high over open habitats. Large, high-flying grasshoppers are preferred food items and often taken back to cave roosts to eat. | No information. | Troughton’s Sheath-tailed Bat roosts in caves, mines and tunnels, rock crevices, and rocky escarpments. Echolocation call is less than 25 kHz and distinguishes it from the Common Sheath-tailed Bat (. georgianus ) where they co-occur. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Large colonies of Troughton’s Sheath-tailed Bat can be found in landscapes with abundant rocky outcrops, especially in tower karst. Colony size might be limited by roosting structures, especially in more arid areas where there are few caves deep enough to support large colonies. |   | Classified as Least Concern on TheIUCNRed List. Troughton’s Sheath-tailed Bat has a large distribution and presumably large and stable overall population, uses a wide variety of habitats, occurs in protected areas, and does not face significant threats. It was originally recorded only from a small area in the Mount Isa Inland bioregion of Queensland, but recent studies based on isozymes and echolocation calls extend distribution further east throughout much of interior and near coastal region of central Queensland, formerly attributed to the Common Sheathtailed Bat. Recent reports of absence of Troughton’s Sheath-tailed Bat in western parts of its distribution require additional verification, possibly leading to re-evaluation of its conservation status after taxonomic issues are clarified. | Chimimba & Kitchener (1991), Hall (2008b), McKean & Price (1967), Reardon & Thomson (2002), Tate (1952),Thomson eta /.
