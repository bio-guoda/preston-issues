Let's try to grep on something that obviously doesn't exist:\r\n```\r\n$ echo \"<blah> <http://purl.org/pav/hasVersion> <hash://sha256/0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000>\r\n.\" | preston grep\r\n<urn:uuid:aec383b2-cf32-4871-b1cc-7de0b1cd25d9> <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#Activity> <urn:uuid:aec383b2-cf32-4871-b1cc-7de0b1cd25d9> .\r\n<urn:uuid:aec383b2-cf32-4871-b1cc-7de0b1cd25d9> <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#used> <hash://sha256/0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000> <urn:uuid:aec383b2-cf32-4871-b1cc-7de0b1cd25d9> .\r\n<urn:uuid:aec383b2-cf32-4871-b1cc-7de0b1cd25d9> <http://purl.org/dc/terms/description> \"An activity that finds the locations of text matching the regular expression '(?:https?|ftp|file)://[-a-zA-Z0-9+&@#/%?=~_|!:,.;]*[-a-zA-Z0-9+&@#/%=~_|]' inside any encountered content (e.g., hash://sha256/... identifiers).\"@en <urn:uuid:aec383b2-cf32-4871-b1cc-7de0b1cd25d9> .\r\n```\r\nThe output suggests that the content `hash://sha256/0000...` was processed but contained no matches, when in fact the content was never processed because it couldn't be found. It's possible that the content identified by `hash://sha256/0000...` really does contain matches that should have been reported. When a hash identifier can't be dereferenced, I suggest to either\r\n1. throw an error and stop everything\r\n1. throw an error, output some statements indicating the dereferencing failure, and keep processing\r\n\r\nCommands like `preston history`, `preston ls`, and `preston cat` throw dereferencing failures for hash identifiers, so I would expect others to do the same","closed_by":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/130/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/130/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
