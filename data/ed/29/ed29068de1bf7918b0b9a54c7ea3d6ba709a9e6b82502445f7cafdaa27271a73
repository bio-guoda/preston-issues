We can use this to track which activities informed others.\r\n\r\nProposed implementation:\r\n1. The first statement emitted by a named activity should be a declaration of the activity (something like ```activityUUID isA Activity```)\r\n2. The activity declaration and any statements that follow should use the activity name as a temporary graph label (.e.g. ```_:activityUUID```)\r\n3. If a future activity is informed by a statement possessing a graph label, the future activity may identify the activity that produced the statement by referencing the graph label of the statement and emitting ```newActivityUUID wasInformedBy activityUUID```\r\n4. Once an ```activityUUID endedAt timeLiteral``` is seen by an Activity Tracker (new!), the activity's statements should be serialized and hashed, then the ```_:activityUUID``` labels should be replaced by the resulting hash (```hash://sha256/abc...```)\r\n5. On ```preston reprocess```, the ```hash://sha256/abc...``` graph labels should be translated back into the original ```activityUUID``` to allow future activities to reference the activity responsible for an informative statement\r\n\r\n@jhpoelen this proposed implementation is how I understood our ideas from https://github.com/bio-linker/organization/wiki/2020-03-06-Work-Session-Notes; please holler if you think I missed or misunderstood anything.","closed_by":{"login":"mielliott","id":9602463,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MDI0NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9602463?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mielliott","html_url":"https://github.com/mielliott","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mielliott/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mielliott/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mielliott/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mielliott/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mielliott/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mielliott/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mielliott/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mielliott/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mielliott/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/41/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/41/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
