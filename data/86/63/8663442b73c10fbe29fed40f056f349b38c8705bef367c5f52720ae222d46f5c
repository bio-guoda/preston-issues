This requires at least `(n^2)/2` computations. I'd like to be able to do a \"one-to-all\" comparison, to compute the intersection of every sketch with one specific sketch, which should require only `n` computations. Maybe we could allow users to specify one sketch to be compared with all sketches found in the input, e.g.\r\n```\r\n$ preston ls | preston grep | preston bloom | preston diff hash://sha256/abc...\r\n```\r\nso that every hash streamed into `preston diff` will only be intersected with the bloom filter identified by `hash://sha256/abc...`. If no hash is specified, then default to the current \"all-to-all\" behavior.\r\n\r\n## Use case\r\n\r\nI'd like to be able to use bloom filters/theta sketches to quickly find all datasets that contain at least one of a large set of terms that I'm looking for. For example, if I have a list of 1000 species names, I would\r\n1. compute a bloom filter for that set of names; let's say the filter is saved as `hash://sha256/def...`\r\n1. use `preston ls | preston grep [some regex] | preston bloom | preston diff hash://sha256/def` to find which datasets contain at least one of those 1000 species names","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/129/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/129/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
