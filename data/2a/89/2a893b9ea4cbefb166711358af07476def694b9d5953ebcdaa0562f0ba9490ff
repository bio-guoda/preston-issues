The RFS supports a structured methodology to assess the viability of digital formats within both a global and institutional context. These efforts are [part of the Library’s strategy](https://www.loc.gov/acq/devpol/Digital%20Collections%20Strategy%20Overview_final.pdf) to collect and engage fully with the breadth of digital creative works.\r\n\r\nIn this 2023-2024 edition, there are notable changes to a few of the content categories, especially [Software and Video Games](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/resources/rfs/software-videogames.html?loclr=blogsig) and [Web Archives](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/resources/rfs/webarchives.html?loclr=blogsig), as well as some changes in file formats included for [Still Image Works](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/resources/rfs/stillimg.html?loclr=blogsig) and [Design and 3D](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/resources/rfs/design3D.html?loclr=blogsig). Following the lead of the [Federal Agencies Digital Guidelines Initiative (FADGI)](https://www.digitizationguidelines.gov/), the RFS now uses the term master/primary rather than the term master, except for where master is part of a format’s formal name or an industry standard use.\r\n\r\nAlso new this year the format evaluation matrix has an added focus on options for access through the Library’s systems including support on the Library’s public website, [loc.gov](https://loc.gov/?loclr=blogsig) (as well as for Stacks, an onsite-only system for accessing restricted digital content). The outcome of this analytical structure are clearer definitions of ‘Preferred’ and ‘Acceptable’ when categorizing digital file formats in the RFS. (The updated [evaluation matrix with sample data](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/resources/rfs/LC-RFS-FormatEvaluationMatrixTemplate_2023.xlsx) is available for download. A full list of all changes is shared in the [Change Log](https://www.loc.gov/preservation/resources/rfs/RFS-ChangeLog-2023.pdf) available on the RFS home page.)\r\n\r\nYour comments remain crucial to the ongoing improvements and success of the RFS.
