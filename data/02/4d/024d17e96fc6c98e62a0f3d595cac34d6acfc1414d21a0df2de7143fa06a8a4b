features\r\n```\r\n\r\nApplying this to our case, you'd start with:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<http://example.org/a> <..hasVersion> <hash://sha256/abc...> .\r\n...\r\n<http://example.org/b> <..hasVersion> <hash://sha256/def...> .\r\n```\r\n\r\nafter applying tika-tlsh hashes, you might get:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<hash://tika-tlsh/1234...> <..derivedFrom> <hash://sha256/abc> .\r\n<hash://tika-tlsh/1233...> <..derivedFrom> <hash://sha256/def> .\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, after realizing that ```distance( <hash://tika-tlsh/1234...> , <hash://tika-tlsh/1233...> ) < C``` (where ```distance()``` is some function that calculates the distance between two tika-tlsh hashes and ```C``` is some chosen distance constant), we express that ```<hash://tika-tlsh/1234...>``` is similar to ```<hash://tika-tlsh/1233...>```
