(2025). Versioned Archive and Review of Biotic Interactions and Taxon Names Found within globalbioticinteractions/scan hash://md5/58de50154e330c331993fe5d0852ad84. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16894884\n\ncontains prov.nq with cryptographic hash hash://md5/58de50154e330c331993fe5d0852ad84 .\n\nAlso, it contains data.zip with content referenced in the Preston Data BOM. \n\nI'd like to be able to discover the content associated using something like:\n\n```\npreston ls \\\n --remote https://zenodo.org \\\n --anchor hash://md5/58de50154e330c331993fe5d0852ad84 \\\n| preston dwc-stream \\\n --remote https://zenodo.org \\\n --anchor hash://md5/58de50154e330c331993fe5d0852ad84\n```\n\nto stream all SCAN darwin core records in line json format. \n\nCurrently, you can do this by:\n\n```bash\ncurl -L https://zenodo.org/records/16894884/files/data.zip >  data.zip\nunzip data.zip\npreston ls\\\n --anchor hash://md5/58de50154e330c331993fe5d0852ad84\\\n| preston dwc-stream\n```\n\nSo, suggest to implement method that locates a data.zip file and attempts to resolve content from within it.
