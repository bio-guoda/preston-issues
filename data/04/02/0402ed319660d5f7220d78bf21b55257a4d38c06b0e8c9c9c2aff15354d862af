Similar to how git is a content-addressable *filesystem* with a version control system user interface written on top of it:\r\n\r\nfrom https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Plumbing-and-Porcelain\r\n\r\n> Now that you’re here, let’s get started. First, if it isn’t yet clear, Git is fundamentally a content-addressable filesystem with a VCS user interface written on top of it. You’ll learn more about what this means in a bit.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Preston help to keep track of versions by a forward index implemented via a simple hexastore. \r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, with recent changes, you can list the provenance of a provided version using:\r\n\r\n```\r\npreston origins --anchor hash://sha256/05a877bdb8617144fe166a13bf51828d4ad1bc11631c360b9e648a9f7df2bbcd \r\n```\r\n\r\nyielding\r\n\r\n```\r\n<hash://sha256/05a877bdb8617144fe166a13bf51828d4ad1bc11631c360b9e648a9f7df2bbcd> <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#wasDerivedFrom> <hash://sha256/7efdea9263e57605d2d2d8b79ccd26a55743123d0c974140c72c8c1cfc679b93> .\r\n<hash://sha256/7efdea9263e57605d2d2d8b79ccd26a55743123d0c974140c72c8c1cfc679b93> <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#wasDerivedFrom> <hash://sha256/b83cf099449dae3f633af618b19d05013953e7a1d7d97bc5ac01afd7bd9abe5d> .\r\n<hash://sha256/b83cf099449dae3f633af618b19d05013953e7a1d7d97bc5ac01afd7bd9abe5d> <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#wasDerivedFrom> <hash://sha256/c253a5311a20c2fc082bf9bac87a1ec5eb6e4e51ff936e7be20c29c8e77dee55> .\r\n<urn:uuid:0659a54f-b713-4f86-a917-5be166a14110> <http://purl.org/pav/hasVersion> <hash://sha256/c253a5311a20c2fc082bf9bac87a1ec5eb6e4e51ff936e7be20c29c8e77dee55> .\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere ```hash://sha256/05a877bdb8617144fe166a13bf51828d4ad1bc11631c360b9e648a9f7df2bbcd ``` is the content id of the  Preston archive.\r\n\r\nThe origins of the archive version (or graph version) is computed from the content id pointing to the version by first resolving the version content, and then resolving the content id related to the \"used\" relations. \r\n\r\nThe forward index is generated when new versions are appended to existing ones. So, whereas the provenance of a known graph version can be computed, the forward index is used to explore which other version exist (now or in the future) that use the known graph version. Here the latest known graph version is stored in the forward index, whereas the back index (or known provenance) of a graph version is embedded in the content itself. Obviously, you can only reference things that exist, and can only guess which, as of yet unknown (or future) graph version may use our current graph version. The forward index was introduced as a way to define a common starting point across all graphs to help facilitate traversal/discovery of (as of yet unknown) graph versions.
