I believe that our paper has some roots in classic 1945 essay \"As We May Think\" by Vannevar Bush [2] as well as the 1974 Computer Lib/Dream Machines by Ted Nelson [3] - in advocating for a more \"intertwingled\" approach to recording the complex webs of the knowledge we keep and explore. \r\n\r\nBig thanks to @mielliott and many others that have contributed to the development of these (not so new?) ideas, including, but not limited to @btrask @cboettig @seltmann @slint @mbjones @tkuhn, @Daniel-Mietchen and more recently, @GregPost-ASU, @nfranz, and @n8upham. Also, thanks for open infrastructures such as Zenodo @slint (#210 ), The Internet Archive, Software Heritage Library (#70 ) @zacchiro @rdicosmo, DataOne (#181 ) @mbjones, and last but not least, GitHub and their excellent platform to develop open source software/data*.\r\n\r\nPlease do share your thoughts on the topic of building a media and format agnostic content-addressed knowledge universe. \r\n\r\n## References \r\n\r\n[1] Elliott, M.J., Poelen, J.H. & Fortes, J.A.B.
