Are these merely a by-product of DwC-A files, a technological response to poor performance when paging through large XML documents? Are datasets for primary specimen data adding value or are they merely artificial, convenient wrappers? A dataset for tertiary or derived data makes sense because it's a citable unit, constructed in support of a publication or sets of publications. But primary specimen data are necessarily volatile. If they remained static, I'd question whether or not there's any activity in the collection or if they have the capacity to respond to user requests. I have yet to see a compelling reason for retaining versions for primary specimen datasets except perhaps to do some digital archaeology and sort out problems.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jhpoelen","id":1084872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODQ4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1084872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen","html_url":"https://github.com/jhpoelen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhpoelen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/49/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/49/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
