This data publication provides interpreted species interaction data products. These products are the result of a process in which versioned, existing species interaction datasets ([2]) are linked to the so-called GloBI Taxon Graph ([3]) and transformed into various aggregate formats (e.g., tsv, csv, neo4j, rdf/nquad, darwin core-ish archives). In addition, the applied name maps are included to make the applied taxonomic linking explicit. \r\n\r\nCitation\r\n--------\r\n\r\nGloBI is made possible by researchers, collections, projects and institutions openly sharing their datasets. When using this data, please make sure to attribute these *original data contributors*, including citing the specific datasets in derivative work. Each species interaction record indexed by GloBI contains a reference and dataset citation. Also, a full lists of all references can be found in citations.csv/citations.tsv files in this publication. If you have ideas on how to make it easier to cite original datasets, please open/join a discussion via https://globalbioticinteractions.org or related projects.\r\n\r\nTo credit GloBI for more easily finding interaction data, please use the following citation to reference GloBI:\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut, note that #210 appears to prevent retrieval of content of non-latest version by their md5 content hash.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bio-guoda/preston/issues/comments/1364138049/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
