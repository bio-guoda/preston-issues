application/eml | cut -f 1 > emls.tsv\r\n\r\nI meant to say:\r\n\r\npreston ls --log tsv | grep application/eml | cut -f 1 > emls.tsv\r\n\r\nand your solution to remove the <> characters would work also.\r\n\r\nWhich example do you prefer best? \r\n\r\nHappy to go either way, and eager to accept your pull
