Instead, intermediary content libraries / resolvers / services can help to continue to get the referenced content. Also, the infrastructure folks would have to worry less about making sure that all the URLs they've ever issued are redirected to their associated content for years to come. I imagine that a ton of work is needed to keep these redirects working and to keep track of giant lists of historic URLs. And even with all that work, 404s are likely to keep happening.\r\n\r\nNote that I was still able to get a copy of a scientific dataset, like a historical CO2 Record from the Vostok Ice Core, by asking for their content id: https://linker.bio/hash://md5/e27c99a7f701dab97b7d09c467acf468 via DataOne instead of Zenodo, showing how redundancy helps to increase reliability.
