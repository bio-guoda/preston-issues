Populations of Plains Pocket Gopher also are known from oak-hickory savannas, mesquite prairies, and patches of deciduous forest surrounded by prairie habitats. Habitat preferences appear to be based more on soil type than vegetation, with individuals avoiding soils with less than 40% sand content or more than 30% clay and silt content.	The Plains Pocket Gopheris a feeding generalist, and its diet consists of roots, tubers, stems, and leaves of most plants available within the vicinity of its burrow system. Stomachs of pocket gophers collected in Minnesota contained 94% grasses and 6% forbs, dominated by true grasses such as bromus ( Bromus sp. ), crested wheatgrass ( Agropyron sp. ), oats (Avenasp.), bluegrass ( Poa sp. ), and fleabane (Lrigeron sp., Asteraceae ). In Illinois, the Plains Pocket Gopher commonly feeds on sweet clover (Melilotusofficinalis, Fabaceae ), alfalfa ( Medicago sativa, Fabaceae ), bluegrass ( Poa sp. ), and dandelions ( Taraxacum sp. , Asteraceae ). Food stores recovered from one burrow system in eastern Kansas, contained only tubers of sunflowers ( Helianthus tuberosus, Asteraceae ), and food stores in a nearby burrow system were composed entirely of exotic Johnson grass ( Sorghum halepense, Poaceae ). The Plains Pocket Gopher readily invades cultivated fields and is considered an agricultural pest whereverit occurs in contact with humans.

In Louisiana, the subspecies breviceps is found only in deep,rich alluvial soils, whereas the subspecies sagittalis is found in open prairie grasslands and clearings in pine-oak woodlands.	Baird's Pocket Gopheris a feeding generalist, and its diet consists of roots, tubers, stems, and leaves of most plants available within the vicinity of its burrow system.

The Camas Pocket Gopheris widely considered an agricultural pest and is frequently subjected to intensive eradication efforts, including trapping and poisoning.	Diet of the Camas Pocket Gopheris heavily biased toward roots of false dandelion ( Hypochaeris radicata, Asteraceae ), vetch ( Vicia sp. , Fabaceae ), plantains ( Plantago sp. , Plantaginaceae ), grasses, and root crops, including carrots, parsnips, and potatoes. Many captured individuals smell heavily of onion, indicating that wild onions ( Allium amplectens, Amaryllidaceae ) are eaten frequently. Bulbs of common camas ( Camassia quamash, Asparagaceae ) also form part of the diet. As in all other pocket gophers, the burrow system is a series of shallow feeding tunnels radiating spoke-like from a deeper, central network that contains one or more nest chambers and several smaller chambersfor storage of food or fecal pellets. In a study of 16 excavated burrow systems, tunnels were located 8-91 cm beneath the surface, and diameter of tunnels were 5-13 cm. Because soils occupied by the Camas Pocket Gopher can become exceptionally hard when dry, it digs primarily with its large, procumbent incisors rather than its forefeet and claws. Individuals forage on the surface 1-2 m from burrow entrances; during these surface forays, they use incisors to cut 5-7 cm sections of food plants, which are placed in their cheek pouches and returned to burrows. These cuttings are either consumed immediately or placed in storage chambers within the burrow system.

Botta’s Pocket Gophers are common in mountain meadows and tundra, sagebrush ( Artemisia , Asteraceae ) steppes, grasslands,forests, and suburban lawns and gardens. Similar to other pocket gophers, they appear to prefer deep soils in meadows and along rivers and streams, and they are common invadersof cultivated fields.	Diet of Botta’s Pocket Gopher consists of a wide variety of underground roots and tubers and a limited amount of surface vegetation. Nearly all species of plants in the vicinity of a burrow system are consumed, including annual and perennial monocots and dicots, perennial shrubs, cacti, and roots of a variety of tree species. Young shoots and entire seedlings of many plant species are pulled directly downward into a tunnel excavated beneath the plant. In many habitats, diet shifts seasonally, often in response to increased availabilities of forbs and grasses following spring rains. As in all other pocket gophers, the burrow system of Botta’s Pocket Gopher consists of a series of shallow feeding tunnels radiating spoke-like from a deeper, central network that contains one or more nest chambers and several smaller chambers for storage of food or fecal pellets. Many observations of aboveground foraging have been reported, almost always occurring within a few body lengths of a burrow entrance.			Botta’s Pocket Gopheris active at any hour of the day, with periods of peak activity around dawn and dusk. A study in southern California showed six individuals to be active an average of ¢.9 hours/day, with peak activity between 16:00 h and 20:00 h. Botta’s Pocket Gopher digs with its incisors and forelimbs, using hard enamel in the teeth to penetrate compact soils resistant to softer keratin in claws. In one study, growth rate of incisors averaged c.0-6 mm/day for the upper pair and almost 1 mm/day (36 cm/year) in the lower pair. Rate of claw growth varies widely butis usually slower than rate of incisor growth in species that dig with their teeth. Botta’s Pocket Gopher does not hibernate and is active year-round. Burrowing activity is low during hot, dry summers but increases dramatically with cooler temperatures and greater soil moisture in spring, autumn, and winter. Although most burrowing activity takes place in shallow feeding tunnels and is associated with foraging, individuals will also dig deep tunnels to avoid hot surface temperatures.

Surface feeding activity in the immediate vicinity of the borrow entrance has been reported for the Western Pocket Gopher. Feeding habits of the Western Pocket Gopher, particularly the numerous mounds of soil deposited on the surface, are believed by some researchers to have contributed to the formation of what are known as Mima mounds in prairie regions of Oregon and Washington in western USA. Mima mounds are conspicuous mounds of soil varying greatly in size but averaging c.600 cm in diameter and ¢.100 cm high that occur in dense clusters and cover large areas of prairie habitat. Mounds are approximately evenly spaced, and spacing is roughly equivalent to size of individual pocket gopher burrow systems. Pocket gophers no longer occupy the vast majority of Mima mounds.

As in all other pocket gophers,the burrow system is a series of shallow feeding tunnels radiating spoke-like from a deeper, central network that contains one or more nest chambers and several smaller chambersfor storage of food or fecal pellets. Surface feeding activity in the immediate vicinity of the borrow entrance has been reported for the Idaho Pocket Gopher.			The Idaho Pocket Gopher does not hibernate and is active yearround. In winter,it digs tunnels in snow, where it deposits excess soil. When snow melts in spring, these rope-like tubes ofsoil settle to the ground,leaving evidence of an individual's winter activities. As in all species of pocket gophers, Idaho Pocket Gophers can be active at any hour of the day, with periods of peak activity at dawn and dusk.

Northern Pocket Gophers are common in mountain meadows and tundra, sagebrush ( Artemisia , Asteraceae ) steppes, grasslands, forests, and suburban lawns and gardens from elevations of 900 m to more than 3700 m. They appear to prefer deep soils in meadows and along rivers and streams, and they are common invaders of cultivated fields. An unknown number of Northern Pocket Gophers survived the explosive eruption of Mount St. Helens, Washington, in May 1980. Although these individuals were among the first mammals to occupy the devastated wastelands surrounding the volcano, adult survivorship in the year after the eruption was estimated at only 10%, a value much lower than the typical 18-70% survivorship measured in undisturbed populations of Northern Pocket Gophers in Utah.	Diet of the Northern Pocket Gopher consists of underground roots and tubers and a limited amount of surface vegetation. In Oregon, and probably throughout its distribution, the Northern Pocket Gopher will eat most succulent plants within its home range. Although in some habitats, plant species are consumed approximately in proportion to their abundance, one study showed that pocket gophers are able to select plants with higher levels of protein and fat. In Colorado, spring diet of a population of Northern Pocket Gophers living in short-grass prairie habitat was 67% forbs, 30% grasses, and 3% shrubs. In a subalpine habitat, also in Colorado, diet was 87% forbs, 12% roots, and 1% grasses. Feeding activities of Northern Pocket Gophers are similar to those of other species of pocket gophers and are believed to have contributed to the formation of Mima mounds throughout much of the USA west of the Mississippi River. In Colorado, adult Northern Pocket Gophers usually occupy Mima Mounds, but juveniles occupy interrmound areas. In areas with heavy snowpack, individuals tunnel in the snow and deposit excess soil in the tunnels. When snow melts in spring, these rope-like tubes of soil settle to the ground, leaving evidence of the individual’s winter activities. As in other pocket gophers, the burrow system is a series of shallow feeding tunnels radiating spoke-like from a deeper, central network that contains one or more nest chambers and several smaller chambers for storage of food or fecal pellets. Surface feeding activity in the immediate vicinity of the borrow entrance has been reported for the Northern Pocket Gopher.			The Northern Pocket Gopher is active at any hour of the day, with periods of peak activity around dawn and dusk. In one study, radio-tracked individuals were active c.12 hours/day. Like all pocket gophers, Northern Pocket Gophers are prodigious diggers: one captive individual released in a vegetable garden with fairly compact soil was able to dig 50 cm of tunnel in 15 minutes, 32 m of tunnel in eight days, and 146 m of tunnel in six months. In montane habitats with denser soils, individuals burrowed at a nearly constant rate of 2 cm/minute. A study in Colorado showed that the Northern Pocket Gopher tends to dig around rocks larger than c.2:5 cm in diameter, but smaller rocks are removed with surrounding soil and deposited on the surface. The Northern Pocket Gopher does not hibernate and is active year-round.

The Smoky Pocket Gopher avoids areas with shallow or rocky soils and densely forested areas with little understory growth. It is known from elevations of 300 m to more than 3000 m.	There is no specific information available for this species, but all pocket gophers that have been studied to date eat predominately underground roots and tubers and a limited amount of surface vegetation. The Smoky Pocket Gopher readily invades cultivated fields and is considered an agricultural pest wherever it occurs in contact with humans. As in all other pocket gophers, the burrow system is a series of shallow feeding tunnels radiating spoke-like from a deeper, central network that contains one or more nest chambers and several smaller chambers for storage of food or fecal pellets.			There is no specific information available for this species, but the Smoky Pocket Gopher is probably active at any hour of the day, with periods of peak activity around dawn and dusk. It does not hibernate and is active year-round.	Alvarez-Castaneda, Castro-Arellano, Lacher & Vazquez (2008d), Ceballos (2014), Demastes et al. (2002), Fernandez et al. (2014), Hafner et al.

Northern Bottlenose Whales appear to favor areas with complex seabed topography and are most commonly recorded in canyons along shelf margins, around oceanic islands, or around seamounts. Northern Bottlenose Whales may be yearround residents in some locations. In others, there is evidence of large-scale seasonal movements. In particular, a large number of individuals seem to move into the Norwegian Sea in early spring and summer and move out again in late summer and early autumn. Its not known where these individuals go, but seasonal patterns of strandings around the Faroe Islands, UK, and the Republic of Ireland suggest that they may move through the Faroe-Shetland channel and into the Atlantic Frontier region to the west of the British Isles. During these movements, it is not uncommon for some individual Northern Bottlenose Whales to stray into shallower shelf waters, where they may remain for extended periods of time before either leaving or stranding.	Primary prey of the Northern Bottlenose Whale throughout most of its distribution is the squid Gonatusfabricii, but they consume a wide range ofspecies of deep-water squid, and deep-water fish are not uncommon in the diet in some locations. They primarily consume a very narrow range of prey sizes. Most prey is 0-5-6% of an individual whale’s total body length. Prey capture is almost certainly achieved through suction feeding.

Blainville’s Beaked Whale is the best known of the species of Mesoplodon and is particularly common around oceanic islands, although it may also occur in the open ocean. One study found that its occurrence was linked to upwelling of deep-water currents that likely increased density of prey in the area where they were found.	Blainville’s Beaked Whales consume deep-water squid and, to a lesser extent, deep-water fish. They forage at depths of 500-1500 m, usually at or close to the seabed. It appears that prey are pursued and consumed individually, and prey capture is by suction feeding.	Widely distributed in tropical and subtropical waters throughout the world.

Distribution of Sowerby’s Beaked Whaleis restricted to cooler waters, and most records come from waters cooler than 15°C.	Sowerby’s Beaked Whale is one of the few species of beaked whales that seems to primarily consume deep-water fish rather than deep-water squid. It is known to take a wide range of bentho-pelagic fish, including deep-water gadoids. Almost all of its prey is 1-6% of an individual’s total body length, with a clear mode at 2-3%. In common with other species of beaked whales, feeding likely occursat great depth, often over 500 m and possibly as deep as 3000 m or more. Foraging dives may be up to an hourin length.	Restricted to the cooler waters of the N Atlantic Ocean from 71° 30" N in the Norwegian Sea, Iceland, and [Labrador (Canada) in the N, to Madeira, Azores, and NE USA to the S; single records from the Gulf of Mexico and E Mediterranean Sea are thought to represent vagrant individuals.

Such grasslands, dominated by Narenga porphyrocoma, Saccharum spontaneum, S. bengalensis, Imperata cylindrica, and Themeda villosa, form characteristic associations 2-3 m in height. However, most such early successional communities are subject to wide-scale annual burning and accordingly are characterized by low diversity and the overwhelming preponderance of a few, fire-resistant grasses. Therefore they almost certainly constitute suboptimal habitats for Pygmy Hogs and most other grassland dependent species, which are deprived of cover and other resources for protracted periods prior to the early season rains. The species is not found in structurally similar grasslands located in riverine floodplains, which are subject to prolonged inundations during the monsoon. These grasslands are generally fertile alluvial areas, making them desirable for agriculture. Human use of these habitats contributes to the rapid decline of Pygmy Hogs throughout their known or presumed former range.	Pygmy Hogs feed on roots, tubers, shoots, and ground vegetation, along with worms and other invertebrates and, probably, small vertebrates (e.g. reptiles and the eggs and nestlings of ground-nesting birds).			The species seems to be most active during the day, although this remains poorly studied. A study of diurnal activity patterns in captive animals revealed that the highest proportion of observation time was dedicated to foraging and moving, followed by being inside the nest, resting, displaying, and allogrooming. The two sexes partitioned their time rather differently. Females seemed to spend more time on foraging than males, while males moved more than females, which was associated with elevated levels of display behavior and courtship performed by them. Display was exhibited only by males and performed during the breeding season. Allogrooming was the most prominent social interaction observed, with certain individuals grooming more than others. Moreover, among the breeding pairs, males groomed considerably more than females. It is possible that male Pygmy Hogs move a lot and display considerably to increase their potential reproductive success. Because these observations were on captive animals it is not clear how these time budgets would be changed under natural conditions, where the presence of predators and other factors would likely change their behavior.

It was recently reported to be common in montane and mossy forest 925-2150 m elevation in Balbalasang-Balbalan National Park, Kalinga Province , Luzon, and a recent birding trip report found many pig wallows in the park. In the Kitanglad Mountain Range on Mindanao, signs of pigs were also seen in montane, mossy forest between 1800 m and 2000 m . A specimen taken in 1996 was found at 1100 m , and in another in 1960 at c. 1300 m , but it is unclear whether the species still survives at these elevations today in Kitanglad. Habitat information from other areas is scarce, butit is assumed that the species is now largely restricted to higher forests in remoter areas.	Nothing is known specifically about what the species feeds on in high elevation forests, but presumably it survives on a diet of tubers, fallen fruit, and invertebrates.			Little is known of the species’ circadian activity in remoter areas, but it is reported to be essentially nocturnal in areas subject to human disturbance.	Cruzana et al.

Small numbers of these animals are also known to persist in some degraded habitats, such as Imperata cylindrica grasslands, as long as there are areas of dense cover, but there is evidence that some and perhaps most of these individuals are either feral domestic pigs or hybrids between S. cebifrons and free-ranging domestic pigs introduced by farmers in hinterland communities. In captivity, Visayan Warty Pigs readily bathe in open pools and use mud wallows, and it is assumed that the animals also do this in the wild state.	The Visayan Warty Pig is omnivorous, feeding on a range of plant and animal species. Because of the species’ scarcity in the wild there are no direct reports of feeding behavior, but some information has been obtained from scats and feeding signs. The species appears to feed on plant species such as Lithocarpus ( Fagaceae ), Platea excelsa (Icainaceae), and Dillenia reifferscheidia ( Dilleniaceae ), with the former two species possibly being completely dependent on S. cebifrons for the dispersal of their seeds. The species also appears to feed on a range of vines, palms, wild bananas, and agricultural crops such as taro and avocados, as well as earthworms. Captive animals will readily consume a wide variety of cereals, fruits, vegetables, leafy branches, and grass, and most individuals will avidly consume rodents (rats and mice) and other prey items.			Little has been reported about the activity patterns of S. cebifrons in undisturbed areas, because these areas are so remote and the terrain so rugged as to make even chance observations unlikely. In more accessible areas, where the species is heavily hunted, the animals avoid human activity (but may raid agricultural crops planted within or close to forest edges) and are mainly active at night.

In Europe, the species occurs in agricultural landscapes, as well as riverine and mountainous forests, where it reachesits highest densities in oak-dominated forests. In South-east Asia, S. scrofa is found in mature forests, secondary forests, gardens, and plantations. It can reach very high densities in dipterocarp forests during times of mastfruiting. S. scrofa can cause considerable damage to agriculturalfields. The animals generally avoid open fields but do enter them readily when crops are taller and thus provide cover.	S. scrofa is a typical omnivorous species. They eat almost anything they come across, including grass, nuts, berries, carrion, roots, tubers, refuse, insects, and small reptiles. They are also known to prey on young deer and lambs, and, in India , have been observed to prey on Chital (Axis axis) and to forcibly appropriate fresh kills from Leopards (Panthera pardus). Vertebrate prey may constitute an important part of the species’ diet in some areas, though studies in Spain revealed that prey items (mostly birds and crayfish) made up only 4% of their diets. Snails and terrestrial arthropods were frequently found but take up less volume. The species causes considerable damage to croplands, with damage to permanent grassland more frequent and more severe than damage to annual crops. S. scrofa is preyed on by a range of species, including Gray Wolves (Canis lupus), Dholes (Cuon alpinus), Tigers (FP. tigris), Leopards, Eurasian Lynxes (Lynx lynx) and some larger reptiles, such as crocodiles and pythons (Python spp.).			Activity of S. scrofa varies geographically but seems to be concentrated between dusk and dawn, and especially between 20:00 h and 24:00 h and around 05:00 h, with a primary resting period at night and a briefer rest during the early afternoon. In areas with high hunting pressure, a shift to nearly exclusive nocturnal activity has been observed. S. scrofa rests in tight groups with bodily contact. The resting places, used several times before being abandoned, are made of troughs lined with leaves and branches. Wallowing is a favorite activity. After wallowing, the Eurasian Wild Pig rubs against trees and bushes, an activity that serves as a territorial marker.	Acevedo et al. (2006), Albayrak & Inci (2007), Appelman (1931), Appolonio et al.

The reasons for this are not known, but it might be because the pigs are unable to tolerate low temperatures. They evidently prefer secondary or disturbed forests, though they are also often found near the coasts in remnant patches of mangrove and swamp forest. They are rare in the few remaining lowland primary forests and in areas with high human populations where otherwise suitable habitat is fragmented and surrounded by agricultural land. However, they do feed on crops, making nocturnal raids on fields of corn and cassava. As with S. scrofa , the species is widely persecuted for such depredations. The two species appear to avoid each other. In the 1920s, their abundance was thought to be similar, but only one species was generally found in a given location. S. scrofa appeared to be better adapted to agricultural areas and heavily degraded forests, and S. verrucosus more restricted to woodlands.	Ecological information about S. verrucosus is rare because when the species wasstill relatively common, extensive descriptions of feeding and breeding ecology did not differentiate between S. verrucosus and S. scrofa . One account from 1928 describes their ecological similarities: both species feed on a range of animal and plant foods, including fallen fruits, roots, worms, and insects. They are particularly partial to ripe rice, making them a feared agricultural pest.			There is little known about activity patterns of S. verrucosus. Interview surveys on Java in 2003 suggest that the species is mostly nocturnal, with several respondents reporting that damage to rice fields almost exclusively happened at night. It could be that a shift from generally diurnal activity patterns in pigs to nocturnal ones is because of the very high hunting pressure on the species.

It is found at elevations up to moss forest at about 2300 m , but it prefers valleys.	Little is known about the feeding behavior of S. celebensis . Roots, fallen fruit, leaves, and young shoots are thought to constitute the bulk of their diet, with invertebrates, small vertebrates, and carrion as occasional secondary additions. However, no quantitative data are available about percentages of these itemsin their diets, and how this varies over time and in different habitats. Unlike babirusas, S. celebensis has been observed to consume grasses, although this is based on brief observations only.			The Sulawesi Warty Pig is primarily diurnal. Most feeding activity observed in relatively undisturbed areas occurs during the daylight hours, concentrated in the early morning and late afternoon.	Alvard (2000), Bosma et al.

This tree family is often dominant in lowland and hill forests, and is characterized by synchronized flowering and mast-fruiting. Bearded Pigs also make extensive use of riverbanks, where they root among herbs and look for earthworms. Other habitats they use include estuarine swamps, secondary and all kinds of oldjungle, beaches, all kinds of plantations, clearings, and also the outskirts of towns. The species is well known forits migratory behavior. Bearded Pigs are scattered across large regions during non-mast fruiting times, but move from both mountain and swamp habitats to drier lowland forests when fruit becomes abundant.	Bearded Pigs are real omnivores and it has been said that “it is almost easier to state what they will not eat.” They feed on a long list of food plants, but also consume roots, fungi, invertebrates in soil and rotting wood, small vertebrates, turtle eggs, and carrion. Fruit supply is believed to have particular influence in determining growth rate, fat deposition, and reproduction. The other foods that normally occur in the forest are assumed to allow only slow growth at best. The oil-rich seeds of members of the tree families Fagaceae and Dipterocarpaceae are thought to be especially important. During mast fruiting the majority of seeds in the diet are dipterocarps, although they can and will eat other species. Oaks, especially Castinopsis spp., Lithocarpus spp. , and Quercus spp. , are also favorites. During fruiting times, they are almost solely seed predators, and Bearded Pigs play an important role in the distribution of seeds. They also consume a few figs (e.g. Ficus dubia), melastomes, and other tiny, hard testas, which can pass through their guts and germinate.			Bearded Pigs are mostly diurnal. They are subject to irregular migrations, seeming to follow fruit when in season so that one year a particular spot may swarm with them but not be troubled again for many years after. The ripening of illipe nuts ( Shorea sp. ) in Sarawak and East Kalimantan appears to be significantly correlated with pig migrations. These mass migrations of Bearded Pigs are distinct from annual local movements damaging rice fields. The somewhat forced, lemminglike aspects of these large scale pig migrations are exemplified by the observation of a pig whose hindquarters were paralyzed and which pulled itself forward byits front legs to follow its conspecifics. The appearance of large numbers of pigs traveling together is especially obvious during river crossings, which they do in groups of over 100 animals. This provides local hunters with the opportunity to kill large numbers of pigs for meat and fat, from which they extract oils. Mass river crossings might have evolved at a time when crocodiles were still abundant in the region. Bearded Pigs appear to exist in different population states, which have been summarized as follows. 1) Dispersed,static populations exploiting small, dispersed, unpredictable and discontinuous “background” food sources. Low breeding and growth rates possible. Local movements only. Example: typical mixed dipterocarp forest in Borneo between generalized fruiting episodes. 2) Small to medium populations exploiting concentrated, predictable and continuous “target” food sources. High breeding and growth rates possible. Local movement only. Example: Koompassia-Burseraceae forest in Peninsular Malaysia . 3) Small to medium populations, with members aggregating to exploit large, dispersed, unpredictable food sources. Breeding and birth rates depend on success of matching movements to fruiting within a dynamic mosaic of fruit production. Short to medium-range movements. Example: typical mixed dipterocarp forest in Borneo between generalized fruiting episodes. 4) Small to large populations moving regularly to exploit concentrated, predictable, and discontinuous target food sources. Breeding and growth linked to activity of food sources. Short-range to long-range movements. Size of population varies from year to year depending on background food supply. Examples: Dryobalanops aromatica association in Peninsular Malaysia ; Dinochloa association in Sabah . 5) Large and expanding population exploiting an exceptional supply of background food available over a period sufficient for severallitters to be raised to sexual maturity. High breeding and growth rates characteristic. Long range movements. Example: interior of Sarawak in 1954, 1959, 1983 and 1987. 6) Very large and collapsing population having exceeded background food supply. Low breeding and high death rates. Increasingly desperate long-range movements. Example: starving herds reported from Malaya and Borneo. It remains largely unstudied how these different population states have been affected by the continuing loss, degradation, and fragmentation of forest habitats. Unconfirmed information from local people in Kalimantan and Sarawak suggests that mass migrations of pigs no longer occur to the same extent as reported formerly, even as recently as the 1980s and early 1990s, which might indicate that with the removal of millions of hectares of high timber value dipterocarp forests food dynamics and related population states have been severely disrupted.

It also frequents drier limestone and mangrove forests in coastal areas and occurs in cultivated and managed areas.	Although this has not been studied,it is thought that ecologically S. ahoenobarbus is similar to the Bearded Pig from Borneo, which consumes roots, fungi, invertebrates, small vertebrates, and a great range of plants, especially favoring lipidrich fruit of the Fagaceae and Dipterocarpaceae families.			Little is known, except that the species is most often seen or reported to be active in the early mornings and late afternoons in relatively undisturbed areas, but tends to be almost exclusively nocturnal in areas where hunting and other anthropogenic disturbances are commonplace.

Generally they are confined to various types of savanna grasslands, open bushlands, and woodlands, usually within range of perennial surface water. Although usually absent from forests, thickets, cool montane grasslands, deserts, and steppes, Common Warthogs are present in aridlands near the Danakil desert and Bale Mountain forests ( Ethiopia ) and in Djibouti forests. Abundance of Common Warthogs is probably linked to the availability of Aardvark (Orycteropus afer) holes, as the warthogs need deep burrows for protection from predators as well as from fluctuations in temperature and humidity. Their bodies can obviously sustain a certain tolerance range, and they cope with high temperature by sheltering in shade, wallowing, and dust-bathing. Piglets are particularly vulnerable to cold and malnutrition during drought, which, together with predation and other factors, account for an over 50% mortality rate during the first year.	Common Warthogs have an omnivorous diet composed of grasses, roots, fruits, bark, fungi, eggs, and carrion, as well as small mammals, reptiles, and birds. The diet varies with seasonal availability of food items, although the species is very selective. Areas with abundant food resources like bulbs, rhizomes, and nutritious roots can sustain large temporary congregations of animals. This opportunism and dietary versatility account for the Common Warthog’s successful survival strategy. They are powerful diggers, using both snout and hooves, but not tusks. When feeding, they often walk on their anterior knuckles with their hindquarters raised. They use their incisors to wrench grass stems or strip seedheads, and they excavate rhizomes and mineral-rich earth with the hard edge of their snout.			Common Warthogs are highly diurnal. They go underground before dark and sleep in abandoned burrows of Aardvarks or other animals. Males enterlast and commonly reverse in, with the head facing the opening, ready to fight an intruder or rush out as needed. To a certain extent, season and weather dictate their daytime activity, which includes a range of typical occupations like feeding, drinking, wallowing, rubbing against trees or termite mounds, and grooming. Feeding occurs mainly in early morning and late afternoon, but they also graze between irregular resting periods in the shade of bushy thickets or in mud wallows. Humans, Lions (Panthera leo), Leopards (P. pardus), crocodiles, and hyenas are the main predators, but Cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) and African Wild Dogs (Lycaon pictus) are also capable of catching small warthogs. Females are extremely aggressive and courageous when defending their piglets. It has been reported that Common Warthogs have inflicted deep and deadly wounds in Lions. Common Warthogs have been observed allowing Banded Mongooses (Mungos mungo) and ground hornbills (Bucorvus spp.) to groom them to remove ticks.	Child et al.

The natural vegetation on the Togian Islands consists of wet forests of variable types, frequently differing from one island to another, and ranging from monsoon to evergreen. B. togeanensis has also been sighted in mixed gardens, regrowing scrub on former slash-and-burn cultivation fields, secondary forest, village edges, freshwater swamps, and beaches. On Malenge and Kadidiri Islands, the species is most frequently seen moving through coconut plantations.	B. togeanensis reportedly feeds on rhizomes, fallen fruits (Pangium edule, Dracontomelon sp., Mangiferasp., Artocarpus sp., Spondias dulcis) and also tamarinds and cacao, as well as annual herbs and vegetables. The species is also reported to feed on coconut, but it is unclear whether it eats the shoots of young trees or the fallen fruits.			During interview surveys on the Togian Islands, most respondents (68:2%) reported encountering B. togeanensis in the morning, between 06:00 h and 10:00 h. The reported observations of the species included various activities during that time, such as foraging, mating, wallowing, and resting.	Akbar et al.

No surveys have been done on the habitat use of babirusas on Buru Island, but the local Rana people report that babirusas are most often found in rocky habitat in hilly areas and mountains.	[Local people on Buru report that babirusas primarily feed on leaves, roots, and fruits in the forest, but never enter people’s gardens to feed on crops, unlike the other pig species on Buru, which causes considerable damage to crops. The species is also said to feed along the shoreline when the tide is out.			On Buru, B. babyrussa is mostly seen during the morning and late afternoons, but rarely around midday.

Whereas previously the animal had been reported to occur in low-lying areas near coasts, recent anecdotal and survey reports indicate that the species is now confined mostly to the interior, on higher and less accessible ground. Although often associated with swamp and riverine areas, there is still insufficient data to be conclusive on the aquatic affinities of the species. The species frequently uses mineral salt licks.	Diet and feeding behavior in B. celebensis remain poorly studied in the wild, but observations on captive animals provide a useful picture of their potential diet. The anatomical structure of the stomach and digestive tract suggest that B. celebensis is omnivorous. In zoos, adults ofthis species have been observed to chase, catch, and eat small mammals and birds, implying that they may show similar behavior in the wild. Observations of both wild and captive individuals suggest that the species consumes a wide variety ofleaf , root, and fruit material, with fruit especially important. Their jaws and teeth are strong enough to crack very hard nuts with ease. Not unlike the Bornean Bearded Pig ( Sus b. barbatus ), the apparent requirement of B. celebensis for fruit-bearing trees as a component ofits environment has been implied, because as soon as mature trees were cleared by forestry operations or conversion to food crop production, the babirusas were no longer to be found in the area. Whether this is a result of changes in food resources or increased hunting pressure and disturbance from logging crews has not yet been clarified. B. celebensis forages for food items on the ground, under logs and stones, in wet areas, and on bushes and trees. Animals will stand with their forelimbs against tree trunks to reach hanging leaves and fruit, and will even balance on their hindlimbs to pluck leaves from the trees.			Based on observations of captive animals, B. celebensis appears to be mostly diurnal. These animals slept at night, which is consistent with the general lack of activity at night recorded in North Sulawesi . About an hour before sunrise at 06:00 h, individuals began to wake up and move about. Voiding of fecal material and urine occurs at this time, and the animals appeared to prefer to defecate under branches and fallen tree trunks. Foraging extended throughout the day, but occupied a larger proportion of the time in the morning. From about mid-morning onwards an increasing proportion of the time was taken up with non-foraging activities. The animals were either wallowing or lying down. Both in the wild and in captivity, males have been observed to wallow more often than females.	Andreescu & Murariu (1993), Bosma & de Haan (1981), Bowles (1986), Bowles et al.

In transition zones, they frequently visit dry forests, savanna woodlands, and cultivated areas. The speciesis highly adaptable and locally benefits from regeneration of logged-over forested areas, where they find more varied food sources and a reduction of their natural predators. Population densities are 1-6 ind/km?, but wide variations are recorded. Up to 18-4 ind/km?* have been recorded in the forest-savanna ecotone of Lopé National Park, Gabon . The species is widespread in its habitat except where the Forest Hog ( Hylochoerus meinertzhagent) is common.	Red River Hogs have an omnivorous diet, with a marked preference for roots and tubers. They also feed on grasses, aquatic plants, bulbs,fruit, carrion, and various small animals. They use their snouts to root in the ground and can do serious damage to crops. The species uses the noises and calls of monkeys and frugivorous birds to detect potential food supplies. Seasonal aggregations of Red River Hogs at masting fruit trees account for observations of temporary groups of up to 60 individuals. In Makokou ( Gabon ), these groups are very noisy when breaking hard nutshells of Caula edulis and Irvingia gabonensis, which attracts the attention of predators and secondary feeders. The hogs are sometimes followed by guinea fowl, who peck about the turned over ground for food. Seasonal massive availability of preferred foods and the hogs’ high level of opportunism explain semi-nomadic circuits of movements.			These animals are most active in the evening and during the night, and rest in burrows deep within dense thickets during the day. They are capable of covering long distances in search of food, and like to rest in wallows in shallow swamps. The whole sounder runs away when alarmed or frightened. If striped piglets are present, they crouch and freeze while adults face the danger. When cornered or wounded, the adult hogs can display considerable courage and vigorously attack predators, including humans. They are very good swimmers and are frequently seen crossing large rivers. Their main predators are humans and Leopards (Panthera pardus), but locally also Lions (P. leo), Spotted Hyenas (Crocuta crocuta), and pythons.

Within areas of co-occurrence (like the Albertine Rift), the Bushpig lives at higher elevations and the Red River Hog in lowland forests. Elsewhere, the two species are separated by ecological barriers such as the Congo River. Bushpigs occur in a wide range of forested and woodland habitats, from sea level to montane forest (up to 4000 m on Mount Kilimanjaro), with a marked preference for valley bottoms with soft soils and dense vegetation. There are striking differences in habitat among subspecies, with, for example, the hassama race primarily occurring in upland forest areas and the somaliensis race favoring riverine forests.	This species is omnivorous and highly adaptable. It is probably a major seed disperser. Bushpigs consume roots, tubers, bulbs, corn, fungi,fruit, eggs, invertebrates, birds, small mammals, and carrion. In Uganda , Bushpigs were seen following groups of monkeys as they forage and feeding on discarded fruits. They make extensive use of their snouts to root for larvae, worms, and underground plant parts. Locally, Bushpig rooting can leave large areas plowed up and cleared of standing vegetation. In cultivated areas, sounders can do serious damage to crops in a short time.			Bushpigs are predominantly nocturnal, resting under heavy thickets of vegetation during the day. Nests for raising young or during rainy seasons are built in the cooler parts of their range. In the southern Cape , South Africa , they tend to be more diurnal during the colder months, suggesting that temperature regulation is a significant factor influencing the rhythm of activity. Mud wallowing and rubbing against trees are also regular activities. Population density is regulated by a wide range of predators including humans, Lions (Panthera leo), Leopards (P. pardus), Spotted Hyenas (Crocuta crocuta), pythons, and eagles. Courageous and dangerous when cornered, both boars and sows defend piglets cooperatively and aggressively. Fighting behavior includes frontal and lateral postures with dorsal crest erected, snout-boxing, and forehead shoving. Bushpigs run fast and swim easily. Their senses of smell and hearing are very good, but eyesight only fair.	de Beaux (1924), Cooper & Melton (1988), Duckworth (1992), Estes (1991), Ghiglieri et al.

Forest Hogs inhabit a variety offorest types: subalpine areas and bamboo groves, forest—grassland mosaics, montane, lowland, and swamp forests, river galleries, wooded savannas, and thickets. It is an ecotonic species, preferring intermediate habitat zones where the edge effect is maximized and where resources from different vegetation types can be exploited within a limited area. It shows a preference for a convenient and permanent water source, thick understory cover in some parts of its home range, and a diversity of vegetation types. In dense forest areas, Forest Hogs tend to concentrate in isolated hilly, rocky habitats of savanna and forest, around clearings, or in mixed forest patches rather than in monodominant forest. The variety of forest habitats occupied implies a high degree of adaptability to local climatic conditions. Forest Hogslive in cold uplands (where night temperatures may fall to 0°C) as well as hot lowlands, but do not tolerate low humidity or prolonged solar radiation.	Forest Hogs are mainly grass-eaters and folivorous. Feeding habits show that they are neither exclusively forest animals nor pure grazers. They display great versatility in food selection, depending on the seasonal content, stage of growth, and quantity of plant resources available. Many species of grasses, sedges, and herbs are cropped. They root much less than other wild pigs and dig only in soft or muddy soils. In a savanna area of the Queen Elizabeth National Park, Uganda , they select more than 100 food plants. In Virunga National Park, however, five major savanna species were selected, on average, over the course of a year; the hogs preferred some grasses during dry seasons and others during rainy seasons, selecting grasses when their nutrient and energetic content is highest. Young piglets are known to feed on grasses well before weaning. In dense forest, both Forest Hogs and Bongos (Tragelaphus eurycerus) use mast seed areas in monodominant stands. Examination of adult hog dung reveals different types of material, including poorly masticated grass seeds, stems, and leaves, fragments of millipedes and shields of ticks, earth nodules, and bristles. They also excavate salty earth with their tusks and lower incisors. These salt licks may be termite mounds, shallow caves, dry river banks, or even the embankment of a deserted road. Occasionally Forest Hogs eat meat and bones ofcarrion, eggs, and larvae. Coprophagy is not common, but piglets are fond of fresh elephant dung.			In the grassland-bushland—dry forest mosaic ofVirunga National Park, DR Congo , Forest Hogs spend on average 25% oftheir daily time moving and foraging in savanna, 21% moving, foraging, and wallowing in thickets or forested areas, and 54% resting in a sheltered sleeping site. Activity is most intense in the early morning and late afternoon, with a rest during hottest hours. There is no evidence of true nocturnal activity. Wallowing is a favorite activity, taking up about one hour each day in certain areas. Before sundown, family groupsretire to their sleeping place under dense thickets. Along the trails, the same dung heaps are always used as communal latrines. Males are fierce defenders of their group and sometimes lead the sounders in driving off predators and competitors. When shot at, they will attack humans. Competition between males is violent and may last for half an hour. Males rush at each other from a distance, crashing their foreheads together like rams. Despite their reinforced skulls, deaths among males due to fractures are not uncommon, but most wounds heal. This species is quite vocal, producing a minimum of ten recognizable categories of sounds. The main predators on adults are Leopards (Panthera pardus) and Lions (P. leo). Spotted Hyenas (Crocuta crocuta),, pythons, and eagles prey on young hogs and their mortality rate is about 50%.

The distribution of the northern population lies within two vegetation types, “Somalia-Masai Acacia-Commuphora deciduous bushland and thicket” and “Somalia-Masai semi-desert grassland and shrubland.” These habitats range from xerophylous bush and open woodland to subdesert steppe. Desert Warthogs prefer plains on predominantly sandy soils, and avoid hilly terrain. Most records are from lowland areas below 200 m , a few are at higher elevations, but none are above 1000 m . The species is dependent on the availability of water and shade and occupies regions with rainfall of 100-600 mm per year. Areas with higher rainfall are avoided,as are the driest and hottest desert regions with rainfall less than 100 mm per year. Desert Warthogs are not present in the hot coastal zone of Somalia , the eastern tip of Ogaden, and most of the subdesert shrubland east of Lake Turkana . The harsh climatic conditions associated with this vegetation type suggest that the species could,in fact, be totally absent from a vast desert area between Lake Turkana and the Lorian Swamps in north-eastern Kenya . The Desert Warthog, albeit more specialized for extremely arid environments than the Common Warthog, is not a true desert animal.	With its peculiar incisor-less morphology and other cranial features, the Desert Warthog is the most specialized living suid. Its diet is not known, and nothing is known ofits feeding habits and physiology. As the incisors are functionally absent, the lips and gumsare used to detach or pick up food items. The rootless third molars suggest an adaptation toward an abrasive diet.			Little is known. The species seems most active during the day, even during the hottest hours. Family sounders spend the night in burrows. In the valleys of south Somalia , they raid crops seasonally and consequently are persecuted.	Culverwell et al.

The Brush Rabbit is confined to brushy habitat, as its common name implies.	Brush Rabbits feed mainly on grasses, and diets vary according to season and region. In September, they feed on spike rush ( Eleocharis palustris , Cyperaceae ) and grasses ( Poaceae ) such as creeping eragrostis ( Eragrostis hypnoides), foxtail grass ( Hordeum murinum), soft chess grass ( Bromus hordeaceus), and oats ( Avena fatua). Summer diets include wild roses ( Rosa californica, Rosaceae ), Mexican tea ( Chenopodium ambrosioides, Amaranthaceae ), and several plants in the daisy family such as sow thistle ( Sonchus asper), bull thistle ( Cirsium lanceolatum), and Baccharis douglasii; rush ( Juncus sp. , Juncaceae ); and berries ( Rubus sp. , Rosaceae ). In autumn, roots of poison hemlock ( Conium maculatum), stems and leaves of blackberry (R. vitifolia), and berries ( Rubus sp. ) also are eaten. In winter, green clover ( Trifolium involucratum, Fabaceae ) is most preferred, along with new available green grass. Brush Rabbits rarely feed in the open on the mainland, but they prefer to feed in the open and rarely underbrush on Ano Nuevo Island. Before venturing into the open to feed, individuals remain for a while just inside dense brushy cover. After entering an open area next to brushy cover, individuals remain motionless for some time, apparently watching for signs of danger. Several individuals might simultaneously feed in the same area. They rise up on their hindfeet to feed on newly grown tips of plants.			Brush Rabbits are basically crepuscular, being most active between sunset and 02:00 h and again from ¢.06:00 h to 10:30 h. Some reports suggest that most activity occurs in the morning. Individuals are least active between 11:00 h and 16:00 h. They spend considerable time sunning, usually in the mornings or afternoons. After feeding, Brush Rabbits return to a form for grooming and basking in the sun. They might climb trees for resting.

The Pygmy Rabbit often occurs in the same habitat as the Black-tailed Jackrabbit ( Lepus californicus ) and the White-tailed Jackrabbit (L. townsendir). A high degree of vegetation cover appears to be a major habitat feature selected by the Pygmy Rabbit. Densities of big sagebrush in areas used by the Pygmy Rabbit exceed those found throughout most of the plant’s distribution. Usually, heavy grazing increases density of big sagebrush. After grazing ceases and grass cover has recovered, habitat becomes optimal for Pygmy Rabbits. This suggests that they are opportunistic, inhabiting disturbed sites in the sagebrush landscape that have an increased density of sagebrush. Intense feeding activity by Pygmy Rabbits near their burrows might sustain or even increase density of sagebrush. Pygmy Rabbits extensively use burrows that they mainly construct by themselves, so soil structure is thought to be another key habitat feature. Soft deep soils are required for burrowing. Burrows typically have 4-5 entrances but up to ten or only two have been recorded. Entrances are located at bases of sagebrush. Burrows are usually found on slopes and are oriented in a north-to-east direction. Entrance diameters are 10-12 cm. Tunnels widen below the surface, form chambers, and extend to a maximum depth of c.1 m. Pygmy Rabbits also use holes among volcanic rocks, in stone walls, around abandoned buildings, and those made by American Badgers (7axidea taxus) and Yellow-bellied Marmots (Marmola flaviventris). Dense stands of big sagebrush growing adjacent to streams, along fences, and in borrow ditches along roads might be used by dispersing Pygmy Rabbits.	Preferred diet of the Pygmy Rabbit is big sagebrush (A. tridentata); individuals sometimes even climb into tops of larger plants to feed. Big sagebrush consists up to 99% of the Pygmy Rabbit's food intake in winter. Grasses ( Agropyron spp. and Poa spp. , both Poaceae ) are more important, with 30-40% ofdiets in midto late summer. A study investigating characteristics of browsed vs. unbrowsed big sagebrush showed that higher crude protein increased chances that plants would be browsed by Pygmy Rabbits, and the opposite was the case for certain plant secondary metabolites.

Shrub layer is up to 2:5 m tall, with heavy cover of a zacaton grass and herb layer. Volcano Rabbits temporarily colonize cultivated fields of oats ( Avena sativa, Poaceae ) when plants are half-grown in late July until they are harvested in early October. They use burrows with hidden entrances at bases of grass clumps. They probably do not actively dig their own burrows; it has been reported that they use abandoned burrows of the American Badger (Taxidea taxus), the Rock Squirrel (Otospermophilus variegatus), the Nine-banded Armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), and Merriam’s Pocket Gopher (Cratogeomys merriam).

Rock crevices and boulders are essential components of habitat ofJameson’s Red Rock Hares. Populations sometimeslive on isolated kopjes up to 22 km apart, and therefore, individuals have to cross non-rocky habitat to disperse. When Jameson’s Red Rock Hare lives in sympatry with the Hewitt’s Red Rock Hare ( P. saundersiae ), it prefers drier, lower mountain slopes, with manyjumbled boulders and rock crevices, and Hewitt’s Red Rock Hare prefers higher elevations with fewer boulders and crevices and higher rainfall.	Jameson’s Red Rock Hare is herbivorous and grazes on grasses among rocks or at the base of rocky hills. Individuals congregate on recently burned areas to feed on sprouting grasses and avoid areas of dense aerial cover and moribund vegetation when feeding.			Jameson’s Red Rock Hare is mainly nocturnal but regularly feeds and sunbathes in late afternoon. It rests in rock crevices, under boulders, or in thick grass near rocks during the day.

Amami Rabbits are also found in clear cuttings and forest edges covered by the Japanese pampas grass Miscanthus sinensis ( Poaceae ). The most suitable habitat seems to be a mosaic of the following different habitat types: rich undergrowth cover to provide abundant food, short arboreal cover of young secondary forests to provide hiding places, and old forests to yield acorns in autumn. The Amami Rabbit occurs from sea level up to 694 m on Amami Oshima and 645 m on Tokunoshima.	Diet of the Amami Rabbit consists of more than 29 species of plants: twelve species of herbaceous plants (e.g. Adenostemma lavenia, Asteraceae ; Carex , Cyperaceae ; M. sinensis and Peucedanum japonicum, Apiaceae ; and Mosla dianthera, 1.amiaceae) and 17 shrub species (e.g. Castanopsis sieboldii, Fagaceae ; Melastoma candidum, Melastomataceae ; Rubus sieboldii, Rosaceae ; Styraxjaponicus, Styracaceae ; and Zanthoxylum ailanthoides, Rutaceae ). The Amami Rabbit eats mainly sprouts and young parts of plants but also nuts from many plant species. Nuts of C. sieboldii are the main part of the diet in autumn and winter.

The single most important factor limiting distribution of the Marsh Rabbit is availability of water. It usually inhabits areas of brackish water, although it can occur in freshwater marshes. In Florida, Marsh Rabbits live in habitats with trees such as magnolia ( Magnolia grandi-Jlora, Magnoliaceae ), tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica, Cornaceae ), and sweet gum ( Liquidambar styraciflua, Altingiaceae ) and shrubs such as blackberry ( Rubus betulifolius) and dewberry (R. continentalis), both Rosaceae . They also occur in habitats dominated by cattails ( Typha sp. , Typhaceae ) that grow along edges of ponds. They have also been recorded in grassy fields, mangroves, hummocks, fallow tomato fields, and vegetation along canals, ditches, roadsides, and cultivated fields. The Marsh Rabbit does not live in burrows; it digs holes with long toenails. Holes are sloped at ¢.60° and ¢.30 cm deep. The US endangered subspecies Lower Keys Marsh Rabbit is usually found in saltmarsh/ buttonwood transition zones and freshwater marshes. Their forms have been found in patches of saltmarsh or buttonwoods in brackish wetlands, or in patches of hardwoods embedded in or adjacent to marshes in freshwater wetlands.	Diet of Marsh Rabbits includes various aquatic plants; herbaceous material from shrubs, trees, and woody plants; cultivated crops; and grasses, sedges, and flowers.			Marsh Rabbits are mainly nocturnal. They are most active between 19:00 h and 04:00 h. They rest in forms during the day.

In the northern part of their distribution, Swamp Rabbits inhabit mature forests, fiveyear-old regenerating forest tracts, and canebrake ( Arundinaria gigantea, Poaceae ) communities at about the 24°C isotherm. They are never far from water. Forms and runways are found in tangled marsh vegetation and brier bushes. Holes in the ground or in trees but also stumps, logs, low crotches oftrees, tangles, cane patches, and open grassy places are common form sites . Elevated objects such as logs are used as defecation sites, and these latrines probably serve as territorial markers. Hence, elevated objects are important habitat requirements. The nominotypical subspecies aquaticus is associated with mature forests, but littoralis is associated with coastal and riparian areas.	The Swamp Rabbit feeds on a variety of plants. One study reported that plants eaten in order of preference were crossvine ( Bignonia capreolata, Bignoniaceae ), sedges ( Cyperaceae ), poison ivy ( Rhus radicans, Anacardiaceae ), grasses ( Poaceae ), catbriers ( Smilax sp. , Smilacaceae ), and tree seedlings. Another study showed that plants were eaten according to their relative availability and were mainly sedges ( Carex lupulina) but also blackberry ( Rubus sp. , Rosaceae ), hazelnut ( Corylus sp. , Betulaceae ), deciduous holly (Zlex deciduas, Aquifoliaceae ), and spicebush ( Lindera benzoin, Lauraceae ).			Onset of evening activity of Swamp Rabbits is delayed as sunset becomes progressively later in spring. Delay is greatest for females and lower ranking males. Time and onset of evening activity are variable but occur well before sunset in late spring and summer. In late winter and early spring, onset of evening activity occurs during twilight.

They prefer rocky, brushy, and wooded areas. In California, they occur at elevations of 1372 m to at least 3542 m. Mountain Cottontails use burrows and forms but do not dig their own burrows. They mostly live aboveground in dense habitat, but frequently use crevices in rocks or burrows as shelter in less dense vegetation.	In California, the diet of the Mountain Cottontail consists mainly of sagebrush, but they prefer to feed on grasses when available in spring and summer. Western juniper ( Juniperus occidentalis, Cupressaceae ) also is eaten. They usually feed underbrush cover or in clearings near shelter.			The Mountain Cottontails actively feeds in early morning and evening. In California, activity started at dawn until 09:30 h and again from 14:30 h until dark, but in Nevada individuals were active from 17:45 h until dark. Activity of Mountain Cottontails peaks 1-2 hours after sunrise and 0-1 hour before sunset in Oregon. Adult males become extremely secretive after the reproductive season, but activity of females is relatively constant throughout the years.

Historically, New England Cottontails occupied early successional forests that became abundant when farmlands were abandoned, and maturation of these forests into closed-canopy stands caused the decline of this species beginning in the 1960s. New England Cottontails prefers habitats with dense understory vegetation and fallow agricultural lands. They avoid venturing into the open and remain in close proximity to cover.

The Desert Cottontail lives from below sea level in Death Valley, California, up to elevations of at least 1829 m. It is often associated with riparian zones in arid regions. In California,its hides are found in heavy brush and willows along rivers. In pine-juniper woodlands, shrubs are its primary cover. Plant species associated with the Desert Cottontail are willows ( Salix sp. , Salicaceae ), buttonwillow ( Cephalanthus occidentalis, Rubiaceae ), wild grape ( Vitis californica, Vitaceae ), greasewood ( Adenostoma fasciculatum, Rosaceae ) in California and arrow-weed ( Pluchea sericea, Asteraceae ), screw-bean mesquite ( Prosopis pubescens) and catclaw ( Acacia greggii), both Fabaceae , in southern Nevada. Occasionally, the Desert Cottontail is found where there is little or no vegetation cover. Abundance of Desert Cottontails is highest under moderate cattle grazing. It relies on thick brambles for cover rather than using holes. The Desert Cottontail in south-eastern Arizona typically builds forms in areas with triangle-leaf bursage ( Ambrosia deltoidea, Asteraceae ) and tall plants (higher than 1-5 m). Desert Cottontails have some physiological adaptations that enable them survive in desert environments. A shift upward of the thermoneutral zone occurs from winter to summer, and basal metabolism decreases by 18% during the same period. Body temperature is 38-3°C when ambient temperatures are below 30°C, whereas body temperature equals ambient temperature of 41-9°C in summer.	Diet of Desert Cottontails depends on seasonal availabilities of plants. Food plants include various unidentified grasses; foxtail grass ( Hordeum murinum, Poaceae ); galingale ( Cyperus sp. ) and sedge ( Carex sp. ), both Cyperaceae ; rush ( Juncus sp. , Juncaceae ); willow ( Salix sp. , Salicaceae ); valley oak ( Quercus lobata, Fagaceae ); miner's lettuce ( Montia perfoliata, Montiaceae ); blackberry ( Rubus vitifolius) and California wild rose ( Rosa californica), both Rosaceae ; hoarhound ( Marrubium vulgare, Lamiaceae ); and Baccharis douglasii and California mugwort ( Artemisia vulgaris), both Asteraceae . True grasses ( Poaceae ) such as Johnson grass ( Holcus halepensis), Bermuda grass ( Cynodon dactylon), blue grass ( Poa pratensis), ripgut grass ( Bromus rigidus), and wheat grass ( Agropyron caninum), as well as morning glory ( Convolvulus sp. , Convolvulaceae ), bull mallow ( Malva borealis, Malvaceae ), honeysuckle ( Lonicera sp. , Caprifoliaceae ), and sow thistle ( Sonchus asper, Asteraceae ) were important dietary items of Desert Cottontails in the Sacramento Valley, California. Desert Cottontails living in fields fed almost entirely on grasses. Cultivated hollyhock, carrots, acorns of valley oak, and fruits of almond and peach also are eaten. Type of cover is an important factor to determine feeding sites. Most feeding in late morning and early evening takes place in areas of brushy cover adjacent to open grassland. Important factors that affect daily feeding periods are habitat, season of the year, fog, rain, and wind. Maximum numbers of Desert Cottontails were observed feeding at dawn. Wind appears to interfere greatly with normal feeding. Light intensity determines distance from shelter an individual will venture for food. Desert Cottontails traveled up to 100 m from cover after dark. They feed by taking successive mouthfuls in open situations. Subsequently, heads are elevated, and they start to chew. They extend their bodies along the ground when feeding on low-growing grasses. Necks are stretched out, and front feet edge forward. Hindfeet are brought forward with hops when food can no longer be reached. Generally, terminal parts of plants are eaten.			The Desert Cottontail is most active in early morning and evening and has activity peaks at 05:00-07:00 h and 18:00-20:00 h. They are inactive at temperatures above 27°C. Individuals seek shelter from rain and high winds. The Desert Cottontail use burrows during most of their daily periods of inactivity in open habitat. They hide by sitting in forms that are small cleared places on the ground. Desert Cottontails are more vigilant in late morning and early evening than at dawn or dusk. In California, they remained hidden in thickets during winter days, but they moved about at any time in late spring.	AMCELA, Romero & Rangel (2008a), Angermann (2016), Arias-Del Razo et al.

These grasslands originate in the succession between primary colonizing grasses through deciduousriverine forest to the sal ( Shorea robusta, Dipterocarpaceae ) forest climax. Tall grassland habitats might also have an understory during later stages of succession. Maintenance of tall grassland habitat is caused by prolonged inundation during the monsoon or by periodic burning in relatively undisturbed areas, or by regular burning, grazing, or regular harvesting in disturbed areas. Tall grassland habitat has different plant species, dominating in different situations. Main types of grassland are composed of Themeda villosa, Saccharum-Narenga associations, Arundo-Phragmates associations, Imperata cylindrica, and Cymbopogon spp. (all Poaceae ) and Alpinia allughas ( Zingiberaceae ), Typha elephantine ( Typhaceae ), and Leea crispa ( Vitaceae ). The Hispid Hare inhabits all of these and other plant communities of varying importance at different times of the year according to availability of cover. During the dry season when most of these communities are subject to extensive regular burning, the Hispid Hare is deprived of cover and all other resources until regrowth of vegetation following onset of early rains a few weeks or even up to 2-3 months later. During this period, the Hispid Hare is entirely dependent on any unburned cover such as marshy sward dominated by Phragmites , Arundo spp. , and Saccharum spontaneum (all Poaceae ) along riverbanks that are maintained by later prolonged inundation and are therefore left unburned. It has been suggested that carrying capacities of Hispid Hares are determined by sizes of small patches of tall grassland that escape annual dry-season burning. Enforced confinement within these isolated patches of post-burn cover might increase susceptibility of Hispid Hares to predation.	Based on fecal analysis, Hispid Hares in Nepal ate 19-23 plant species, with S. spontaneum, I. cylindrica, Desmostachya bipinnata, and Cynodon dactylon (all Poaceae ) having the highest frequency of occurrence in feces. Composition of plant species in the diet was proportional to availabilities. A significantly higher diversity of plants was recorded in the diet of Hispid Hares after the fire. Another study reported that Hispid Hares ate inner parts of stems of Narenga porphyrocoma, leaves of Cymbopogon sp. , I. cylindrical, and inner cores of S. spontaneum.

South American subspecies inhabit arid and semiarid regions mostly in dry upland habitats. Habitat of the Eastern Cottontail has been improved by interspersion of old fields and briar thickets, creation of edge, establishment of open feeding areas, and breaking up large continuous areas of monotypic habitat. Forms used during inactivity are chosen to provide cover and shelter and consist of brush piles and herbaceous and shrubby vegetation. Dens can be used to escape.	Diet of the Eastern Cottontail includes a wide variety of plant species. Herbaceous plants are eaten during growing seasons, and woody plants are eaten during dormant seasons. Herbaceous plants might also be eaten throughout the year except when covered by snow. Two pronounced feeding periods have been reported: 3—4 h after sunrise and from sunset to one hour after sunset. Feeding habits of Eastern Cottontails vary seasonally and with successional changes of plant communities.			The Eastern Cottontail is most active at dawn and dusk, with increased activity on moonlit nights. Activity was greatest during summer when nights were shortest and when air temperature ranged from —18°C to 1°C. Rain apparently reduced activity.	Allen, D.L.

Black-tailed Jackrabbits favor heavily grazed areas, or where grasses are not abundant and cacti and low shrubs are scattered. They inhabit open habitats with mesquite ( Prosopis ), sagebrush ( Artemisia ), desert scrub, and open pine ( Pinus )—juniper ( Juniperus ) in Arizona. They avoid areas of tall grass or forest where visibility is obscured. Where Black-tailed Jackrabbits and Antelope Jackrabbits ( L. alleni ) live in sympatry, they are often seen togethersitting under the same bush or running away side by side. Antelope Jackrabbits are more numerous on grassy plains at high elevations, and Black-tailed Jackrabbits are more numerous in mesquite along valley bottoms and in barren chaparral desert.	Diet of the Black-tailed Jackrabbit varies among locations and seasons, but grasses and sedges are primarily eaten in summer. In Utah,it ate nearly all plant species available, including sagebrush ( Artemisia tridentata, Asteraceae ) and shadscale ( Atriplex confertifolia), Nuttall’s saltbush (A. nuttalliz), winterfat (Ewrotia lanata), and saltlover ( Halogeton glomeratus) all Amaranthaceae . The Black-tailed Jackrabbit also eats fungi, gravel, or sand, and it has been reported to feed on horse carcasses in Texas and Tamaulipas. During winter or in desert areas, the main food is dry and woody plant parts such as broom snakeweed ( Gutierrezia sarothrae, Asteraceae ) and creosote bush ( Larrea tridentate, Zygophyllaceae ). There is no evidence that the Blacktailed Jackrabbit drinks free water. In dry habitats, succulent plants and cacti are increasingly eaten as drought conditions increase. Shade seeking reduces heat load and need for water. Other factors that contribute to reducing water loss are insulation and reflectivity of pelage. The Black-tailed Jackrabbit can damage agricultural crops. In Kansas (USA), most crop damage was restricted to fields near resting areas, and buffer fields reduced damage. While feeding, Black-tailed Jackrabbits move slowly and are constantly alert for sings of danger. They rely on hearing more than on other sense to detect danger. Black-tailed Jackrabbits rear up on their hindfeet to browse on bushes.			The Black-tailed Jackrabbit is primarily nocturnal, with activity peaks at 04:00-07:00 h and 18:00-20:00 h. Feeding periods vary greatly with weather, season, and moon phase. Wind is the most important weather factor limiting activity. Calm and dry evenings are more favorable for longer feeding periods than windy and wet evenings. Falling snow and fog limit nocturnal activities, but rain and temperature have little effect on movement. The Black-tailed Jackrabbit often builds forms to protect itself from heat during the day by making excavations in sand under vegetation. In the Mojave Desert, USA, the Black-tailed Jackrabbit retreats to burrows during hot summer days but only for 3-5 hours in the afternoon. Self-constructed burrows begin as forms and gradually are deepened by digging during hot afternoons. After several days, burrows are deep enough to enclose an individual. Some Black-tailed Jackrabbits also use holes dug by prairie dogs (Cynomys) or American Badgers (Taxidea taxus). Burrows are not used during high winds or cold weather, even though they are typically available.	AMCELA, Romero & Rangel (2008g), Angermann (2016), Arias-Del Razo et al.

The Cape Hare is extremely adaptable and lives in many environments. It prefers open-toclosed habitats and avoids bushy habitats. Pastures overgrazed by domestic stock are particularly favored. Cape Hares move into burned areas as soon as grasses begin to sprout. Distribution of the Cape Hare has increased with bush clearing and extensive savanna fires. On the Arabian Peninsula, the Cape Hare prefers shrubs rather than grasses for shelter in summer. In the Namib Desert, it makes short burrows to avoid exposure to the sun.	Cape Hares are herbivorous and graze on grasses at night. Diets presumably vary according to habitat. Fecal analysis in Kenya revealed that 19% ofthe diet was dicotyledons, 40% grasses, 1% sedge, and 32% stem fibers. Grasses in the diet included Sporobolus sp. , Aristida sp. , Chloris sp. , Cynodon dactylon, Enneapogon sp. , and Eragrostis sp (all Poaceae ). The study found differences in proportions of grass species eaten at different sites, but seasonal differences, including wet and dry seasons, were small at each site. The Cape Hare is reasonably opportunistic, selecting different grass species according to their availabilities. It is expanding its distribution at the expense of less adaptable species of Lepus because it thrives on overgrazed pastures.			Cape Hares are nocturnal.

Mountain Hares prefer to live in forests of pine, birch, and juniper. In Scotland and Ireland, heather moors and bog land are favored, and in Russia, copses in the middle of open steppe and reed belts around lakes are selected. In the Alps, Mountain Hares prefer highly structured forests and thickets at forest edges. In spring, abundant herbaceous food in meadows is important to Mountain Hares. When a habitat offers food and shelter against predators, Mountain Hares use it for rest and activity. Forms are usually a depression they make. In snow, Mountain Hares burrow to make forms and enter rock crevices or marmot (Marmota) burrows for shelter or escape. They sometimes dig permanent burrows 1-2 m long in the ground. Mountain Hares in Ireland and the Alps do not burrow, but in Russia, complex burrows up to 7 m long have been reported. On agricultural land, Mountain Hares tends to be replaced by European Hares ( L. europaeus ) in Europe and Cape Hares ( L. capensis ) further east.	Mountain Hares are grazers in summer and browsers in winter. Their diets vary with habitat. Plant species used as food in forest habitats include leaves and twigs of Salix and Populus (both Salicaceae ), Sorbus ( Rosaceae ), Betula ( Betulaceae ), Juniperus ( Cupressaceae ), and Vaccinium ( Ericaceae ); on Scottish moorlands and Swedish islands, Calluna ( Ericaceae ) is eaten. Different grass species and clovers are eaten when available. With snow cover, Mountain Hares feed on twigs, bark, moss, and lichens. They seldom drink water but may eat snow. Re-ingestion ofsoft pellets takes place at 09:00-16:00 h and increases dietary digestibility up to 25%; these pellets contain three times as much protein as regular pellets. Mountain Hares feed with their back to the wind and can clear snow from vegetation with their forepaws. When snow is hard, they move to lower ground to feed.			Mountain Hares are nocturnal throughout the year, with a prolonged resting phase during the day. Activity patterns change seasonally with circadian rhythms. Mountains Hares rest by day in a form, with ears back and eyes half closed, but they only sleep for a few minutes at a time. In summer when daylight increases and in winter when food is scarce, more Mountain Hares are active during the day. Activity is highest during the first two hours after sunset.

Tundra of coastal regions of Alaska from sea level to elevations over 600 m. The Alaskan Hare occurs almost completely outside the limit of spruce ( Picea , Pinaceae ) forests. It lives in dense alder ( Alnus , Butalaceae) thickets.

Northern populations of Alaskan Hares primarily live in tundra or alluvial plains, and southern populations primarily live in coastal lowlands. Diet of the Alaskan Hare in April/May consists mainly of shrubs. Woody parts of the Alaskan willow (S. alaxensis) and leaves of crowberry are most commonly eaten. In spring, they fed at edges of melting snow patches where crowberries from the previous summer were abundant. One captive Alaskan Hare seldom drank water. Breeding. Mating season of the Alaskan Hare occurs in mid-April and May, and gestation is ¢.46 days. Parturition occurs in late May and early June and seems to coincide with loss of snow cover in late May. Females have one litter per year, with 5-7 young (average 6-3 young). Precocial young are born in a nest aboveground in thick shelter of willow or alder. Nests are mere depressions in the vegetation and have no lining. Young have brownish buff upper parts and white under parts. Nose, eye rings, and feet are buff. Ear tips are black, and tail is white. Female Alaskan Hares nurse 5-9 weeks—a prolonged nursing period probably enhances survival of young and perpetuates rapid growth. A few weeks after birth, young begin to drift away from their mother. Rapid growth allows young to reach minimum adult body mass during the short summer; young are fully grown by late September. Initial rate of growth of the Alaskan Hare is greater than that of the Snowshoe Hare ( L. americanus ), the Black-tailed Jackrabbit ( L. californicus ), and the White-tailed Jackrabbit (L. townsendi). Activity patterns. Alaskan Hares leave dense thickets in the evening to feed. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Alaskan Hares live alone, except during mating when groups of 20 or more are observed. If they still have their winter pelage in May, they remain near snowfields at high elevations. One captive Alaska Hare never attempted to seek shelter during snow and rain.			Alaskan Hares leave dense thickets in the evening to feed.

The Artic Hare prefers hillsides or rock-strewn plateaus rather than flat bog land. Throughout most ofits distribution, it spends summer in the tundra north of the tree limit, but in winter, it might penetrate up to 160 km into the forest. Areas with little snow cover and wind exposure are favored, and groups of several hundred Arctic Hares may aggregate in such areas in winter, moving from one place to the other in search for food.	The Arctic Hare feeds mainly on woody plants throughout the year. Arctic willow ( Salix arctica, Salicaceae ) is the main species eaten in all seasons, and its leaves, buds, bark, and roots make up to 95% of winter diets. It also feeds on mosses, lichens, buds, and berries of crowberry ( Empetrum niger, Ericaceae ), young blooms of saxifrage ( Saxifraga oppositifolia, Saxifragaceae ), mountain sorrel ( Oxyria digyna, Polygonaceae ), and various kinds of grasses. Summer diets of Arctic Hares are highly variable but mainly contain Arctic willow, mountain avens ( Dryas integrifolia, Rosaceae ), and grasses. On Baffin Island, dwarf willows (S. arctica and S. herbacea) and crowberry are the main food. In Greenland, diets consist of Arctic willow and mountain sorrel. The Arctic Hare regularly feeds on stomach contents of eviscerated Caribou (Rangifer tarandus). Water is obtained by eating snow. It makes trails from one grazing place to the next. Often high places are selected to forage. Arctic Hares dig through snow to find food. If snow has a hard crust, they stamp on it with their forefeet to make a hole. Feeding usually occurs in morning and evening.			The Arctic Hare rests during the day when the sun is shining, but during the dark winter, it has no fixed time for resting. When resting,it usually sits near a large stone, dozing or asleep, sheltered from wind, covered from aerial predators, and warmed by the sun. Usually, it chooses a site a little way up a slope. Arctic Hares often are immobile during resting,sitting crouched, with ears halfway erect and eyes nearly closed. Often 2—4 individuals rest together. In the afternoon, the Arctic Hare often leaves its resting place and starts feeding.	Angermann (1967a, 2016), Aniskowicz et al. (1990), Audubon (2005), Bakeret al.

Distribution of the White-tailed Jackrabbit extends into the badlands of South Dakota and montane pastures among scattered evergreens in Colorado. White-tailed Jackrabbits use shallow forms at bases of bushes or besides rocks. In winter, they use cavities connected by tunnels dug c.l m into snow or use shrubs and trees for cover. When White-tailed Jackrabbits and Black-tailed Jackrabbits ( L. californicus ) are sympatric, they use different habitats. White-tailed Jackrabbits occur in open flats and fields of ryegrass ( Lolium , Poaceae ) in Oregon and bunchgrass and rabbitbrush in Washington; Black-tailed Jackrabbits inhabit predominantly sagebrush ( Artemisia , Asteraceae ). In California, the White-tailed Jackrabbit was recorded more often on higher slopes and ridges, and the Black-tailed Jackrabbit more frequently on valley floors.	The White-tailed Jackrabbit feeds primarily on succulent grasses and forbs. Shrubs are eaten in winter after grasses and forbs have become dry. When feeding on shrubs, woody stems are favored over leaves. Diet selection is influenced by age of White-tailed Jackrabbits, season, and availabilities of plant species. Abundant plant species in diets ofthis species are alfalfa ( Medicago sativa, Fabaceae ), creambush ( Holodiscus discolor, Rosaceae ), sagebrush, clover ( Trifolium sp. , Fabaceae ), common dandelion ( Taraxacum officinale, Asteraceae ), dryland sedge ( Carex obtusata, Cyperaceae ), Indian paintbrush ( Castilleja integra, Orobanchaceae ), goosefoot ( Chenopodium sp. ), and winterfat (Ewrotia lanata), both Amaranthaceae . One study in Colorado recorded 67 plant species in stomachs of White-tailed Jackrabbits. Pregnant or lactating females usually feed alone; males feed in groups of 2-5 individuals. After feeding, White-tailed Jackrabbits groom their heads and ears with their forepaws and lick their bodies. When sympatric, the White-tailed Jackrabbit seems to be a more selective feeder than the Black-tailed Jackrabbit and therefore has a competitive disadvantage.			White-tailed Jackrabbits are nocturnal and forage mainly between sunset and sunrise. A study in summer revealed that they start feeding at 15:00-16:00 h, peak activity was at 22:00-01:00 h, and most activity stopped by 03:00-04:00 h. They hide in forms during the day.

Densities of Corsican Hares vary due to competition with introduced European Hares that are habitat generalists; e.g. populations of Corsican Hares on the Italian mainland are now restricted to mountainous areas and lowlands and hills where densities of European Hares are low. In Sicily where European Hares are absent, Corsican Hares occur in a variety of natural and artificial lowland habitats such as open grassland, bushy pastures, and cultivated areas. Corsican Hares inhabit Mediterranean maquis (shrubland)—the mosaic of clearings, bushy areas, broadleaved woods, and coastal dunes.	Diet of the Corsican Hare in Sicily varies with seasonal availability of vegetation. Corsican Hares can eat 70 species of plants during the year, including monocotyledons and species of Cyperaceae and Juncaceae throughout the year, species of Poaceae in spring, and species of Lamiaceae in summer.

High densities of European Hares are reached on arable land. In Chile, Argentina , Australia, and New Zealand, where no other species of Lepus occurs, European Hares also inhabits pampas, sand dunes, marshes, and alpine fellfield (slopes). Many surveys have investigated habitat preferences of European Hares. In all studies,fallow land is preferred consistently, and residential areas are avoided. There is a positive association with abundance and habitat diversity.	European Hares feed predominantly on cultivated crops, weeds, and grasses. A study investigating dietary preferences showed that they positively selected forbs and grasses. Furthermore, chemical analysis revealed that they select food for high-energy content (crude fat and crude protein) and avoid crude fiber. During feeding, dominance hierarchies among individuals have been demonstrated.			European Hares are mostly nocturnal. In winter, activity starts with regularity shortly after sunset and ends shortly before sunrise. In summer, activity is less consistently tied to the dark period so that active European Hares can be regularly observed in full daylight. With GPS telemetry, it was possible to gain new knowledge on daily activity patterns of European Hares during summer. If sunset was early and sunrise late, evening and morning activity peaks occurred during the dark phase. This was the case in late spring and early autumn when nights are longer. When sunset was late and sunrise was early, activity peaked in full daylight.	Angermann (1972, 1983, 2016), Averianov et al.

The population of the Iberian Hare in Mallorca occurs in dry cropland and thickets. One study shows that habitat requirements of the Iberian Hare have changed significantly in recent decades from a highly significant association with natural vegetation in the 1960s to one with cultivated lands in the 1990s. This shift in habitat use might have enabled increases in numbers of Iberian Hares because anthropogenic habitats provide year-round cover and food. The Iberian Hare showed a high preference for uncultivated land for resting areas.	Diet of the Iberian Hare includes a wide variety of plant species. It feeds mostly on grasses, making up an annual average of ¢.70% of the diet in a mountain ecosystem. Ninety-one percent of available grass species were consumed, but only three of them were used in proportions greater than 5% ( Anthoxanthum odoratum, Secale cereale, and Agrostis spp. ). Diets consist of 81% grass in winter but only 55% in summer. Other plant groups such as herbs, shrubs, and plant inflorescences are eaten In summer.

In Arizona, Antelope Jackrabbits favored habitats on slopes at moderate elevations where grasses, mesquites ( Prosopis ), and catclaws ( Acacia ), both Fabaceae , are abundant. They also live in desert habitat with little grass, hilly country among scattered oaks ( Quercus , Fagaceae ) and junipers ( Juniperus , Cupressaceae ), and stabilized sand dunes. In Mexico, Antelope Jackrabbits occur in low and open grasslands, open grassy foothill with patches of low bushes, and arid and desert plains. Shelter forms include backing up under clumps of vegetation, a sitting place beside a cactus or mesquite trunk with no shade and no digging or scratching having been made, or a dug out depression in the soil. Antelope Jackrabbits always seek shade in shelter forms during hot seasons. Where the Antelope Jackrabbit and the Black-tailed Jackrabbit ( L. californicus ) occur sympatrically, they often sit together under the same bush or runaway side by side. The Antelope Jackrabbit is more numerous on grassy plains at high elevations; the Black-tailed Jackrabbit is more numerous in mesquite along valley bottoms and on barren chaparral desert.	The Antelope Jackrabbit feeds primarily on green grass (45%), mesquite ( Prosopis juliflora, 36%), and succulent cacti (7-8%). Of all cacti species available to it, it forages most on pulps and pods of Opuntia engelmanni ( Cactaceae ). Diet varies with alternating dry and rainy seasons: cacti are increasingly consumed during dry seasons, and grasses are favored after the rainy seasons. The Antelope Jackrabbit seeks minerals by digging and biting soil. There is no evidence that the Antelope Jackrabbit requires free water. Insulation and reflectance of pelage reduce water loss. Seeking shade reduces heat load and waterloss.			The Antelope Jackrabbit is nocturnal and crepuscular, but diurnal activity is commonly recorded. Shelter forms are used for resting during the day.

Human-made structures used as roosts were an old fort, old underground quarry, and underground water channels (“aﬂaj”); use of natural caves has been documented only three times. Echolocation consists of multiharrnonic QCF calls where pulse is composed of long CF component, combined with short FM component at end (CF-FM); terminating FM component is steep sweep of 1-3 kHz.

The Orange Diamond-faced Bat seems to be more limited by availability of roosts than vegetative cover type, although dry open habitats represent much larger part of overall distribution than humid and closed forests. Geographically isolated population in Pilbara inhabits the most arid zone in overall distribution.	The Orange Diamond-faced Bat is an aerial hawker and preys on ﬂying insects of various sizes, mainly smaller moths and beetles. Diet composition shows opportunistic prey selection; during wet season, it clearly prefers ﬂying tennites that provide fat-rich diets for pregnant and laetating females. Annually, diet averages 70% moths, 17% beetles, 7% termites (but in December, 056%), 5% ﬂies, and mosquitoes, with occasional ants, wasps, mantises, lacewings, bugs, and cockroaches (representing 1 —2% together). Individuals forage along gorges, ravines, and larger watercourses and in open woodlands and over grassland hills.	Endemic to Australia , in two di¶ unct regions separated by Great Sandy Desert: W region is smallcst and comprises the W part of Pilbara region of Westem Australia , and E region largest and includes NE Western Australia (Kimberley region), N Northern Territory , and NW Queensland .	https://zenodo.org/record/6611822/files/figure.png	The Orange Diamond-faced Bat is unable to enter torpor and does not hibernate or estivate; remains active year-round and forages in all seasons. lt is strong and highly acrobatic ﬂier; it ﬂies rapidly (up to 26 km h) with fast wingbeats, tends to forage with an erratic ziglagging ﬂight pattem, and remains in ﬂight all the time while foraging. 1 t forages at various heights: low to the ground or water surface at c.0 -1 m, up to the height above tree crowns, and in all stories in between, including understories and tree canopies. When leaving the day roost, ﬂight is most enatic, which is considered anti-predator behavior. It roosts in underground spaces in natural caves, man-made mines, and occasionally buildings. might roost in tree hollows, but this has not been conﬁrmed. Because the Orange Diamond-faced Bat cannot enter torpor, it needs to roost in relatively wann and humid spaces (28-32 C and 85-100% relative humidity) that naturally occur in deep caves or mines. Underground spaces with such conditions are relatively uncommon in most rocky landscapes of north-westem Australia , but in the monsoonal nonh, humid conditions probably allow use of more caves and rarely buildings. Orange Diamond-faced Bats are often seen ﬂying along roads at night. They leave day roost 10-20 minutes after sunset and forage for several hours (mostly 1 -5-4 hours) or the entire night; however, most individuals return to roosts c.2 hours before sunrise. Sometimes, there is a second activity period of 1-2 hours before sunrise. When roosting, they hang freely from the cave ceiling or on cave walls and are separated from each other by 10-15 cm. Echolocation consists of multihannonic QCF calls where pulse is composed of long CF component, complemented at start and end by two short FM components (FM-CF-FM). The CF component of the ﬁrst hannonic lasts c. 5-8 milliseconds, initial FM component is short upward sweep (not always detectable), and tenninating FM component is steep sweep of c. 20 kHz. Geographical variation in peak frequencies of calls was reported: 109-119 kHz (mean 114 -6 kHz) in northern Australia and 116-126 kHz (mean 121 kHz) in the Pilbara region.

Trouessart`s Trident Bats most frequently occupy dry deciduous forest limestone karst; however, they are found in numerous other dry vegetation fonnations on limestone karst (dry open palm savanna and spiny bush), dry vegetation on sand (original, transitional, disturbed, and degraded dry deciduous forests and original and disturbed spiny bush), and other local types of forests (e.g. gallery forests).	Considering its diet composition, Trouessart`s Trident Bat is most probably an aerial hawker, preying on ﬂying insects of various sizes among vegetation. lndividuals were documented foraging in various forest habitats, most frequently in riparian forests and forest interiors and only occasionally at forest edges or forest clearings. Generally, dietary spectrum is narrow, with moths reportedly the most frequent prey item. Besides moths (on average 58-7%), beetles (21 -4%), bugs (7-5 %), cockroaches (4-2%), and ﬂies (1 -7%) were also present in feces. Diets varied between seasons: dry season diets had c.64% moths, 12% beetles, 6% bugs, 1 % cockroaches, and 1 % ﬂies, and wet season diets had c.22%, 52% beetles, 7% bugs, 13% cockroaches, and % ﬂies.

Percival's Trident Bat roosts in underground spaces in natural caves and human-made structures (e.g. mine tunnels and dam body corridors). lt roosts in small and narrow crevices and were once found in a cavity on the ground that was thought to be a porcupine den. Echolocation consists of multiharmonic QCF calls where pulse is composed of short CF component, combined with short FM component at end (CF-FM); tenninating FM component is steep sweep up to 29 kHz. Call is unique due to its unusually high peak frequency of ﬁrst harmonic, well above 200 kHz; however, fundamental frequency often used during foraging. Call has mean durations of 1 -9 milliseconds (fundamental frequency) and 4 -6 milliseconds (ﬁrst harmonic). Peak frequencies (fundamental frequencies) are 101-6-105 -3 kHz (mean 103 -4 kHz), ﬁrst hannonics are 204-212 kHz (mean 207 -8 kHz). highest frequency is 212 kHz, and end (lowest) frequency is 183 kHz. Slight sexual dimorphism was detected in CF component of fundamental harmonic frequency: females ha\e, on average, lower frequency (102-9 kHz) than males (103-7 kHz). Extremely high frequency of echolocation calls is speculated to be an adaptation to more efficiently catch moths.

During the peak of the dry season (July/August) the depth of the river is dramatically reduced, exposing extensive sandbanks. The Tocantins River, however, is embanked, with relatively clear water, several rapids and a faster current. Botos occurin all habitats in this river, but highest densities occur (both during the seasons of low and falling water) in confluences and bays.	Very little information is available for this species, but accounts of fishermen and observations of Araguaian Botos stealing fish from hooks and nets and pursuing schools of fish in an apparently cooperative way confirm the piscivorous diet of the species, similar to that of the two other species of botos. One study reported three species of fish seen in the mouths of Araguaian Botos: Hydrolycus armatus (Characiformes), and Pimelodus blochii and Oxydoras niger (both Siluriformes) of estimated size of 80 cm, 40 cm, and 60 cm respectively.

Similar to other botos, it aggregates at confluences and meetings of waters and is present in most of the aquatic habitats ofthe region. Otherwise, the habitat of the Bolivian Boto is quite similar to the other species of botos in the Amazon.	There is no specific information available for this species, but examination of stomach contents of two Bolivian Botos suggests a catholic piscivorous diet, similar to that of the Amazon River Dolphin.	Bolivian lowlands (NE to the Chiquitano Mts and SW to the piedmont elevations in the subandean region) and SW Brazilian Amazon in the upper Madeira River, and the Beni, Ichilo, Marmoré, Ipurupuru, Iboré, Baré, Abuna, and Iténez (= Guaporé) rivers and their tributaries, all of which drain into the Madeira; recently also recorded below Santo Antonio falls between the cities of Porto Velho and Borba.	https://zenodo.org/record/6599258/files/figure.png	There is no information available for this species, but it probably moves seasonally due to fish migration and the annual flooding cycle.

Botos can swim in water shallower than 2 m and come very close to the shore c.1 m depth. Most Amazon River Dolphins live in areas of low gradient, where annual cycles of water depth produce profound habitat changes. For half the year, Amazon River Dolphins have access to vast areas of inundated floodplain, much of it consisting of a complex mosaic of forest, lakes, and channels. This habitat is characterized by low current and high fish density, providing a safe environment, especially for young individuals. Occupied rivers, lakes, and channels vary substantially in character. Some have acidic, black water emanating from flooded forests. Others have clear water originating in geologically old drainage basins. Many have white water laden with sediments from the Andes. Fish communities vary among these ecosystems, but Amazon River Dolphins feed on a wide variety of fish species. Seasonal changes in precipitation and water depth dominate habitats of botos. Major rivers and channels retain adequate water for Amazon River Dolphins throughout the year, but many of the smaller channels and lakes cannot be relied on to retain water in the dry season, so botos and most fish abandon them for several months of the year. The flexible body and broad, rotatable flippers of Amazon River Dolphins, together with the lack of a “normal” falcate dorsal fin, are adaptations for swimming in the tangled vegetation of the flooded forest.	The heterodont (more than one type of tooth) dentition of all three species of botos, unique in cetaceans, allows them to capture and crush armored prey such as armored catfish, crabs, and, on occasion, turtles. Fish dominates the diet of all botos. More than 50 fish species, representing more than 20 families, have been found in the stomachs of Amazon River Dolphins in the Central Amazon area, Brazil, including freshwater fish of benthic, littoral, and pelagic habits. Fish of 5-80 cm in length (average c.20 cm) are consumed. Prey diversity is greater at high water levels when botos have access to flooded forests.	Most of the Orinoco and Amazon basins in Venezuela, Colombia, Brazil, Peru, and Ecuador.	https://zenodo.org/record/6599256/files/figure.png	There is limited evidence of diurnal activity patterns of Amazon River Dolphins from echolocation click density and movements, but presence or absence of light is arguably unlikely to be of profound importance because botos live in waters where visibility and light penetration are usually very low. Indeed,vision is not essential to their well-being, and a substantial number of healthy botos have opaque eye lenses (cataracts).	Aliaga-Rossel et al.

The elevational range ofthe Aye-aye is from near sea level up to 1875 m.	Diet of the Aye-aye varies by locality and season. It consists mainly ofinsects and their wood-boring larvae, along with hard-shelled fruits, seeds, tree sap, bamboo shoots and pith, flowers, nuts, nectar, honey (obtained by the destruction of active hives), fungus, and eggs. Presence ofthe Aye-aye in some areas appears to be determined by one ofits primary food sources, seeds of “ramy” ( Canarium madagascariense, Burseraceae ). Other dietary staples include seeds of Orania trispatha ( Arecaceae ) and Terminalia catappa ( Combretaceae ); beetle and moth larvae embedded in trees, bamboo, and seeds of Terminalia fruit; cankerous growths on Intsia bijuga ( Fabaceae ); nectar from traveler's palm ( Ravenala madagascariensis , Strelitziaceae ); and crops such as coconuts, lychees, sugar cane, and mangos. Crop damage by Aye-ayes can be considerable; in one case, they destroyed 80-100% ofthe coconut crop in two villages. Aye-ayes spend most oftheir active hours foraging for insect larvae. Using their oversized, highly sensitive ears, they intently listen for sounds oftheir quarry tunneling within the wood and simultaneously tap the surface of the bark with their fingers to trace hollow pathways. When a grub is located, the Aye-aye usesits long front teeth to gouge a hole in the wood and then extracts the grub with its wiry middle finger. The same basic technique is used to get at the insides of coconuts and eggs and even while drinking, using the finger to draw water to the mouth. This movement of the third finger from the food or water to the mouth can be extraordinarily rapid; it has been measured at a rate of3-3 strokes/second. They are extremely noisy eaters. Captive individuals have been known to hide coconuts.			Nocturnal and mainly arboreal. Aye-ayes sleep generally rolled up into a ball with the tail wrapped over the body, during the day in tree forks, vine tangles, or their large bowl-shaped nests. They emerge from the nest as early as 30 minutes before sunset and may not return to until after sunrise. Males become active earlier than females. Over the course of the night, more than 50% of an Aye-aye’s timeis spent moving, interspersed with bouts of feeding, grooming, and resting. When they rest, they remain sedentary but are fully aware of their surroundings and not asleep. These rest periods can last for as long as two hours. Individuals groom themselves several times during the night in bouts lasting up to 30 minutes—the longer the session, the higher in the canopy they perch, presumably for safety. The long, narrow third finger is used for combing, scratching, and cleaning the fur; the other fingers are flexed during these behaviors.	Albignac (1987), Ancrenaz et al.

Most active digging follows rains that reduce soil hardness and thus energetic costs involved in expanding the burrow system. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Naked Mole-rats are highly social. Within a colony, there is a size-based dominance hierarchy, with larger individuals gaining preferential access to contested resources through shoving matches. Colonies range throughout a burrow system, which may be 0-5-3 km in length. They are strictly territorial and gradually shift from maintenance activities to digging, foraging, and burrow defense over the course of theirlives.

In the Alps, the West European Hedgehog occurs up to elevations of 2000 m but does not live above tree line. It generally does not enter extensive coniferous forests because oflack of ground cover. It is common in parks, gardens, and golf courses, and it seems to favor edge habitats between open and more densely vegetated areas. Rocky outcrops and piles of rocks can serve as shelters. Populations in cultivated areas are small or lacking where removal of hedgerows and use ofpesticides have reduced cover and amounts ofinvertebrate prey. It may move ontoirrigatedfields in dry years.	The West European Hedgehog is omnivorous but primarily eats invertebrates such as beetles, larvae, slugs, worms, andspiders. It also eats fruits, fungi, and small vertebrates including frogs, snakes, lizards, young birds, eggs, mice, and carrion. It has been reported to congregate around gardens and vineyards to feed on snakes. It commonly eats millipedes and carabid beetles, which use distasteful and noxious substances in defense. Some other distasteful species such as woodlice, staphylinid beetles, and some ladybird beetles seem to be avoided. It enjoys bread and milk, pet food, and kitchen scraps offered by humans. When foraging, it generally progresses slowly and pauses briefly to sniff the air or ground. It also will forage in a more rapid andlinear style whereit covers much more ground but still searches for suitable prey. The West European Hedgehog always is alert and constantly sniffing and listening. Prey likely are detected mainly by their odor, but sound also is important in finding prey. Prey items usually are snapped up rapidly, anditems buried in litter, grass, or soil are quickly rooted out. Males tend to travel faster than females while foraging, and both sexes travel fastest in short grass and progressively slower as density of cover increases.	W Europe, from British Is and Iberian Peninsula E to Fennoscandia and N & C European Russia, also on Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily, and many smaller islands. Introduced into New Zealand during second halfofthe 19" century and recently into Azores.	https://zenodo.org/record/6639342/files/figure.png	The West European Hedgehog is predominantly nocturnal, resting by day under piles of brush or in leaf nests in rocky crevices and burrows. Activity during midday often indicates that an individual is sick, but healthy individuals can be active during the day, particularly in autumn. Some lactating females can be almost as active during day as at night during summer, some individuals tend to emerge before sunset, and some retire to their nest well after dawn. Usual gait is slow, meandering walk that frequently is punctuated by short bursts of speed up to 50-120 m/minute. Males usually move at an average speed of 3-7 m/minute, females at 2:2 m/minute, and subadults at 2:2 m/minute. The West European Hedgehog lives on the surface ofthe ground without extensively burrowing or climbing. It is a good climber, and spines, besides serving as protection from predators, act as a cushion when it falls or drops from a height. It is a good swimmer but might not be able to escape from steepsided garden pools. It hibernates from about October to early April in colder parts ofits distribution, but individuals become active, emerge, and move to another nest 2-3 times in winter. Hibernation bouts last 5-27 days (average nine days). Some nests are repaired and re-used, and others are abandoned. Nests may be occupied, then abandoned for up to four months, and later re-occupied. Others are empty at first and occupied later, suggesting there are spare nests.

The Southern White-breasted Hedgehog is less common in treeless moors, uplands, and marshlands because it usually gathers broad, dry leaves to construct nests in burrows and other shelters that are used for hibernation. It prospers in wooded parks, gardens, golf courses, and farmlands; however, populations in farmlands are small or lacking where hedgerows have been removed and where use of pesticides has reduced populations of invertebrate prey. During dry years, it might move onto irrigated fields. In Turkey, it inhabits apple, pear, and mulberry orchards; agricultural fields of beets, spinach, corn, cabbage, and other vegetables; areas with thick grasses around barns and bushes; and urban areas.	The Southern White-breasted Hedgehog mainly eats insects and other invertebrates but also frogs, snakes,lizards, young birds, mice, some plant matter, fungi, and carrion.

In the Middle Atlas Range of Morocco, the North African Hedgehog occurs up to elevations of ¢.2000 m. It reportedly does not inhabit arid deserts, but it has been documented at oases in the Sahara Desert up to 500 km south of coastal Algeria. It seems to do well in areas inhabited by humans such as fallow or cultivated fields, palm groves, almond and olive plantations, hedges, woodlands, and suburban gardens. In Spain, it occupied open grass-scrub areas and used fields when available, butit avoided forests and urban areas.	The North African Hedgehog is primarily insectivorous and opportunistic. Diet includes fungi, worms, eggs,fruits, snails, insects, other invertebrates, small vertebrates, and carrion. In Algeria, diet included c.85% insects (mostly ants and beetles), 6% centipedes and millipedes, 5% spiders, 2% gastropods, and 1% crustaceans (isopods). On the Balearic Islands, diet contained snails, centipedes, insects, some small vertebrates (snakes, lizards, and frogs), and a truffle-like fungus. On the Canary Islands,it ate berries, corn, and pumpkins. Results of laboratory studies revealed that color of eggs did not influence rates of consumption of eggs, but size of eggs was important. North African Hedgehogs preferred to consume smaller eggs (quail) more than intermediate-sized eggs (partridge), and large eggs (chicken) were not consumed at all.			North African Hedgehogs are nocturnal. In Algeria, males were first observed dead on roads in spring from March onward. During this time, more males (45%) than females (31%) were found dead. High level of activity of males in spring (maximum in May) and summer coincides with breeding. Most juveniles were found dead on roads in late summer and early autumn (24%), corresponding to dispersal and foraging in preparation for winter. In late autumn,activity begins to decrease and becomes more reduced in winter, apparently to save energy during cold weather. In winter, North African Hedgehogs probably reduce their metabolism and hibernate. Day-resting sites are spherical structures that can be constructed offoliage, herbaceous vegetation, and human-made waste (e.g. plastic strings from nearby crops). These dayresting sites can be under dense vegetation on margins of cultivated crops and in giant canes, open-vegetated areas, buildings (farm sheds, retaining walls, or houses), and piles of logs or wooden boxes.

The Four-toed Hedgehog lives in areas with dry soils and is absent from deserts, marshes, and dense forests. It seems to be drawn to relatively open, dry, or seasonal habitats, with sparse or patchy grasses, especially overgrazed areas with dense populations of ungulates where there is an abundance of trampled herbage and dung to support termites and other insects.	The Four-toed Hedgehog is omnivorous. It will eat fungi and plant material such as fallen fruits, roots, and groundnuts, but it primarily preys upon invertebrates, especially termites, beetles, earthworms, millipedes, ants, grasshoppers, slugs, snails, and crabs. It also eats small vertebrates including snakes, lizards, frogs, and young and eggs of ground-nesting birds. It usually forages alone and hunts mainly by scent. It will dig for prey in soft, loose soils. Hearing and sight also are involved with searching for food. Immobile foods are toyed with before being ingested, and mobile prey is snapped up and chewed noisily. Lizards and mice are seized and shaken to death. Snakes are approached with caution and are bitten severely and repeatedly while the Four-toed Hedgehog protects its face with spines to avoid being struck;it will continue the attack until it has broken the spine or eviscerated the snake. It readily consumes carrion and will scavenge road kills at night.

In captivity, two peaks of activity are evident: 21:00-24:00 h and ¢.03:00 h. It rests by day curled up in a ball or reclined full-length under rocks, logs, or matted grass or in leaflitter, termitarium, rocky crevice, or hole in the ground. Such refuges change daily unless they are being used to rear young or as a hibernation site. During warm rainy season when food is abundant, the Four-toed Hedgehog gains weight and enters torpor when weather is cool and dry. In southern Africa, hibernation takes place in June-September, with individuals remaining torpid for up to six weeks and emerging during warm intervals. In some parts ofits distribution,it probably does not hibernate. The Four-toed Hedgehog can climb and swim; it typically moves slowly butis capable of bursts of speed.

The Southern African Hedgehog requires adequate cover of dense grasses or shrubs. It is absent from deserts, marshes, and dense forests.	The Southern African Hedgehog is omnivorous and forages in litter and just under the soil surface. Its vision might be poor, and it seems to locate food primarily by scent. It emits loud sniffs as it forages. Diet primarily is invertebrates such as beetles, earwigs, grasshoppers, ants, termites, moths, earthworms, centipedes, millipedes, slugs, and snails, but fruits, fungi, and small vertebrates such as small mammals, eggs and chicks of ground-nesting birds, frogs, and lizards also are eaten. It does not seem to be dependent on free water.			The Southern African Hedgehog is predominantly nocturnal and usually emerges in evening to forage but exhibits some diurnal activity following rainfall, probably to feed on emerging earthworms. It generally moves about slowly but is capable of remarkable bursts of speed. It rests by day curled up in a ball under matted grass or in leaf litter, rocky crevice, or hole in the ground. Such resting sites are changed daily unless they are being used to rear young or for hibernation. During warm rainy season when food is abundant, it gains weight. In cool, dry winter when availability of food declines and ambient temperatures decrease, the Southern African Hedgehog becomes scarce and burrows into loose sandy soil to hibernate. Hibernation is characterized by low oxygen consumption, low respiratory rate, and lowered body temperature. During this time, fat reserves accumulated in wet season are used to obtain energy. It appears that it can modify length of torpor in response to availability of food and energy. Hibernation is in June-September and is slightly less in northern parts ofits distribution. It remains torpid for up to six weeks at a time and temporarily arouses during warm weather. Torpor ends when temperatures increase in spring. Both sexes can lose c¢.15% of their weight during three months in hibernation.	Apps (2012), Beer (2003), van der Colf & van Aarde (1992), Dippenaar & Baxter (2013a), Ellerman et al.

Although it primarily is insectivorous, it also eats scorpions, other invertebrates, small vertebrates, eggs of ground-nesting birds, and fruits. In years when the desert locust (Schistocerca gregaria) is plentiful, it forms the bulk of the diet. It has a fondness for ripe melons that are an important summer crop. It also feeds on fallen mulberries and silverberries (Elaegnus, Elacagnaceae). It may be cannibalistic, more so in captivity than in the wild. Breeding. In non-mountainous areas where there is some monsoon influence, Brandt's Hedgehog possibly breeds throughout the year. Litters usually are born in late spring and early summer (April-May). Average litters have 3—4 young (range 1-6). Eyes open in 21-23 days, and teeth appear in 26-28 days. There is no evidence that more than onelitter is produced each year.

The Common Long-eared Hedgehog is not desert adapted, but it is moderately tolerant of heat and drought, and its large ears might be important in thermoregulation. It is rare in sparsely vegetated areas. It favors mesic sites such as suburban parks and gardens, olive groves, and agricultural lands and is commonly associated with humans. In Pakistan,it is plentiful above elevations of 900 m and can occur in valleys up to 2500 m. In Iran, it spends days in shallow burrows, beneath mud walls, or in piles of hay. In Egypt, it often is in buildings, crevices in walls, piles of bricks and stones, fissures in rocks, small caves, graveyards, and burrows of the Fat Sand Rat (Psammomys obesus) in salt-marsh habitats. It selects soft ground such as sandy dunes where it can dig relatively deep burrows that slope at a slight angle.	The Common Long-eared Hedgehog is omnivorous,it is a voracious feeder, and it can survive for up to ten weeks without eating or drinking. Diet primarily is insects (bugs, beetles, grasshoppers, termites, lepidopterans, ants), but it also eats other invertebrates (worms, millipedes, and snails), small vertebrates (mammals, birds, snakes, and lizards), eggs, carrion, fruits, and seeds. It seems immune to poisons and stings of insects and other invertebrates and will hunt and eat scorpions, venomous spiders, and stinging hymenopterans. It will kill and eat small snakes, some venomous, by rolling into a ball after grabbing the lower body of the snake so that the snake strikes in vain against the spines, often damaging itself. The Common Longeared Hedgehog feeds on grapes, mulberries, and watermelons, which it hollows out. It does not eat food discarded by humans, and captive individuals show a tendency toward cannibalism. Even with its protective spines,it is an important source of food for carnivores.			The Common Long-eared Hedgehog is nocturnal and begins foraging early in the evening. Day-resting sites usually are in burrows that are under small shrubs or bushes. Burrows are 20-150 cm long and have a single opening. Rest sites occur in caves and crevices and under piles of rocks and bricks. Long limbs enable it to walk and run quickly. It is an active digger and will excavate its own burrow when abandoned dens made by rodents or other mammals are not available. Generally, it excavates burrows under large rocks and can dig in sandy, clay, or rocky soils. Digging employs broad-clawed forefeet to loosen and throw soil backward; snout is not used in digging. The Common Long-eared Hedgehog periodically moves backward up its burrow and kicks out accumulated soil using hindfeet. In firm soil, 30-38cm burrows are completed in 3-4 hours. In soft soil,it can dig a 10cm hole in five minutes and can dig several burrows each night. It enters and exits burrows headfirst. Females widen ends of burrows to accommodate young. During early spring when insects and other invertebrates are plentiful, it builds up a layer offat. It can enter torpor in any season during droughts, shortages of food, and cold or hot weather, and it can remain partially awake, or sufficiently conscious, to react quickly to any disturbance. Even during short periods of torpor and estivation, respiration is slow and shallow, and heart rate decreases. Body temperature usually remains within 1-2°C of ambient temperatures. In regions where temperatures in winter are as cold as —6-5°C, body temperature during hibernation can approach 0°C. In North Africa, it can enter torpor during the cold season (December—February) and remain in its burrow 5-40 days. In northern India, it might hibernate up to 3-5 months in winter, and in the mountains of Pakistan, hibernation occurs in October-March and can be 5-5-6 months. In China, it enters torpor in October and emerges in spring. During hibernation, the Common Longeared Hedgehog wakes up periodically and might emerge briefly to forage or move only within its nesting burrow. In warmer areas, there is no prolonged hibernation in winter.	Al-Behbehani & Ibrahim (2007), Al-Khalili (1990), Arslan et al. (2009), Atallah (1977), Batsaikhan et al.

The Indian Long-eared Hedgehog tends to avoid hot, dry deserts.	The Indian Long-eared Hedgehog is omnivorous and will grab and eat any prey that it can overcome. When foraging,it takes short, rapid steps and appears to depend primarily on scent to locate food. It sniffs with its snout in roots of grass or leaflitter in search of insect larvae. Venomous snakes are grabbed anywhere on the body, and with spines erect and head lowered,it keepsits face partially concealed so that the reptile strikes against spines and injures itself. When an Indian Longeared Hedgehog seizes a snake or limb of a large animal, it will roll itself into a ball and begin chewing on the held portion. Diet primarily contains insects, especially dung beetles and orthopterans (mole crickets, crickets, and grasshoppers), but other insects and arthropods; earthworms; small vertebrates including frogs, toads, lizards, snakes, eggs and nestlings of ground-dwelling birds, and small mammals; carrion; and fruit also are eaten. Cannibalism is common. Females will eat their offspring, and males will attack and eat any young they encounter.	NW, EC & SE Pakistan and NW & NC India.	https://zenodo.org/record/6639380/files/figure.png	In summer,the Indian Long-eared Hedgehog escapes intense desert heat by being strictly nocturnal in foraging activity. It emerges at dusk and forages for 5-6 hours. When food is plentiful, it returns to its burrow by about midnight and does not emerge again until the following evening. It is an active digger and excavatesits own burrows. Opening of burrow is entirely or partially concealed under a bush, and if the ground is hard,it can be short, extending no more than 30 cm. In softsandy soil, the burrow can be 150 cm deep. Burrow terminates in slightly wider chamber that is unlined. An individual that descends head first into and out ofits burrow can turn around inside the small chamber. Burrow usually slopes down to ¢.30-35 cm below the surface and will be used by the same individual for an entire year.

In linear sand dune country, Central Desert Marsupial Moles appear to favor dune flanks and crests and avoid the hard loamy sediments of the dune swales. On the western margin ofits distribution, in the vicinity of the Warburton Range, the Central Desert Marsupial Mole may occur in regional sympatry or syntopy with the Northwestern Marsupial Mole.	Information on the diet of the Central Desert Marsupial Mole comes from attempts to maintain them in captivity and from analysis of gut contents of museum specimens. Captive individuals have accepted numerous food items including eggs, larvae, and pupae of various insect species including ants and termites, earthworms, centipedes, spiders, and gekkonid lizards. Larvae of longicorn beetles ( Cerambycidae ) and scarab beetles ( Scarabaeidae ), moths (Lepidoptera), and commercial mealworms (larvae of Tenebrio molitor , Tenebrionidae ) have been acceptable food items, but adult beetles seem to be rejected. B. Spencer reported his captive Central Desert Marsupial Moles fed readily on ant eggs, larvae, and pupae, but he postulated that adult ants are ingested coincidentally. F. Wood Jones found earthworms ( Lumbricus sp. , Lumbricidae ) to be acceptable to captive Central Desert Marsupial Moles, but others have had the opposite experience. At any rate, earthworms are not usually available in the sandy desert environment occupied by Central Desert Marsupial Moles. There are no observations of feeding above ground by free-living Central Desert Marsupial Moles. Captive individuals will sometimes feed above ground, but they more often grasp large prey items in the mouth and burrow underground to consume them. Small food items like ant or termite eggs are simply licked from the surface, but larger items may be held down or sometimes suspended by forelimbs while they are grasped in the mouth or chewed. Reduction of large food items appears to take place through progressive reduction in the posterior premolar and molar region, and there is no attempt to tear off pieces of food. Gut contents of Central Desert Marsupial Moles have contained a variety of invertebrate prey items and some plant material, most often grass seeds. A specimen examined by C. Brazenor in the mid-1950s contained burrowing sawfly larvae ( Pergidae ), ants of the genus Rhytidoponera ( Ectatomminae ), and legs of leaf beetles ( Chrysomelidae ). K. Winkel and I. Humphrey-Smith examined ten specimens of Central Desert Marsupial Moles and found remains of adult predatory ants (/ridomyrmex spp., Dolichoderinae ), seed-eating ants ( Myrmeciinae ), and their eggs, larvae, and pupae. Grass seeds were also present, but these may have been ingested accidentally from underground caches maintained by Myrmeciinae . More recently, C. Pavey and coworkers examined gut contents of 16 Central Desert Marsupial Moles and compared prey abundances in soil cores taken on sand ridges in the general region of original capture. Five insect orders ( Coleoptera , Hymenoptera, Isoptera, Lepidoptera, and Orthoptera ) were represented in gut samples, along with scorpions, spiders, and plant material. Two main prey types were dominant: social insects (ants and termites) and larvae of beetles. Ants, termites, and beetle larvae also dominated samples obtained in soil cores. Termites alone were potentially underrepresented in gut contents compared with their natural frequency. Results suggest that the Central Desert Marsupial Mole is a dietary generalist despite its specialized adaptations for a subterranean lifestyle.	Sandy deserts of C Australia (S Northern Territory, SE Western Australia, and W South Australia), including portions of the Great Victoria, Tanami, and Great Sandy deserts, and possibly parts of the Simpson Desert; it also occurs in sandy tracts within the desert uplands around Alice Springs, S Northern Territory.	https://zenodo.org/record/6621657/files/figure.png	There has been much speculation regarding timing and environmental correlates of surfacing behavior of the Central Desert Marsupial Mole, but none of the hypotheses are supported by any field data. Surfacing may take place primarily in the evening when soil surface temperatures are dropping but before night air temperatures fall dramatically. Some individuals located on the surface during the day seem to have been moribund while others may have been forced to the surface by high groundwater after flooding. Otherwise, nothing is known about activity patterns of free-living Central Desert Marsupial Moles.	Bennison et al.

The North-western Marsupial Mole has been collected at fewer than 15 localities in Gibson, Little Sandy, and Great Sandy deserts of Western Australia; however, information from Aboriginal informants suggests a much broader distribution that probably takes in ¢.30% of the land area of Western Australia—a huge and largely unpopulated area. At the south-eastern extremity of its distribution,in the vicinity of the Warburton Range, the North-western Marsupial Mole may occur in regional sympatry or syntopy with the Central Desert Marsupial Mole.	The diet of the North-western Marsupial Mole has not been studied either in the field or from examination of gut contents. A captive individual held in the laboratory of P. Withers of the University of Western Australia initially proved difficult to maintain, although it later seemed to feed avidly on large insect larvae collected from the stems of dead grass trees (Xanthorrhoea sp., Xanthorrhoeaceae ). Mealworm larvae ( Tenebrio molitor , Tenebrionidae ) were refused. The individual inexplicably stopped eating and died after five weeks in captivity.

Its general behavior conformed to reports on captive Central Desert Marsupial Moles. Whether above or below the surface, it alternated between bouts of frenetic activity and periods of immobility during which it appeared to be asleep. When brought to the surface, it usually burrowed again rapidly.	Benshemesh (2004), Benshemesh & Aplin (2008), Benshemesh & Burbidge (2008), Burbidge & Aplin (1996), Burbidge et al.

Small-toothed Ferret-badgers find food mainly by smell and sound and use their digging claws and probing snouts to dig for roots and earthworms.			Nocturnal and crepuscular. Active year-round, but less active during the winter months. During the spring, both sexes are active outside their burrows for around eight hours; during the winter this decreases to less than six-and-a-half hours. Rest sites are in burrows, rock crevices, or in trees. In south-east China , radio-collared Small-toothed Ferret-badgers used a variety of shelters as daybeds including rodent dens (47%), firewood stacks (20%), open fields (17%), and rock piles around houses (5%).

They are often found near rivers, streams, and wetlands, from sea level to 1500 m elevation, but mostly below 500 m . However, on the east slopes of the Andes Mountains in Bolivia they range up to 2000 m . A radio-collared female spent 27-8% of her time in open habitats (69-2% of her prey came from there); the remaining 72-2% was spent in closed woodlands and forests (where she obtained 27-8% of her prey).	The diet includes small mammals, birds, eggs, amphibians, reptiles, invertebrates, and fruit. In Venezuela , seven stomachs contained remains of diurnal rodents (Sigmodon alstoni), a lizard (Ameiva ameiva), a dove (Zenaida auriculata), and an eel-like fish. Two other stomachs contained an opossum (Didelphis marsupialis), an unidentified rodent, a lizard (Ameiva ameiva), and an amphibian (Colestethus auriculata). In Para, Brazil , a Greater Grison was observed carrying a large toad (Bufo marinus) in its mouth, apparently unaffected by the toad’s toxic skin glands. In Panama , a Greater Grison was seen pursuing an Agouti (Dasyprocta punctata) at 08:15 h; another Agouti was attacked in a river at midday. In Peru , a Greater Grison was observed eating a piranha-like characin fish. In north-eastern Brazil , Greater Grisons are major predators of Rock Cavies or Mocos (Kerodon rupestris), which they attack in their burrows. The stomachs of two males and two females contained Moco remains and another species of cavy (Galea spixii). Greater Grisons hunt alone, in pairs, or in small family groups. An adult female was seen travelling in association with a nearly grown male and a three-fourths grown female.			Primarily diurnal, but occasionally active at night. A captive male from Ecuador was nearly 100% diurnal, with a rest period of several hours at midday. Three captive Greater Grisons in Panama were very active in the early morning and late afternoon and rested for four to five hours around midday. Greater Grisons forage during the day at Cocha Cashu, Peru . However, in Venezuela , a radio-collared individual was active for 10-12 h per day, mostly at night (77-1% of the time); all sightings were in the daytime (06:00-11:25 h). Rest sites are undertree roots or in hollow logs, underground burrows, or rock cavities.	\Wozencraft (2005), Yensen & Tarifa (2003a).	Galictis	vittata

Most localities in Bolivia are between 2000 and 4200 m . Lesser Grisons frequently occur near water.	The diet includes small mammals (especially rodents and lagomorphs), birds, eggs, amphibians, reptiles, invertebrates, and fruit. In central Chile , the diet was found to consist of 352% rodents, 26-5% introduced European Rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), 20-7% unidentified mammals, 14-7% reptiles (Liolaemus chiliensis and Philodryas chamissonis), and 2-9% unidentified passeriform birds. Average prey weight was 350 g . In Patagonia, Argentina , the diet is 46-:3% rodents, 18-9% lagomorphs, 17-9% lizards, and 16-8% birds; as lagomorph density increases,its percentage in the diet increases up to 96-8%. In coastal south-eastern Argentine , mammals, including rodents (79-1%, at least eight species) and European Hare Lepus europaeus (20-9%), are the main prey items year-round; birds (7-8%) and invertebrates (5-2%) are also eaten. Lesser Grisons frequently prey on guinea pigs and are capable of running down and killing Dwarf Cavies (Microcavia australis).			Active mainly during the day, with occasional activity at night. Rest sites are in hollow trees, crevices, boulder piles, burrows of other animals, at the base of Polylepis trees, amongst tree roots and rocks, or in banks adjacent to wet meadows at high elevations. Four or five individuals may occupy a burrow system, which may reach 4 m in depth. One burrow system occupied by five individuals in Chile was on a slope among rocks and roots of a Guevina avellana tree in Nothofagus obliqua woods; leaves of Greiga obscured the entrances.

The diet is mainly insects and small rodents, but birds, eggs, reptiles, amphibians, and invertebrates are also eaten. In South Africa , the percentage occurrence of food items in 21 stomachs was 62% insects, 38% mammals, 10% birds, 10% arachnids, 5% frogs, and 5% myriapods. In the Cape Province , stomachs contained birds, mammals, reptiles, and insects (Coleoptera, Coleoptera larvae, Orthoptera, Lepidoptera, and Diptera). One stomach from Kalahari National Park, South Africa , contained mostly reptile remains. In Botswana , twelve stomachs contained insects, reptiles, and small mammals. Most prey are detected by sight or smell, and captured after stalking or short chases. Larger mammals, such as ground squirrels (Xerus) and spring hares, are followed to their burrows and killed. Zorillas often hunt for invertebrates in loose soil, plant debris, and at the base of grass tufts. Typically, a Zorilla pushesits nose into loose soil and sniffs audibly. When food is detected,it is excavated with the forefeet. Slow prey are bitten directly, whereas faster-moving prey, such as moths, mantids, or beetles, may either be bitten or pinned to the ground with a forefoot and eaten head first. All parts of insects are eaten. Rats (Rattus) are located mainly by sight. On occasion, rats are stalked and quickly captured or are chased. They are captured either by direct biting or by being pinned to the ground with the forefeet and then bitten. Mostkilling bites are directed at the back of the neck, head, or chest. Rats larger than 140 g usually require more bites and pinning with the forefeet. Occasionally, Zorillas roll while biting. Large rats are eaten by biting at the flesh and holding the skin with the forefeet. Birds presented to captive Zorillas are quickly and easily killed by a bite at the head, and then eaten head first. Zorillas will consume young birds completely, but they leave most ofthe feathers, feet, and tibia of mature birds. The contents of broken eggs are readily consumed, but captive Zorillas experience initial difficulty with unbroken eggs. Eventually, they learn to open them by biting or rolling the egg against a hard object such as a rock. Once cracked, the egg is easily opened and consumed. Zorillas will kill snakes and can attack large cobras. Snakes are approached cautiously and bitten on the back several times, after which the Zorilla retreats rapidly. Each bite is directed to the posterior half of the snake and is accompanied by vigorous shaking. After four or five such attacks, the Zorilla pins the snake to the ground with the forefeet, and repeatedly bites 10-15 cm from the head. Some of the bites involve vigorous shaking. Most snakes are eaten head first, but occasionally the tail or even flanks may be consumed first. Lizards are captured following short chases, pinned to the ground with the forefeet, and killed by a bite at the head. Lizards are entirely consumed and eaten head first. Amphibians are pinned to the ground with the forefeet and killed by biting the head and neck region; all parts of amphibians are eaten.

It is generally not found on higher mountain ranges, but has been recorded up to 2100 m . In Europe, the Marbled Polecat inhabits steppes with sparse hawthorn bush and sloe trees, and oldfields. In western Yugoslavia , they occur in montane-steppe and woodland-steppe areas. In eastern Yugoslavia , Marbled Polecats are found from river terraces and low hills to mountainous meadows. In western Serbia , they inhabit the outskirts of settlements. On the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt , one adult male was captured in a sparsely vegetated sandy area. In Lebanon , Marbled Polecats are restricted to cultivated areas in close association with humans. In Israel , they live in the steppes and hills. In Central Asia, the Marbled Polecat is found in oases, tugai (river-valley complexes of forest, scrub, and meadow), dunes with sparse bush vegetation, clay steppes, and salt marshes;it is also found in irrigated country, melon patches, and vegetable fields, and sometimes enters buildings to forage. In Kazakhstan , Marbled Polecats are found in shifting dune country containing saxaul (Haloxylon), winter fat (Ewrotia ceratoides), and pea tree, and in salt marshes overgrown in saxaul. Marbled Polecats are also found in wormwood deserts, semi-deserts, and occasionally fescue and needle-grass steppes of the foothills. In north-western China and the Ordos Desert, the Marbled Polecat occurs in forested areas, and in Siberia, it inhabits the western foothills of the Altai and the Cuya steppe.	The diet includes small mammals (ground squirrels Spermophilus sp., Gray Dwarf Hamsters Cricetulus migratorius, Libyan Jirds Meriones libycus , mice, voles, and rabbits), birds, reptiles, amphibians, snails, insects, and fruits. In Quetta and Kandahar, rodents, small birds,lizards, snails, and beetles are eaten. In Israel , Marbled Polecats show a high seasonal variability in the diet. During summer, mole crickets (Gryllotalpa gryllotalpa) make up 66% of the diet, whereas in winter, 62% of the diet is rodents, such as voles (Microtus guentheri), House Mice (Mus musculus), Lesser Blind Mole Rats (Spalax leococon ehrenbergi), and Meriones sp. Marbled Polecats may take small poultry. Excess food may be cached for later use. The eyesight of Marbled Polecats is quite weak and they rely principally on a well-developed sense of smell. They have two kinds of killing bites: the first is the penetration of the prey’s body by the canines, and the second is crushing the prey without canine penetration. To kill small vertebrate prey, Marbled Polecats crush the thorax. If the prey struggles, they may pin the prey down with the forepaws and deliver headshakes or follow up by a bite to head or neck. On large prey, such as Guinea Pigs (Cavia porcellus), a Marbled Polecat bites the nape of the neck and eventually severs the spinal column at the base of the skull. With rats, it bites the throat. Fleeing prey are bitten dorsally, but defending prey are bitten on the head or neck.			Mainly nocturnal and crepuscular, but sometimes active during the day. Den/rest sites are in burrows of large ground squirrels or other rodents, or they dig their own dens. Marbled Polecats in Central Asia live in tunnel systems dug by the Great Gerbil (Rhombomys opinus). In Baluchistan , they live in burrows dug by the rodents or they may use underground irrigation tunnels. Sleeping chambers are 60-100 cm from the den entrance. In winter, they line the den with grass. When a Marbled Polecat digs, it presses its chin and hindpaws firmly to the ground and removes earth with its forelegs. Obstacles such as roots are pulled out with the teeth.	Ben-David (1998), Ben-David et al. (1991), Gorsuch & Lariviére (2005), Qumsiyeh (1996), Wozencraft (2005, 2008).	Vormela	peregusna

They can be found up to 2200 m , but are more common below 1500 m . In KwaZulu-Natal , South Africa , questionnaire surveys revealed that 75% of sightings occurred in grasslands, 19% in young pine plantations, and 6% in cultivated land.	The diet mainly consists of small mammals, particularly rodents, but also includes reptiles, insects, and birds’ eggs. Out of twelve stomachs obtained in KwaZulu-Natal , six contained small mammals (Mastomys natalensis, Rhabdomys pumailio, and Mus minutoides). African Striped Weasels hunt by scent, with vision being used only in the last 50 cm . Their shape enables them to hunt inside the burrows of rodents. When prey is sighted, the weasel stops and then lunges at the prey; short chases may occur. In captivity, all prey were killed within seven minutes. Prey are seized by the back of the neck. African Striped Weasels do not shake the prey when attempting to kill; instead, they roll around and vigorously kick at the back of their victim, possibly dislocating the neck and immobilizing the prey. Although most killing bites are directed at the back of the head and the neck, females may use throat bites when killing large prey. In captivity, African Striped Weasels were unsuccessful in killing rats (Rattus) that were more than 108% the mass of the weasel. One weasel can consume 3-4 mice in a night, but surplus killing may occur. Prey may be cached for future consumption. Small mammals are eaten head first and are usually entirely consumed. Occasionally, the prey’s stomach and its contents are not eaten. The head,tail, legs, and dorsal skin of large rodents are typically not consumed.

Generally, they prefer waterways with well-vegetated shorelines, and avoid areas with no shoreline vegetation. They inhabit the murky waters of southern alluvial valleys as well as the crystal-clear waters of rocky mountain streams. In many areas, they occur in close association with American Beavers; Beaver ponds provide prey and dens/rest sites.	The diet is mainly fish, but also includes amphibians, crustaceans (especially crayfish), rodents, molluscs, reptiles, birds, and fruits. In many areas, the abundance and availability offish is the primary determinant of North American River Otter abundance. Typically, fish are consumed in inverse proportion to their swimming abilities: slow-moving species are captured and eaten more often. In coastal areas, the fish eaten are those that are abundant, intermediate in size, and found close to shore. North American River Otters hunt by sight and by touch. They inspect logjams, pools of deeper water in shallow streams, areas below waterfalls, natural eddies, or any other areas likely to hold fish and other prey. Upon detection, prey are pursued until captured. In shallow or murky water, North American River Otters hunt and detect prey with their vibrissae or by feeling with their forefeet. They can remain underwater for up to four minutes, and can swim at speeds of 11 km /h. They may hunt in small family groups, herding fish to shore or to each other to facilitate capture.			Mainly nocturnal, with some crepuscular activity; diurnal activity increases during colder months. Active year round, even when water freezes in winter. Rest sites are in dry bank dens, Beaver lodges, or other natural cavities accessible from underwater.

Primarily fish eaters; adults consume an estimated 3 kg offish daily. The main fish species eaten are from the suborder Characoidei and are 10-60 cm in length. Other prey items are rare, but may include crabs, small mammals, amphibians, birds, and molluscs. There are records of Giant Otters eating large prey such as anacondas and other snakes, black caimans, and turtles. On the Jauaperi River in the central Brazilian Amazon, remains of fish were found in all spraints. The main fish groups were Perciformes ( Cichlidae , 97-3%), Characiformes (86-5%) and Siluriformes (5-4%). The Characiformes were represented mainly by Erythrinidae ( Hoplias sp. 90-6%), followed by Serrasalmidae (28%). The Anostomidae occurred with a frequency of 18:7%. On the Aquidauana River , the Characiformes were the most frequent fish group, represented in 100% of all samples, followed by Siluriformes (66-6%) and Perciformes (33:3%). Prey is caught with the mouth and held in the forepaws while being consumed. Small fish may be eaten in the water, but larger prey are taken to shore.	Amazon and Orinoco basins from Venezuela to Paraguay and S Brazil . Formerly also Argentina and Uruguay , but now may be extinct there.	https://zenodo.org/record/5714209/files/figure.png	Diurnal. Giant Otters frequently go ashore to groom, play or defecate. Rest sites are in burrows, under root systems, or under fallen trees. At certain points along a stream, areas of about 50 m * are cleared and used for resting and grooming. Dens may consist of one or more short tunnels that lead to a chamber about 1-2- 1-8 m wide. Nine vocalizations have been distinguished including screams of excitement and coos, given upon close intra-specific contact.

They prefer waterways with clear water, abundant waterside vegetation, and high availability of potential den sites; they are rare or absent from sluggish, murky, lowland waters. In Northern Mexico , along a 30 km stretch ofriver, the habitat preferred by a Neotropical Otter included pools that averaged more than 0-8 m deep, more than 14- 6 m wide, with over 64% understory vegetation cover, and rock talus/vegetation cover within 4-8 m of the water's edge.	The diet is mainly fish, but also includes crustaceans, molluscs, small mammals, birds, reptiles, and insects. In southern Brazil , spraint analysis revealed a diet comprising mainly fish (including Loricariidae, Callichthyidae, Cichlidae , Pimelodidae, Auchenipteridae, and Erythrinidae ), and also mammals and insects. In the coastal plain of Santa Catarina State , southern Brazil , spraints contained fish (mainly Hoplias malabaricus and Geophagus brasiliensis ) and crustaceans (mainly the river crab Trichodactylus fluviatilis). The presence of fruits, reptiles, birds, and mammals in the diet was occasional and opportunistic. On Ibera Lake, Argentina , 205 spraints contained mainly fish ( Cichlidae , Characidae, Synbranchidae, Loricariidae, and Erythrinidae ), but also crustaceans and molluscs. Seasonal variation was observed in the diet: in the summer, crustaceans and vertebrates (other than fish) increased. A higher percentage of benthic fish species was also observed in the summer, while pelagic and benthopelagic species increased in the winter. Such dietary changes may have resulted from the different habitat used in different seasons, from the lake coast in winter towards a more internal marshy area in summer. Foraging dives last 20-30 seconds. Small prey are eaten while in an upright position at the water’s surface; large prey are taken ashore.			Mainly diurnal, with activity peaks in the middle or late afternoon. May become nocturnal in areas of high human activity. Rest sites are in natural cavities along riverbanks, in excavated burrows, or in dense grass. In Brazil , two large caves were also used as shelters and to raise young. Neotropical Otters mainly use rest sites located high on riverbanks, probably because they are less vulnerable to flooding. Sprainting sites are usually on solid, high and dry areas, in close proximity to deep water; these sites include logs, root systems, rocks, sand bars, and planks under bridges.

They spend most of their time within 150 m of shore, but occasionally may venture into freshwater tributaries flowing into the sea.	The diet is primarily crustaceans, molluscs, and fish, but also includes birds, small mammals, and fruit. Along the Chilean coast, the diet consists of crabs (69-8%), fish (19:9%), shrimp (6:4%), and molluscs (3-9%). On the Valdivian coast in the south of Chile , spraints contained 25 species: 52% crustaceans, 40% fish, and 8% molluscs. Marine Otters showed opportunistic feeding behavior, selecting prey seasonally according to their availability. Marine Otters fish by first swimming to a hunting area, where they then dive underwater for 6-64 seconds. Captured prey are consumed in the waterif they are small enough to be handled easily, or taken ashore if larger. Crabs are almost always taken ashore. Prey can be carried in the mouth, or carried on the belly while swimming dorsally. Unlike Sea Otters, Marine Otters do not use rocks as anvils to crack open bivalves or shellfish. At Isla Choros, northern Chile , Marine Otters spent more time foraging in a wave-protected site compared with a wave-exposed habitat. Successful dives reached 26-9% in the wave-exposed habitat and 38-2% in the wave-protected habitat. Foraging dives were 18% shorter in wave-exposed as compared with wave-protected habitat.	Pacific coast from N Peru to S Chile , and extreme S of Argentine Patagonia.	https://zenodo.org/record/5714213/files/figure.png	Mainly diurnal. Marine Otters spend about 40% of their time hunting and 60% resting or grooming. They make extensive use of caves, rock crevices, and natural cavities for resting sites. Many areas used for resting at low tide are underwater during high tides.	Castilla (1981), Eisenberg (1989), Lariviere (1998), Medina (1995), Medina , Boher et al. (2007), Medina , Rodriguez et al.

Although marine mammals, they rarely venture more than one km from shore. Typically, they live and forage in waters at depths of up to 100 m , but the highest densities of Sea Otters occur in waters less than 40 m deep.	The diet is mostly marine invertebrates such as abalones, sea urchins, crabs, and molluscs. Other prey include squid, octopus, chitons, tubeworms, scallops, and, very occasionally, fish. In the northern Kodiak Archipelago, clams were the most frequently identified prey (57-67%, mostly Saxidomus giganteus); mussels (Mytilus sp.), crabs (primarily Telmessus sp.), and green sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis) contributed 25% to the diet. On the north side of the Alaska Peninsula, the dominant prey species in 50 spraints were mussels (Mytilus edulis), followed by three species of clams (Siliqua sp., Spisula polynyma, and Tellina lutea), sand dollars (Echinarachnius parma), and helmet crabs (Telmessus cheiragonus). In south-east Alaska , butter clams (S. giganteus) are the major prey items. Sea Otters on the outer coast of Washington feed heavily on bivalves (63%) and have a diverse diet consisting of several prey groups. In contrast, Sea Otters in the Strait ofJuan de Fuca have a restricted diet dominated by more than 60% red urchins (Strongylocentrotus franciscanus), with only two other prey species comprising more than 10% of their diet. Sea Otters forage in both rocky and soft-sediment areas on or near the ocean floor. They have good underwater vision and most prey is captured by sight. Prey hiding under rocks or in crevices may also be captured by feeling with the forefeet. Underwater dives are sustained by lungs that are 2-3 times larger than those of similarsized terrestrial mammals. Most hunting dives last 50-90 seconds. In coastal Washington , the average dive time was 55 seconds and average surface time was 45 seconds, irrespective of dive success. At least 77% of all dives were successful in capturing prey. Prey capture success was significantly lower for subadults (63%) than adults (82%). Sea Otters break the exoskeleton of large or hard-shelled prey by hitting the prey item on a rock carried by the otter on its belly. Sea Otters face a tremendous thermoregulatory challenge because of their constant life at sea. When in water, buoyancy and insulation are provided by their fur and the air bubbles trapped within it. The integrity of their pelage is thus essential to thermoregulation. Their metabolic heat production is 2-3 times greater than that of similar-sized terrestrial mammals. To sustain such heat production requires that Sea Otters consume 20-33% of their body mass in food daily. Sea Otters can drink seawater, and their kidneys produce very concentrated urine to avoid unnecessary water loss.			Generally diurnal, with peaks in activity at dawn and dusk. Daytime foraging increases when females care for young. In Prince William Sound, Alaska , more time was spent foraging (30%) than on any other activity, and foraging bouts were longer than all other activities. Sea Otters rest by floating belly-up in the water with their feet out of the water. They sometimes rest on rocks near the water and often spend the night in a kelp bed, lying under strands of kelp to avoid drifting while sleeping. Ten vocalizations have been described for Sea Otters including screams of distress (heard especially when mothers and young are separated) and coos (heard mostly when individuals are content or in familiar company).

In Argentina , they are associated with dense mature forests that have thick undergrowth extending close to the shore of water bodies. In southern Chile , radio-tracked Southern River Otters used rivers more frequently than expected, whereas they avoided small streams. Temperate evergreen swamp forests and river and stream banks with a high density of riparian vegetation, woody debris and exposed roots, were found to be the preferred habitats; canalized rivers and streams lacking these characteristics were avoided.	The diet is mostly fish (under 10 cm in length) and crustaceans, but also includes molluscs and birds. The relative importance of each food type may vary seasonally or geographically. In central Chile , the diet comprises 75% fish and 63% crustaceans; the highest occurrence of fish occurs in the spring and summer. In the southern marine habitats of Chile , Southern River Otters feed mainly on fish. In Argentina , crustaceans largely dominate the diet (99%) and fish occur rarely (less than 2%). Differences in the proportion offish and crustaceans in the diet may reflect the differential availability of prey types in different habitats: fish productivity is low in freshwater lakes compared to the oceans, which may explain the high proportion of crustaceans in freshwater lakes.	Argentina and Chile .	https://zenodo.org/record/5714221/files/figure.png	Primarily nocturnal, with occasional activity during the day. Den/ rest sites are rock crevices, hollow trees or logs, earth banks, or under root systems; Southern River Otters may excavate their own dens. Dens occur from 0-7 to 50 m from the shoreline; most are within 3-8 m of the water’s edge. They often have multiple terrestrial but no underwater entrances. The density of dens along the southern coast of Chile was 2-8 per km of coastline. Latrines are common near den entrances or inside dens; they are 50-80 m from one another and 3-6 m from water.

They avoid areas of deep water.	The diet is mainly fish, frogs, and aquatic invertebrates (including crustaceans and crabs). Birds and small mammals (such as rodents and lagomorphs) may be consumed on occasion. In general, the mean proportion offish declines from 94% on seashores, to 71% on lakes and fish ponds, to 64% on rivers and streams. On inland waters, the abundance of crayfish is an essential food item. In Northern Ireland , over 50% of spraints were composed of sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus), salmonids and cyprinids, with Sticklebacks constituting the most frequently occurring prey category. The frequency of occurrence of eels ( Anguilla anguilla) was found to be consistently higher in spraints collected from smaller streams. In eastern Poland ,fish constitutes 51% of the food biomass consumed in spring-summer and 40% in autumnwinter, with perch (Perca fluviatilis), pike (Esox lucius), and roach (Rutilus rutilus) being captured most frequently. Amphibians (mainly Rana temporaria) make up 34% of the food biomass in spring-summer and 58% in autumn-winter. The cold season diet depends on river size. On small rivers with forested valleys, Eurasian Otters feed nearly exclusively on amphibians (72-90% of food biomass). As the size of the river increases, and riverside habitat becomes more open (sedge and reed marshes instead of forests), Eurasian Otters shift to catching predominantly fish (up to 76%). In southern Poland , the main component of the diet is fish (47-9%, including brown trout Salmo trutta and rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss). Other important food items are 21-4% frogs ( R . temporaria) and 30% birds, small mammals, aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates, and plant debris. In southern Italy , spraint analysis revealed that fish represented the dominant food (57-3% mean volume), followed by amphibians (18:9%) and crayfish (15-6%). Seasonal variations in fish consumption were related to changes in fish activity and to environmental conditions; the importance of fish decreased in winter, when flooding increased water speeds and turbidity, and thus reduced the hunting efficiency of the otters. Hibernating amphibians represented a primary alternative resource. Insects and reptiles were eaten more frequently in summer, while birds predominated during their breeding season. In Hungary , the primary food is fish (89-8% for riverine and 87-5% for backwater habitats); Eurasian Otters living in riverine habitats, compared to backwaters, consume more birds (3-9% and 0-7%, respectively), less mammals (0-5% and 0-9%, respectively), less reptiles and amphibians (5-6% and 10-2%, respectively) and less invertebrates (0-1% and 0-6%, respectively); most fish eaten are small-sized (below 100 g ), and the most frequently taken species is Carassius sp. In Iran , the major food items are 38-1% chub (Alburnoides bipunctatus) and 34-8% carp (Cyprinus carpio). Prey are captured with the mouth, but the forepaws are used to handle the prey for consumption.

They seldom venture more than 10 m away from water and prefer shallow, freshwater areas, where there is continuity of lakeside vegetation, low pollution, and no crocodiles. In KwaZulu-Natal , South Africa , Spotted-necked Otters were most often located in rivers (40% of 706 locations) and near dams (45%), with only occasional use of swamps (3%) and oxbow lakes (2%).	The diet includesfish (Barbus, Clarias, Haplochromis, Micropterus salmoides, Salmo trutta, and Tilapia ), crabs (Potomonautes), and frogs (mostly Xenopus laevis and Rana). Insects and birds are also occasionally eaten. Crabs are the major dietary item during spring, summer, and autumn, whereas fish dominate in winter. Most fish consumed are less than 20 cm in length. In the fish-rich waters of east and central Africa, the diet consists almost entirely of fish, whereas in the fish-poor waters of South Africa , crabs and frogs are consumed in addition to fish. On Lake Victoria, Tanzania , 61% of spraints collected contained 46% Haplochromis , 14% Tilapia , catfish (Bagrus or Clarias), and 1% crab (Potamon niloticus). Direct observations of feeding Spottednecked Otters also revealed a diet dominated by Haplochromis . On Lake Muhazi, Rwanda , 154 spraints contained 80% fish, 10% insects, 3% molluscs, 2% birds and frogs. In Eastern Cape Province , South Africa , the diet is mostly fish (47%), crabs (38%), and frogs (8%). In KwaZulu-Natal , the frequency of occurrence of food items in 516 spraints was 64% fish, 43% crabs, 43% amphibians, and 18% insects. In contrast, 228 spraints collected near a troutriver contained 39% crabs, 38% fish, 20% frogs, 2% insects (mostly dragonfly larvae, Odonata), and unidentified birds. In a non-trout area, 66 spraints contained 30% crabs, 27% frogs, 25% fish, 10% birds (mostly Anatidae and little grebe Tachybaptus ruficollis), and 5% insects. In three stomachs from the Cape Province , South Africa , one contained crabs, one contained frogs and fish, and one contained frogs,fish, a beetle (Coleoptera), and a caterpillar. Spotted-necked Otters generally fish alone and almost all fishing is done within 10 m from the shore. When fishing in groups, cooperation among individuals may help facilitate prey capture by herding fish toward each other. Fishing in groups probably occurs when females are training their young. Fish are captured during short dives of less than 20 seconds. Once underwater, a Spotted-necked Otter scans for prey, turning its head from side to side. Prey are detected visually and pursued until captured. Crabs, fish, and frogs are captured with the mouth; the forefeet are not used in prey capture. Fish smaller than 10 cm are consumed in the water, but larger fish are taken to shore for consumption. Fishing forays typically last 10-20 minutes, but may last up to 3 h.

Rest sites are in rock cavities, bank dens, holes in root systems, or dense vegetation. Spotted-necked Otters can dig their own burrows. In KwaZulu-Natal , resting sites were among trees and shrub roots (29%), reeds (21%), small islands near dams (23%), tall grass (14%), swamps (11%), and sheltered places among rocks (2%).

They occur mostly in fresh water; some populations inhabit saltwater coasts, but because they require fresh water to drink, even coastal populations occur near freshwater tributaries. They also occupy many natural or man-made lakes and reservoirs, but prefer areas of shallow water. In South Africa , African Clawless Otters prefer riverine habitats covered with dense vegetation, while areas of short grass are avoided. They also select areas with boulders and/or reed beds, which provide high crab density and shelter. In southern Nigeria , African Clawless Otters are mainly restricted to brackish streams (with mangrove vegetation along the banks) and, more occasionally, transitional habitats between freshwater and brackish-water environments.	African Clawless Otters are primarily crab eaters, but other foods such as frogs, fish, and insects are consumed. Fish increases in importance in the diet during winter, when they are lethargic and easier to capture. Lobsters, octopus, and shellfish are eaten along the seacoast. In two reserves in the Eastern Cape Province , South Africa , the diet was more varied at Mkambati (15 prey species) than Dwessa (seven species). In terms of relative percentage frequency of occurrence, the spiny lobster (Panulirus homarus) was found to be the most common prey item at both Mkambati (37-9%) and at Dwessa (35-2%), followed by fish (31% and 36-6%, respectively), crabs (22:4% and 19-7%) and molluscs (3-1% and 4-2%). Lobster and fish are relatively abundant within these reserves, suggesting prey availability rather than selective feeding influenced diet. At another site in the Eastern Cape Province , the three most common prey categories found in otter spraints were the crab Potamonaules perlatus (51%), insects (19%), and the fish Tilapia sparrmanii (18%). At Betty’s Bay, South Africa , fish are the most important prey category (59% of the biomass), followed by octopus (15%), red rock crab Plagusia chabrus (13%), cape lobsterJasus lalandii (10%), and the brown rock crab Cyclograpsus punctatus (0-8%). In eastern Zimbabwe , the diet is mainly the river crab Potamon perlatus (42%). African Clawless Otters use various hunting methods. In shallow or murky water, they detect crabs with their forefeet as they feel around underwater rock crevices. Prey is grabbed with the forefeet and then bitten and eaten. In shallow but clear water, African Clawless Otters may immerse their heads and scan for prey visually while feeling under rocks with the forefeet. In deeper water, they dive straight down and can remain underwater for up to 50 seconds. African Clawless Otters eat small prey while they swim upright at the surface, whereas larger prey are taken to shore for consumption. In South Africa , African Clawless Otters were observed to select open water within 8 m of the shore. Foraging involved moving into shallow water (c. 0-2 m deep) and walking along the substrate feeling for prey with the forefeet. African Clawless Otters prefer hunting at depths of 0-5- 1- 5 m.			Mainly nocturnal, but may be active during the day in areas remote from human disturbance. Rest sites are in burrows (holts), under large rocks or root systems, or in dense vegetation near water; they may dig their own burrows. In South Africa , the occurrence of spraints, couches and resting places is closely tied to freshwater sources; holts are located adjacent to river banks, oxbow lakes, or dam shores, and spraint sites are found in dense, tall grass cover beside water less than 1 m deep. In the Tsitsikama Coastal National Park, South Africa , the activity at several holts indicated about 32% utilization, with an estimated one otter to every three holts.	Angelici et al.

They prefer waterways with banks that are rocky and well vegetated. Smooth-coated Otters are notrestricted to deep water and often forage in small, shallow rivers and seasonally flooded swamps during the monsoons (July-September) and early winter (October-February) in India and Nepal . They commonly inhabit rice fields adjacent to mangroves along coastal areas. In Malaysia , Smooth-coated Otters were found to be more abundant in mangroves. On Java, they are restricted to coastal wetlands. When occupying saltwater areas, Smooth-coated Otters require freshwater nearby.	The diet is mainly fish, but may also include small mammals, invertebrates (insects, crabs, and crustaceans), frogs, snakes, and birds. Most fish consumed are 5-30 cm in length. In Rajasthan , India , spraints contained fish (96%), insects (7%), birds (5%), molluscs (3%), frogs (1%), and worms (1%). At Periyar Lake in Kerala , India , fish were found to be the major prey: 32% tilapia ( Tilapia mossambica), 26% catfish (Heteropneustes fossilis), 16% curmuca barb (Gonoproktopetrus curmuca), 15% European carp (Cyprinus caprio), 3% Deccan mahsheer (Tor khudree), and 1% Periyar barb (Barbus micropogon); a higher intake of bottom-dwelling catfish was observed during periods of low water. Other food items were 4% frogs, 2% crabs, 0-7% birds, and 0-02% insects. In Nepal , spraints contained mainly fish; minor food items were frogs, crabs, shrimp, snakes, and insects. In Perak , Malaysia , Smooth-coated Otters eat mostly fish (82% of spraints, mainly Trichogaster pectoralis), followed by molluscs, mammals, and insects (Coleoptera). In Thailand , 70% of spraints contained fish, 13% amphibians, 11% crabs, 4% snakes, and 2% arthropods. Smooth-coated Otters forage in the less rocky areas of lake shallows. Most foraging activity occurs in water; they go on land to rest and defecate. Small fish are swallowed whole, but large fish are taken to shore.			Mainly diurnal, with a rest period around midday. Den /rest sites occur under tree roots, in openings created by piles of boulders, or in dense vegetation. Smooth-coated Otters often dig their own dens and they sometimes rest on bare sand and grassy areas along river banks. In Nepal , eight dens were in exposed tree roots and one was a tunnel in the sand. In India and Nepal , dens are found in swamps; these are sometimes used as natal den sites and nurseries. Spraint sites often smell of rotten fish. In Thailand , spraint sites occur on small rocks, sand banks, and large boulders, 1-3 m above water level. The mean number of spraints on each site was 2-2. Smooth-coated Otters often roll and rub on grassy areas, especially after defecation.

They sometimes occur close to human settlements.	The diet is primarily crabs and shellfish. Fish, amphibians, snakes, small mammals, and insects are also eaten. In Thailand , 95% of spraints contained the crab Potamon smithianus, 40% contained amphibians and fish, 15% contained small mammals, and 5% contained arthropods. The size of crabs consumed by Asian Smallclawed Otters reflects what is available in the watershed they inhabit. Asian Smallclawed Otters coexist with Eurasian, Hairy-nosed, and Smooth-coated Otters in numerous locations, including severalriver systems in Thailand and Malaysia . Although all three species consume the same prey, the Asian Small-clawed Otter is predominantly a crab eater, whereas the other species consume mostly fish. Prey are captured mostly by sight, but also by touch, using their dextrous forefeet. Shellfish are dug up and left in the sun so that the heat causes them to open, allowing Asian Small-clawed Otters to consume them without having to crush the shells.

They prefer areas with vegetative or rocky cover. In the mountains of south-east British Columbia, Ermines were detected in all forests surveyed; these covered the range from open dry Douglas-fir forests to dense wet western red cedar (Thwa plicata) and western hemlock (75uga heterophylla) forests, and from very recent clear-cuts to mature stands over 300 years in age. In a subarctic area in Finland , adult females were found to live in areas where the abundance of their preferred Microtus prey was the highest; dominant males lived in less productive habitats than females, but in more productive areas than non-dominant mature males.	The diet consists mainly of small mammals, such as voles, mice, rats, lemmings, squirrels, and lagomorphs, but also includes birds, eggs, lizards, frogs, snakes, insects, earthworms, and fruit. In Great Britain , the percentage frequency of occurrence in the diet consists of 65% lagomorphs, 16% small rodents, and 17% birds and birds’ eggs; males eat a greater proportion of lagomorphs than females, which eat more small rodents. In Denmark (where European Rabbits are absent), a dietary study showed that rodents are the most important prey group, constituting 84% of their diet (frequency of occurrence). Ermines ate birds and birds’ eggs more often than sympatric Least Weasels, while Least Weasels ate more insectivores. Ermines ate more Microtus voles and Water Voles than Least Weasels, while Least Weasels ate more Bank Voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) and Moles (Talpa europaea). In the Italian Alps, 60% of scats contained small rodents, indicating that they were the main prey. However, the frequency of occurrence offruits in the diet increased significantly in August, after rodent biomass had dropped by more than 50% in July. In the forests of New Brunswick , Canada , the frequency of occurrence of prey is 28-0% soricids, 24:6% arvicolines, and 17-3% cricetines; the Deer Mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus, 17-3%) and shrews (Sorex sp., 28-:0%) have the highest percent occurrence, whereas the Red Squirrel and the Eastern Chipmunk (7amius striatus ) comprise 11-2% of the diet. Ermines generally hunt in a zig-zag pattern, progressing by a series of leaps that are up to 50 cm long. Prey are located mostly by smell or sound, and are often pursued into underground burrows or under snow. Ermines usually kill prey by biting the base of the skull. They sometimes attack animals considerably larger than themselves, such as adult hares. Ermines may cache excess food underground for later use during the winter.			Primarily nocturnal, but can be active at any time during the day. Their long shape makes them sensitive to cold temperatures and this, combined with a high metabolic rate, requires that Ermines hunt constantly to fulfill their energetic demands. Short periods of activity and rest alternate every three to five hours. Dens/ rest sites are in crevices, among tree roots, in hollow logs, or in burrows taken over from a rodent. Several nests are maintained within an individual’s home range; these are lined with dry vegetation or the fur and feathers of its prey. Ermines can easily run over or tunnel in snow to escape predators and search for food.

They show a preference for open, brushy or grassy areas near water.	The diet consists mainly of rodents (voles, mice, and rats) and other small mammals (such as lagomorphs and squirrels), but birds, eggs, snakes, grasshoppers, and poultry are also occasionally eaten. Because of their larger size, males generally consume larger prey than females. In North America, Long-tailed Weasels feed upon a wide variety of small vertebrates, but concentrate on rodents and rabbits of small to medium size. The diet of tropical Long-tailed Weasels, although not well known,is thought to consist mainly of small mammals, rabbits, and birds and their eggs. Small-sized prey, such as mice and voles, usually are subdued when the weasel throws its body into a tight coil around the prey; these are then killed by a bite to the nape of the neck. Long-tailed Weasels can kill animals larger than themselves, such as rabbits. Large prey is initially grabbed by the most convenient part of the animal before a killing bite is administered. Underground mediumsized prey is subdued by a ventral attack and killed by grasping the throat, which results in suffocation.			Primarily nocturnal, but frequently active during the day. Den/rest sites are in hollow logs or stumps, among rocks, or in a burrow taken over from a rodent. Long-tailed Weasels spend large amounts of time exploring holes, crevices, root systems, brush piles, thick vegetation, and under the snow in winter, in search of prey.

The diet includes rodents (voles, hamsters, marmots), other small mammals (pikas, ground squirrels), birds, eggs, reptiles, and insects. In Hungary , the principle food consists of small mammals; their frequency fluctuates between 54% and 93%, reaching a maximum in summer. In all seasons, the most important prey is the Common Vole (Microtus arvalis) and the Common Hamster (Cricetus cricetus); in addition, the European Souslik (Spermophilus citellus) is occasionally consumed in spring and autumn, and Brown Rats (Rattus norvegicus) may be eaten in autumn. The European Hare is eaten only in winter (5%). The consumption of birds (mainly Passerines) is considerable in spring (38%) and autumn (29%). A stable isotope study revealed a diet that comprised 27% small mammals (Plateau Pika, Root Vole, and Plateau Zokor) and 47-7% adult passerine birds, with hatchlings contributing 25:6%.

They tolerate habitats with a rainfall of over 2000 mm (annually) as well as arid areas with less than 100 mm annual rainfall. Honey Badgers are found from sea level up to 4050 m .	The diet is mostly mammals, insects, amphibians, reptiles and birds, but also includes roots, berries, and fruit (such as ber Zizyphusjubata). Favorite foods are honey and the larvae of honeybees (Hymenoptera). However, their adaptation to burrowing, together with the abundance of subterranean animals found in six stomachs, suggests that honey is only a secondary food item. Consumption of honey may also be seasonal because it is more widely available in the drier months of the year. In October and November, Honey Badgers in the Kalahari Gemsbok National Park, South Africa , were found to eat mainly rodents, which occurred in 60% of scats and made up c. 30% of the volume of food. Ostrich (Struthio camelus) chicks, Spring Hares (Pedetes capensis ), Meerkats, as well as domestic sheep and goats, were also eaten. They are strong diggers, and do not hesitate to dig after rodents or other prey hiding underground. Food items are detected mostly by smell or sound. Excess food may be cached in a den. When Honey Badgers eat, the food is held between the front claws while the forelegs rest on the ground. Beehives are opened by tearing away the wood of trees; honey combs are also scooped out from the cracks of rocks with the claws of the forefeet. Grubs are removed from the comb with their incisors. The clay capsules of estivating lungfish (Protopterus aethiopicus), cases of insect pupae, carapaces of turtles, or skins of animals are peeled away to expose the softer inner parts to be eaten. Honey Badgers dig large spiders out of holes 15-25 cm deep in the ground. Fish are caught with the claws at the edge of streams or from drying pans. They may raid campgrounds or dumpsters at night and are widely blamed for breaking into poultry houses and apiaries. The anecdotal relationship between the Honey Badger and a bird, the greater honeyguide (Indicator indicator), may be mythical. Although these two animals may occur together at the nests of bees, a complete observation of this supposed symbiotic relationship, from the initial attraction by a greater honeyguide of a Honey Badger, through guiding to a nest by the honeyguide, to the breaking open of the nest by the Honey Badger does not exist.			Primarily nocturnal, although diurnal observations are numerous. Honey Badgers shelter in burrows, thick brush, caves, clumps of fallen bamboo, hollow trees, old ruins, rock shelters, dens excavated by themselves, or abandoned burrows. Hollow trees are entered from the top.	Begg, C. et al. (2005a, 2005b), Begg, K. (1995), Dean et al.

In British Columbia , they prefer open range and agricultural habitats that have fine sandy-loam and well-drained soils.	The diet includes small mammals (especially marmots, ground squirrels, prairie dogs, pocket gophers, cottontail rabbits, mice, voles, chipmunks, and squirrels), birds, eggs, reptiles, amphibians, and invertebrates (insects and molluscs). Carrion is also eaten. In British Columbia , the six main prey species are the Columbian Ground Squirrel (Spermophilus columbianus), Yellow-bellied Marmot (Marmota Slaviventris), Northern Pocket Gopher (Thomomys talpoides), Muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus), Southern Red-backed Vole (Myodes gapperi), and Meadow Vole (Microtus pennsylvanicus). In south-eastern Wyoming , prairie dogs were found in 57% of stomach and fecal samples from female American Badgers. The most common food item in the diet in west-central Minnesota and south-eastern North Dakota is small mammals (98%, primarily Muridae and Geomyidae). Other prey includes insects (40%), and birds and eggs (32%, mostly ducks Anatidae ). Reptiles, amphibians and molluscs are also eaten, but are less common than other foods. Insects and birds’ eggs are more common in the diet during spring (April-May) than summer (June-July). Birds are more frequent in the diets of adults than juveniles. In South Dakota , 40% of stomach contents were mammals, 35% were of plant origin, 10% were birds, 10% were insects, and the remainder was mostly inorganic materials. American Badgers obtain most of their food by excavating the burrows of fossorial animals. If large prey is taken, such as a rabbit, the badger may dig a hole, carry in the prey, and remain below ground with it for several days. There are reports of American Badgers forming a “hunting partnership” with Coyotes. The Coyote apparently usesits keen sense of smell to locate burrowing rodents and the American Badger digs them up with its powerful claws. Both predators then share the proceeds. The techniques used by American Badgers when hunting Richardson’s Ground Squirrels (Spermophilus richardsonii) have been observed. They frequently hunted hibernating squirrels in the autumn, sometimes hunted infants in the spring, but rarely hunted active squirrels in the summer. They always captured hibernating and active squirrels underground, but sometimes intercepted fleeing squirrels aboveground. The most common hunting technique used was excavation of the burrow, but plugging of openings accounted for 5-23% of hunting actions. Plugging occurred predominantly in mid-June to late July, before most ground squirrels hibernated, and in late August to late October when juvenile males were active, but other squirrels were in hibernation. American Badgers usually used soil from around the tunnel opening or soil dragged 30-270 cm from a nearby mound to plug tunnels. Theykill ground squirrels with a single grasping bite directed dorsally or laterally to the thorax. The canines and third upper incisors generally only bruise the skin, without puncturing it, but cause extensive hemorrhaging in the thoracic cavity. Food items are sometimes buried and eaten later.			Mainly nocturnal, but can be active at any hour. American Badgers rest underground in burrows; these are either self-excavated or are modified burrows that were initially made by another animal. The burrow can be as long as 10 m and can extend 3 m below the surface. A bulky nest of grass is located in an enlarged chamber; the entrances are marked by mounds of earth. American Badgers are active all year, but during severe winter weather they may sleep in the den for several days or weeks.	Anderson & Johns (1977), Armitage (2004), Azevedo et al.

In Hinode, a suburb of Tokyo , scat analysis revealed that during spring and summer, earthworms (Megaseolocidae) occur at high frequency in the diet, with berries (Rubus sp.), beetles, and persimmon (Dymopyrus kaki) also eaten during summer months. Scavenged food is eaten in early spring when earthworm availability is low, and in the autumn, Japanese Badgers switch from eating worms when Persimmon is abundant.	Japan (Honshu, Kyushu & Shikoku Is).	https://zenodo.org/record/5714139/files/figure.png	Primarily nocturnal, although sometimes active in the daytime. Breeding females, in particular, often forage during the day and in the spring. Between July and October, Japanese Badgers usually emerge from their setts around sunset and return around sunrise. After November, the time between emergence and return becomes shorter. From January to February, most activity ceases, and Japanese Badgers stay in their setts most of the time. The total hibernation period varies from 42-80 days, during which the body temperature is reduced. Den/resting sites are in underground burrows called setts or in couches. In Japan , the resting sites in each badger’s home range were found to be within 630 m of each other. Setts were sited within the core areas of home ranges and were mostly on a sub-ridge. Couches were mainly in deciduousforest, and along the forest edge, and were generally sited towards the periphery of home ranges.	Abramov & Puzachenko (2006), Kaneko (2001, 2005), Kaneko et al.

They prefer densely forested areas adjacent to open fields, up to 1700 m . Occasionally, they are found in suburban areas. In central Spain , European Badgers prefer mid-elevation mountain areas, where both dehesas (open woods with pastures) and pine forests prevail; lower elevation areas are avoided. They are associated with watercourses and prefer trees and rock covered areas. In the Swiss Jura Mountains, European Badgers use forests and wooded pastures in the winter and spring and grain fields in the summer and autumn.	The diet includes earthworms (Lumbricus terrestris) and other invertebrates (such as insects and molluscs), small mammals (mice, rabbits, rats, voles, shrews, moles, hedgehogs), birds, reptiles, amphibians, carrion, nuts, acorns, berries, fruits, tubers, and mushrooms. In forests, European Badgers rely predominantly on earthworms (on average, 62% in diets). In farmlands and pastures, earthworms and plant material (usually garden fruit and cereals) play equally important roles (34% each). In England , the main foods are earthworms, insects, fruit, and wheat; grass is also ingested in substantial quantities. Earthworms are the most frequent food items, but wheat is almost as important in terms of percentage volume. In Poland , earthworms constitute 82-89% of the biomass consumed in spring. In summer and autumn, the proportion declines to 56% in pristine forest, and to 24% in a mosaic of forests, fields, and orchards. Supplementary food items during this time are amphibians (in forests) and garden fruits (in a rural landscape). In Denmark , earthworms, small mammals, cereals, and arthropods dominate the diet. In central Switzerland , the diet comprises 55% faunal material and 45% vegetal material. Earthworms have the highest frequency of occurrence. Voles, insects, and maize are eaten during most of the year, but never in large volumes, while wasps, cherries, plums, and oats are eaten seasonally and in large volumes. In Italy , earthworms and maize are the staple foods and together account for 57% of the mean estimated volume. Earthworm consumption varies seasonally, with a marked decrease in summer; this decline is compensated by a significant increase in fruits eaten. Maize is consumed all year round with no significant seasonal variation (from 21% in summer to 44-6% in winter). Prey items include amphibians (9%) and mammals (7-2%, primarily rodents and lagomorphs). In a dry Mediterranean coastal habitat in central Italy , European Badgers feed primarily on fruits and insects (90% ofthe total amount of food eaten each year). Other less important food items include myriapods, molluscs, birds, and mammals; earthworms do not play an important role in the diet in any period ofthe year.	Europe, E up to Volga River, Russia ; also Caucasus and Middle East from Turkey , Israel , Lebanon , and Syria , to N Afghanistan .	https://zenodo.org/record/5714145/files/figure.png	European Badgers show crepuscular or nocturnal activity, generally starting after sunset and ending before sunrise, and are active on average for about eight hours per day. The highestlevel of activity is between 20:00 h and 03:00 h. During the day, they mainly rest in elaborate, communal burrow systems (setts) with numerous entrances, passages, and chambers, but other types of rest sites may be used. Setts may cover an area of 0-25 ha; they are used year after year and increase in complexity over time, and may eventually cover several hectares. There are two types of burrows: “main” setts (with many entrances) and small “outliers” (with usually only one entrance). Nests may be located 10 m from an entrance, 2-3 m below the surface, and have a diameter of 1- 5 m. Within a burrow system, European Badgers may utilize one nest for several months and then move to another part of the burrow. The living quarters are kept quite clean. Bedding material (dry grass, bracken, moss, or leaves) is dragged backwards into the den. Around setts, there are several dung pits, sunning grounds, and play areas. Well-defined paths, up to 2-3 km , extend from the sett to foraging areas. In south-western Spain ,setts are located almost everywhere, but European Badgers prefer easily dug, well-drained soils, with good vegetation cover within foraging habitats. They select sites with high surrounding shrub density, large shrubs covering the burrow, and close to the centre of the territory. During bouts of cold weather or deep snow, European Badgers may sleep in the sett for days or weeks. In northern Europe, this winter sleep may last several months. During this period, there is a substantial drop in body temperature and the badger lives off fat reserves accumulated in the summer and autumn. In south-west Portugal , main setts are the most frequently used restsites (62:3%); however, an average of 14 other resting sites are used in each territory. Females use more than twice as many occasional resting sites as do males. Generally burrows (predominantly main setts) are most frequently used during winter and autumn, whilst non-burrow shelters are preferred during spring and summer, when the weather is hot, dry and not windy. In northern Italy , ten setts (mean number of entrances = 2-1) were detected in the study area. Each radio-collared badger used 2-3 setts, occupying one sett from one to eight months before moving to another one. All badgers shared (although in different periods) one main sett located in the inner part of their ranges.	Balestrieri et al. (2004), Elmeros et al.

They are inhabitants of remote northern areas where there are few humans. Wolverines make greater use of forested areas during winter, and greater use of tundra during summer. Altitudinal movements may also occur seasonally, with higher elevations being occupied during the summer and lower altitudes during the winter, probably because of snow accumulation and prey abundance. In central Idaho , USA , radiotracked Wolverines used higher elevations in summer versus winter, and they shifted use of cover types from whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) in summer to lower elevation Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziezii) and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) communities in winter. Wolverines also preferred northerly aspects, but avoided roads and ungulate winter range. In British Columbia , Canada , radio-telemetry revealed that Wolverines negatively responded to human disturbance within occupied habitat; males tended to avoid helicopter skiing areas. Habitat associations of females were more complex, but in the summer they avoided roads and recently logged areas. In the Columbia Mountains, where winter recreation is widespread, females prefer alpine and avalanche environments where Hoary Marmot (Marmota caligata) and Columbia Ground Squirrel prey are found in the summer. During the winter, females tend to avoid areas with helicopter and backcountry skiing, and prefer areas where Moose (Alces alces) can be found.	The diet includes the carcasses of large ungulates, such as Moose and Reindeer (Rangifer tarandus). In many areas, Wolverines are dependent on the ability of larger predators, especially Gray Wolves, to provide kills. In coastal areas, they also feed on the carcasses of whales and seals that wash ashore. Wolverines also prey opportunistically on deer, sheep, small mammals (rodents such as Marmota and Myodes, lagomorphs, and ground squirrels), birds, and eggs. Berries, nuts and fungus are occasionally eaten. Within two study areas in British Columbia , scat analysis revealed a diet that varied regionally and seasonally: Moose, Reindeer, and Hoary Marmots were abundant and common prey items within both study areas. Mountain Goats (Oreamnos americanus) and North American Porcupine (Erithizon dorsata) were more frequent prey items in the Columbia Mountains, while Snowshoe Hare (Lepus americanus) and American Beaver (Castor canadensis ) were more frequent prey items in the Omineca Mountains. Reindeer, Hoary Marmots, and North American Porcupines were found in significantly higher frequencies in the diet of reproductive females. Predation on ungulates (such as Reindeer)is facilitated when there is deep snow. Wolverines kill larger prey by a bite at the neck or throat. Small rodents may be chased, pounced upon, or dug out of the ground. Excess food is cached for later use and is covered with earth or snow, or sometimes wedged in the forks of trees. In Alberta and British Columbia , cache sites were in stands of black spruce (Picea mariana) or mixed-wood of high complexity, dominated by conifers, and in which the trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) and balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera) component consisted of mostly dead or dying trees. These sites offered relatively good visibility of the surrounding area; caches were never located in the very dense homogenous spruce stands. Cache sites were classified as “simple caches”, composed of a single feeding site and/or excavation, and “cache complexes”, involving one or more feeding “stations”, latrines, resting sites, and climbing trees that may have been used as avenues of escape from competitors or predators. The better used cache complexes were accessed by numerous well-used trails made by the Wolverines themselves. Caches contained the remains of Moose that were believed to have been killed by Wolves.			Mainly nocturnal, but occasionally active during the day. Rest sites may be a rough bed of grass or leaves in a cave or rock crevice, in a burrow made by another animal, or under a fallen tree. In Alberta and British Columbia , resting sites were located on top of the snow in relatively open locations that offered good visibility of the surroundings. Wolverines do not appear to be hindered by deep snow and are active year round.	Aubry et al. (2007), Banci & Harestad (1988), Copeland & Whitman (2003), Copeland et al. (2007), Hedmark et al.

They sometimes occur in gardens, plantations, and in agricultural fields. Tayras may hunt in grasslands, although much of their time is spent in forested areas. In the Ilanos of Venezuela , Tayras are usually found along gallery forests; at night, they may cross extensive grasslands, presumably moving from one forest to another. In Veracruz , Mexico , Tayras generally are restricted to forested habitats. They are found in the Atlantic rainforest of Brazil , in deciduous and scrub forest of the Pantanal in Paraguay and Bolivia , and in gallery and scrub forest and tall grass savannas in Argentina , Bolivia , and Paraguay . In Belize , no significant habitat preference was found for the Tayra.	The diet includes fruits, small vertebrates, insects, and carrion. In Venezuela , three species of vertebrate (Echimys semivillous, Rhipidomys sp., and Iguana iguana) and four species of fruit (Genipa americana, Zanthozylum culantrillo, Guazuma tomentosa, and Psychotria anceps) were recorded from 18 scats; both FE. semivillous and G. americana were found in 50% of the scats. In Belize , four species of small mammals were found in 31 scats: Didelphis marsupialis (9-6%), Oryzomys palustris (22-5%), Sigmodon hispidus (32:3%), and Rattus rattus (29-0%). In addition, 19-4% small birds, 58-0% arthropods, and 67-7% fruit were found. The primary fruit eaten was Calocarpum mammosum. Additional fruits consumed included Cecropia mexicana, Astrocaryum standleyanum, and Spondias mombin. Prey and other foods are detected primarily by smell, as its eyesight is relatively poor. Prey are captured after persistent chases; the Tayra does not stalk or ambush prey.			Primarily diurnal, with peaks of activity in the early morning and late afternoon. On occasion, some nocturnal activity may occur, especially near human habitations. Rest sites are in hollow trees or underground burrows.	Galef et al. (1976), Michalski et al.

Preferred habitats are mature old-growth spruce-fir communities, with greater than 30% canopy cover, a well-established understory of fallen logs and stumps, and lush shrub and forb vegetation. They avoid large open spaces such as clearcuttings, but may use riparian areas, meadows, forest edges, and rocky alpine areas above the timberline. In the coastal forests of California, American Martens select the largest available patches of old-growth, old-growth and late-mature, or serpentine habitat; dense, spatially extensive shrub cover is a key habitat element. In Alberta , during the winter, American Martens use young forests, and mature/old coniferous and deciduous stands, according to their availability. In the Selkirk and Purcell Mountains of south-west Canada , American Martens were detected in all habitats sampled including recently logged areas, regenerating stands, dry Douglas-fir (Pseudosuga menziesii) forest and subalpine parkland. They selected for greater crown closure and older stands at the finer resolution; no selection for forest structure was detected at the larger resolution except that American Martens selected against increased overstory heterogeneity. They preferred coniferous stands over deciduous-dominated stands and were more abundant in wetter than in dryer areas. In a clearcut boreal landscape in western Quebec , in which black spruce (Picea mariana) is the predominant forest type , American Martens avoid open regenerating stands composed mostly of recent clearcuts with sparse regeneration. They do not select coniferous stands, even those that are mature or overmature, but prefer deciduous and mixed stands, a large proportion of which has a dense coniferous shrub layer. Winter home ranges usually contain less than 30-35% open or closed regenerating stands and more than 40-50% uncut forest. In south-eastern Labrador, American Martens avoid areas with low productivity and low canopy cover (<20%), but show no selection for tree species composition or cover among more productive forests. In eastern Newfoundland, mature coniferous forest is the dominant cover type in most American Marten home ranges and is the only forest type used proportionately more than its availability by resident individuals. Otherforest types used in proportion to their availability include coniferous scrub and insect-defoliated stands; open areas and sites recently disturbed by fire are avoided at this scale. In northern Maine, in an area where trapping and timber harvesting had been excluded for more than 35 years, American Martens were found to use nearly all the available habitat, although during the summer, they preferred stands that had substantial mortality caused by spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana). Mature, well-stocked coniferous forest was the least abundant forest type in the home ranges of both sexes, in both seasons, whereas mature, well-stocked deciduous forest was the most abundant.	The diet consists mostly of rodents and other small mammals, including voles, mice, chipmunks, squirrels (7amiasciurus and Glaucomys sp.), and lagomorphs, especially the Snowshoe Hare. Other food items include birds, eggs, reptiles, amphibians, invertebrates (insects, earthworms), fruits, and berries. In Newfoundland, Meadow Voles were the most prevalent food item found in scats (80% in summer and 47-5% in winter); Snowshoe Hares occurred in 28% of winter samples, and 16% other food types were found in scats during each season. In the mixed-conifer forests of southern Sierra Nevada , where the American Marten and Fisher are sympatric, the diet of Fishers appeared to include more remains of birds, lizards, hypogeous fungi, and insects than that of American Martens. However, the dietary overlap between these two species was high. The diets of both species were more diverse than previously reported in North America, perhaps due to the absence or rarity of large prey (Snowshoe Hares and North American Porcupines) or to a greater diversity of available prey types in the southern Sierra Nevada . American Martens hunt and find food by constant searching, sometimes in trees, and often tunnel under snow during winter to search for microtines.			Primarily nocturnal and crepuscular, but can be active during the day. Den/rest sites are in hollow logs ortrees, in rock crevices, or in burrows. Large logs, large snags, and large, live spruce and fir trees are important characteristics for den sites in the central Rocky Mountains. Squirrels provide important denning structures as well as prey for American Martens.	Buskirk (1984), Buskirk & MacDonald (1984), Clark et al.

They also occur in fragmented forests, hedgerows, and cultivated areas, and in close proximity to humans. They are generally found in more open environments than other marten species and appear to avoid conifer forests. In a fragmented agricultural landscape, Stone Martens were found to prefer areas with wood and scrub vegetation and watercourses with continuous vegetation along their verges; they tended to avoid arable land.	The diet consists of rodents, birds, eggs, reptiles, amphibians,insects, fruits, and berries. In France , voles (Microtus sp.) make up to 30-55% of the total diet; there is strong seasonality, with microtines eaten more often in winter and spring. In the Swiss Jura, mammals are the main prey, representing 37-9% ofall food items; Water Voles (Arvicola terrestris) were found in 90-4% of scats during peak vole numbers. In central Italy , fruit and berries are the staple diet, but mammals and birds are also important; the diet varies seasonally in relation to resource availability, with a predominance of fruit in autumn and insects in summer. In east-central Italy , the winter diet is almost completely frugivorous; fruit represents 84% of the total volume in the diet, with a 55% occurrence. Berries from juniperus (42-2%, Juniperus sp.) and from sloe (29-7%, Prunus spinosa) are the most common food items. In south-eastern Romania , birds (45-2% of the biomass) and mammals (36-1%) predominate in the diet; reptiles, amphibians, insects, and fruits are supplementary food. In the Caucasus, the diet is 85% murine rodents during the summer; vegetable matter forms a major part of the late summer and early fall food in some areas.

In Norway , they prefer spruce-dominated forests with large trees, and avoid clearcuts and open habitats. In north-east Belarus , the higher food abundance in woodlands on clay soil results in a higher population density and a more even distribution of European Pine Martens than in woodlands on sandy soil, where they mainly live in valley habitats.	The diet consists of small mammals (including mice, voles, and squirrels), birds, amphibians, invertebrates, honey, fruits, and berries. In western Scotland , European Pine Martens prey extensively on small mammals (particularly Field Voles Microtus agrestis) and birds. Invertebrates are also important dietary items, with a high intake of beetles (particularly Geotrupes sp.) from March to September. Predation on birds and the intake of earthwormsis highest during the winter;fruits (bramble and rowan berries) are also important in autumn and late winter. In the Scottish Highlands, the diet is very varied and includes small mammals, large mammal carrion, birds, insects, and fruits. Small mammals are consistently important, whereas large mammal carrion, fruits and insects, are seasonal; birds are eaten at all times of the year, but are not a major part of the diet. Although appearing to be opportunist feeders, European Pine Martens did have strong food preferences: of the small mammals eaten, 94% were Field Voles. Insect species were also selectively eaten. Beetles (Geotrupes stercorosus, Carabus sp., and Serica brunnea) and Hymenoptera (Vespula vulgaris and Bonibus spp.) were consumed in large numbers when encountered. The diet indicated that European Pine Martens foraged on the ground, in glade areas within the forest, around night-time. In northern boreal Finland , the analysis of 5677 scats revealed that the European Pine Marten is an opportunistic generalist;its most favored food being small rodents (especially Clethrionomys sp.). Snow cover decreased the consumption of Microtus sp., but not Clethrionomys sp. or the Wood Lemming (Myopus schisticolor). Other food items were: Eurasian Red Squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris), Mountain Hare (Lepus timidus), carcasses of Reindeer, eggs, birds, common frog (Rana temporaria), berries, and mushrooms. In north-east Belarus , the diet includes rodents, birds, fruits, and carrion. In woodlands on sandy soil, European Pine Martens specialize in feeding on carrion in the cold season and on berries in the warm season. In winter, Bank Vole densities and the biomass of carrion are crucial food factors. In central Poland , where the European Pine Marten and Stone Marten are sympatric, both species feed mainly on small rodents, birds, and fruits. Although there is a high overlap in the trophic niches of both species, European Pine Martens feed more frequently on rodents and birds and Stone Martens on fruits and insects. In north-west Spain , mammals constitute the main prey all year round (50% ingested biomass), followed by fruit (28-1%), birds (20-9%), insects (0-8%) and reptiles (0-2%). Small mammals are the major prey species (41:6% ingested biomass), mainly Apodemus sp. (19-1%). Mammals are the most consumed prey in spring (65:8%) and winter (79-5%). However, in summer and autumn, European Pine Martens feed mainly on rowanberries (Sorbus aucuparia) (summer: 49-7%, autumn: 59-9%), followed by mammals (summer: 27-2%, autumn: 30-9%). On the island of Minorca , a total of 28 different food items were identified in 723 scats. Small mammals were the most important food overall, constituting 34% of the volume. During March to April, small mammals were the principal food consumed (63% of volume), followed by birds (19%). From May to June, birds were the main food (40%), followed by small mammals. Plant material and insects were the most important foods from July to August, when they made up 68% ofthe diet. Excess food may be cached for later use.	Most of Europe up to Russia (W Siberia) and major Mediterranean islands (Mallorca, Minorca , Corsica , Sardinia, and Sicily); also Middle East in Turkey , Caucasus, Iraq , and Iran .	https://zenodo.org/record/5714165/files/figure.png	Mainly nocturnal. On the island of Minorca , radio-collared European Pine Martens were primarily nocturnal, being active at night 53% of the time in autumn/winter and 59% in spring; daytime activity levels were 19% and 14%, respectively. In Poland , radio-telemetry revealed that 69% of the martens’ active time was during the night. The activity rhythms of European Pine Martens vary between sexes and seasons. In spring, male activity peaks at 20:00-00:00 h, whereas in summer and autumn/winter, activity is bimodal, peaking at 18:00-22:00 h and 02:00-04:00 h. Female activity in spring is more evenly distributed than that of males, but in summer their activity peaks at 20:00-00:00 h. In autumn/winter, females have a bimodal rhythm, with peaks at 18:00-20:00 h and 02:00-06:00 h. In breeding females, activity rhythms change in the course of pregnancy and nursing. On average, European Pine Martensstart their activity 73 min before sunset and finish 87 min after sunrise. Females became active earlier than males, but both sexes terminate their activity at the same time. On average, both sexes are active for around nine hours per day; they decrease their activity from 13 hours per day on warm days to 2-5 hours per day on cooler days. The number of activity bouts per day varies from one to six (mean 2:6); the activity bouts of males are significantly longer (4 hours, on average) than those of females (3 hours). In the cold season, the duration of short inactive bouts increases and inactivity lasts longer in females than in males. Den/restsites are in hollow trees or logs, under debris, or under snow. In Great Britain , most dens are associated with trees (44-3%), rocks (27-6%) and buildings (13-:8%); 69-6% of all dens are elevated, although only 9-8% are in elevated tree cavities, perhaps indicating a scarcity of arboreal cavities.

In north-eastern Canada and United States , they also occur in fragmented, mixed woodlots interspersed with agricultural land. In California , mid-seral Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and white fir (Abies concolor) forest types compose the greatest proportion of Fisher home ranges in the Coastal Mountains; the greatest proportion of home ranges in the Sierra Nevadas are in the intermediate tree size class with dense canopy closure, and in mixed conifer forests. In south-central Maine , Fishers use a variety of forest types , especially during summer. During winter, they hunt intensively in dense patches of coniferous undergrowth (where Snowshoe Hare tracks are common) and use deciduous stands less than expected by availability.	The diet includes lagomorphs (especially the Snowshoe Hare), North American Porcupines, ungulate carrion, small mammals, birds, reptiles, invertebrates, and fruit. During the winter in British Columbia , 18 types of mammalian and avian prey were found in 256 stomachs. The most commonly occurring prey species were Snowshoe Hares, Red Squirrels, and Southern Red-backed Voles. The diet varied between sexes: female fishers consumed small prey more frequently than did males. In the mountains of California’s Sierra Nevada , where the Snowshoe Hare and North American Porcupine are absent, other mammals are the most frequent food item; however, reptiles (20-4%) and insects (55-7%) are major components of the diet, and at least six fungal species are also eaten. In the mixed-conifer forests of the southern Sierra Nevada , where Fishers and American Martens occur together, the diets of both species are more diverse than reported elsewhere in North America. Although the diet of Fishers includes more birds,lizards, hypogeous fungi, and insects than that of American Martens, the dietary overlap is high. The great diversity of the diet in these two species may be due to the absence or rarity of large prey (such as Snowshoe Hares and North American Porcupines) or to a greater diversity of available prey types in the southern Sierra Nevada compared to other areas. In south-eastern Manitoba , Fishers prey heavily on Snowshoe Hares (84:3% frequency occurrence). In Vermont , most of the diet is mammalian (72%), with avian prey (15%) and fruit (10%) of secondary importance. In south-central Maine , winter foods include apples, porcupines, hares, Eastern Gray Squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis), Red Squirrels, Northern Flying Squirrels (Glaucomys sabrinus), mice (Peromyscus), voles (Clethrionomys gapperi and Microtus), and shrews (Sorex and Blarina). The fall and winter diet in West Virginia and Maryland includes ten mammal species, four bird species, one gastropod species, and two types of vegetation. White-tailed Deer (Odocoileus virginianus) is the most frequent dietary component. Medium-sized mammals such as Northern Raccoon and small mammals such as Peromyscus sp. are also major dietary components, although small mammals occur less frequently than reported elsewhere. Diet overlap between the sexes was found to be considerable and differences between the sexes in the occurrence of major food groups (small mammals, medium-sized mammals, large mammals, birds, and fruit) were not significant. Hunting strategies vary with prey type . Snowshoe Hares are caught after rapid zig-zagging chases. Fishers hunt porcupines by searching for their dens. The arboreal skills of Fishers enable them to chase porcupines down trees to the ground, where they kill them after lengthy attacks, during which the Fisher repeatedly bites the porcupine’s face (which is unprotected by quills).			Active during the day and night; most activity occurs shortly before sunrise and after sunset. Males and females show similar amounts of activity, and both sexes are active more frequently in summer than winter. Den/rest sites are in hollow logs or trees, brush piles, or in rock crevices. Fishers in California select restsites in forested areas that have dense canopies, large trees, and steep slopes. In the Coastal Mountains and Sierra Nevada in California , standing trees (live and dead) are the most common resting structures, with California black oak (Quercus kelloggit) and Douglas-fir the most frequent species in the Sierra and Coastal areas, respectively. Resting structures are within the largest diameter trees available, averaging 117- 3 cm for live conifers, 119- 8 cm for conifer snags, and 69 cm for hardwoods. Females use cavity structures more often than males, while males use platform structures significantly more than females. The diversity of types and sizes of rest structures used by males suggests that males are less selective than females. In the Sierra Nevada study area, where surface water is less common, Fishers prefer rest sites within 100 m of water. In a central hardwood forest, Fishers were found to rest in hardwood, softwood, and mixedwood forest types in proportion to their availability in the summer, but tended to avoid hardwood areas in winter. They used nests, cavities, and burrows in proportionto their availability in winter, but in the summer, Fishers preferred nests to cavities, and burrows were not used. Males tended to use larger cavity trees and mixed forest stands more often than females. During spring, summer, and fall in south-central Maine , Fishers prefer using rest sites in the branches of conifers, within coniferous stands.	Arthur & Krohn (1991), Arthur et al.

The diet includes small mammals, birds, amphibians, invertebrates (insects, centipedes, spiders, crustaceans, earthworms), fruits, and seeds. In the Kuju Highland on Kyushu, the mean frequencies of occurrence of food items in scats were 79-7% animals and 511% plants. The diet comprised mainly insects, mammals, crustaceans, and 36 plant species. There were high frequencies of insects from June to October, mammals in February, April and December, crustaceans in August and October, and plants in October and December. Scats collected from the Tsushima Islands revealed that small mammals comprised a relatively stable proportion of the diet throughout the year (range 8-2 to 16-8%), whereas birds showed a peak from January (11-3%) to March (14:6%). Amphibians, mostly small adult frogs (Rana tsushimensis), were most common in the diet in February (9-7%). Insects were the most common animal prey, but their proportions in the diet varied greatly from 10-5% in May to 27-8% in August, and they were consistently least common throughout the winter. Centipedes (mostly Scolopendra subspinipes) were frequently eaten during May andJune (16:9-17-4%). Plant materials were the most common of all foods throughout the year (28:8-53-9%). Berries and seeds occurred at the highest frequency in April (41%, especially Rubus hirsutus and Elaeagnus pungens) and in September (47-3%, especially Vitis ficifolia and Ficus electa).

They typically prefer mature forests of large trees with a dense canopy. In the Daxinganling Mountains, China , Sables prefer late succession mixed forests, with large trees and coarse woody debris, intermediate to dense tree canopy cover, and high densities and diameters of larch tree holes. They avoid open areas, but use the middle of slopes and slope bottoms, and rest on ridge tops with abundant logs, boles, or roots.	The diet consists mostly of small mammals (rodents, pikas, hares), but also includes birds, reptiles, amphibians,fish, insects, fruits, honey, nuts, and berries. The summer diet in the Middle Yenisei taiga, Siberia, comprises microtine rodents, mainly Northern Red-backed Voles Clethrionomys rutilus (52-3% of the biomass). Plant food (seeds of Siberian pine Pinus sibirica and berries of Vaccinium sp.) is also frequently eaten (79-4% of scats and 19-9% of biomass). Shrews, birds, and insects are supplementary food (25% of biomass). In the Daxinganling Mountains, China , the winter diet is mainly small mammals (54-1%), berries and pine nuts (32:4%), birds (12-5%), eggs (2:2%), and ants (1%). The main small mammal prey is Gray Red-backed Voles (Clethrionomys rufocanus) and Northern Red-backed Voles (Myodes rutilus), followed by Mountain Hares (Lepus timidus) and Siberian Chipmunks (Eutamias sibiricus ). Birds include hazel grouses Tetrastes bonasia (8-1%), Eurasian jays Garrulus glandarius (0-7%), and great tits Parus major (0-5%). Plant items include berries of Vaccinium vitisideae (20-9%) and pine nuts of Pinus pumila (8:8%). In north-eastern China , remains of mammals were found in 89% ofscats, followed in frequency by soft and hard mast, and birds. Sables selected for C. rufocanus more than shrews (Sorex caecutiens), but ate C. rutilus in proportion to its availability. In eastern Hokkaido , Japan , the diet includes mammals, insects, plants, birds, reptiles, amphibians,fish, and crustaceans. Mammals are the commonest food items throughout the year, with voles Clethrionomyssp. (frequency of occurrence 56:5%), Siberian Chipmunks (19-3%) and mice Apodemus sp. (14:6%), most often found in scats. Insects are eaten mainly in the summer (48:8%) and less often in other seasons (9:3% on average).

They are rarely found more than 100 m from fresh water and prefer waterways with densely vegetated banks. In south-Western Europe, radio-collared European Mink used areas that had low forest cover and bramble or shrub cover along the riverbank; they avoided areas with dense forest cover. In south-western France , radio-collared European Mink had a strong preference for flooded habitats, particularly open marshes, flooded woodlands, and moorlands; they seldom left riparian forest corridors.	The diet includes small mammals, birds, amphibians, fish, molluscs, crabs, and insects. The chief prey is often the Water Vole. In northern Spain , scat analysis revealed a diet based on small mammals (relative frequency of occurrence 36:9%), fish (30-6%), and birds (17-8%). The Wood Mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus) was the most consumed small mammal and cyprinids (mainly Barbus sp.) were the most frequently eaten fish. The average size of consumed fish was 13- 5 cm , and the average weight was 31- 5 g ; males ate larger and heavierfish than females. In north-east Belarus , three out of nine individuals studied were specialists on frogs (77-97%, mainly the common frog Rana temporaria). One individual fed mostly on crayfish (Astacus astacus, 62%), and the other five were generalist predators. Excess food may be cached for later use.	Belarus , Estonia , France , Latvia , Romania , Russia (W of Urals), and N Spain .	https://zenodo.org/record/5714261/files/figure.png	Mainly nocturnal and crepuscular. Den/rest sites are in crevices, amongst tree roots and dense bramble patches, or in burrows, either self-excavated or taken from a Water Vole.

They are also found near human habitations.	The diet is mainly small rodents, but other small mammals (such as lagomorphs, moles, and squirrels), birds, eggs, lizards, frogs, salamanders, insects (mostly beetles), fish, worms, and carrion are also occasionally eaten. The proportions of different small rodent species in the diet roughly reflects their relative abundances throughout the year. In Europe and Russia , Microtus agrestris, M. arvalis, M. oeconomus, M. brandti, Arvicola terrestris, Clethrionomys glareolus, C. rutilus, Apodemus sylvaticus, Lemmus lemmus, and L. sibiricus are preyed upon. In North America, M. pennsylvanicus, M. ochrogastere, C. rutilus, C. gapperi, Peromyscus leucopus, P. maniculatus, Reithrodontomys megalotis, Sigmodon hispidus, Dicrostonyx rubricatus, D. hudsonicus, and L. sibiricus are eaten. In Great Britain , one study showed that the diet consists of 68% rodents (mainly Microtus agrestis), 25% lagomorphs, and 5% birds and birds’ eggs. The small size of Least Weasels enables them to pursue prey into their burrows, so much of their hunting is underground or under snow. Males readily shift to larger prey such as birds, lagomorphs, and Water Voles, while females continue to search for Field Voles. Thus, males generally take larger prey than females and spend less time hunting in tunnels. Least Weasels take five to ten meals per day. Excess food may be stored, especially in the winter; the cache site may be within the home burrow or near a kill. Killing behavior is innate. Least Weasels respond to movements of prey as a stimulus for attack. The killing bite is delivered at the nape of the neck and penetrates the base of the skull or throat area.			Active day and night. The high-energy requirements of Least Weasels mean that they have to be constantly active, so active and rest periods occur in rapid succession. However, the timing and extent of their daily activity is related to the activity patterns of their prey. Least Weasels may spend the whole winter under snow. Den/ rest sites are in prey burrows, in rock piles, or in other well-concealed sites. Vocalizations in captive animals consist of a repertoire of five different sounds, including a chirp, a hiss, a trill, a squeal, and a squeak.

They sometimes occur near humans, but avoid dense urban areas.	The diet consists of amphibians, small mammals, birds, fish, and invertebrates. In Switzerland , the diet of European Polecats is almost exclusively carnivorous, but somefruits are also eaten, mainly by juveniles. Anurans (frogs and toads; mainly Rana temporaria and Bufo bufo) are the staple food. Other foods of importance are small mammals (mainly Muridae, but also Microtidae and Soricidae), carrion, and eggs. The anuran proportion of the diet is higher in summer than in winter and higher in the mountains than in the lowlands. In mountainous regions, anurans are also the most important food in winter. Juveniles eat more fruits and invertebrates and fewer mammals than adults. Sex-related differences in the importance of the main food categories have not been detected. In Denmark , the stomach contents of 47 European Polecats revealed that they preyed mostly on amphibians (87%) and mammals (34%), and only occasionally on birds (9%) and fish (6%). In Poland , the analysis of 222 scats revealed that anurans (mainly R . temporaria) comprised 70 to 98% of the biomass consumed and were found in 60 to 95% of scats. Forest rodents (Apodemus flavicollis and Clethrionomys glareolus) constituted from 1-29% of the biomass eaten. The consumption of rodents grew with decreasing winter temperature and increasing numbers of rodents. Snow-tracking of individual European Polecats has shown that in wet forests, they move in close proximity to watercourses to search for anurans, whereas in the drier forests, they hunt rodents, mainly by digging. European Polecats constantly move as they search for prey, exploring burrows, hollow logs,trees, tree cavities, rock crevices, and farm buildings.	Most of Europe W of Urals, and Morocco .	https://zenodo.org/record/5714271/files/figure.png	Mainly nocturnal, but can be crepuscular and active during the day. In Luxembourg , radio-collared European Polecats were 62% active during the night. Males were more active than females, and activity increased from winter to summer. In central Italy , ten males and six females were monitored using radio-telemetry. Males exhibited a regular and constant nocturnal pattern in every season, preferring the time between 20:00-06:00 h; activity was lower at dawn and dusk, and scarce during daylight hours. Females were significantly diurnal and crepuscular, but individuals revealed a flexibility in their activity pattern, including arrhythmic patterns without apparent temporal organization. Den/rest sites include crevices, hollow logs, burrows made by other animals, and sometimes buildings. In Luxembourg , European Polecats were located in 53 different resting sites, during the day. Aboveground shelters were used more often than underground shelters. Piles of branches, barns and stables, garden sheds and rat dens, were the most used sites, without specific preference for any one type of shelter. However, buildings seem to be of prime importance during severe weather conditions.

They prefer densely vegetated areas and are sometimes found far from water. Females have been found to prefer small streams, whereas males prefer large streams.	The diet includes small mammals,fish, birds, eggs, amphibians, reptiles, and invertebrates, such as crustaceans, molluscs, insects, and earthworms. In much of North America, the American Mink is a major predator of Muskrats; fluctuations in Muskrat populations have a direct effect on American Mink abundance. In Eurasia, where the American Mink has been introduced, the staple food items on rivers and streamsare fish (average, 27%), mammals (30%), and amphibians (17%), whereas on lakes and ponds,it is predominantly birds (33%) and fish (28%). On the upper reaches of the Lovatriver, north-east Belarus , three out of ten American Mink were found to be small mammal specialists; 86-92% of their scats contained remains of small rodents (mostly the Water Vole and microtines), and small mammals constituted 83-88% of the food biomass consumed; the other seven were generalist predators. In western Poland , the diet of American Mink consists mainly of mammals, birds, and fish. In autumn-winter, mammals constitute up to 56%, fish up to 62%, and birds 4-16%, of the biomass consumed. In spring and summer, however, birds form 45-60% of the biomass eaten; the common coot (Fulica atra) is the most frequently consumed prey. Scat analysis in eastern Poland revealed that American Mink relied on three prey groups: fish (40% in spring-summer and 10% in autumnwinter), frogs (32% and 51%, respectively), and small mammals (21% and 36%). Of the available small mammal species, American Mink strongly selected the Root Vole (Microtus oeconomus). The cold season diet depended on river size. On small rivers with forested valleys, American Mink fed nearly exclusively on amphibians (72-90% of food biomass). As the size of a river increases and riverside habitat becomes more open (sedge and reed marshes instead of forest), American Mink shift to preying on small mammals (up to 65% in the diet). The stomach contents of 211 individuals in Thy, Denmark , revealed that the diet was mostly mammals (55% occurrence), followed by amphibians (36%), birds (33%), and fish (30%). In Bornholm, Denmark , American Mink prey mostly on birds (50%), followed by mammals (42%), fish (25%) and amphibians (4%). In Italy , the diet is mainly fish, followed by small mammals and birds. American Mink spend most of their time hunting near water, but can also hunt underwater. In a coastal environment of Scotland , radio-tracked American Mink were found to forage selectively at low or mid-tide and within the core areas of their home range; they showed no preference for areas rich in prey when foraging at high tide and between core areas. They also avoided areas with freshwater streams and preferred foraging in the mid-tide zone. Prey on land are detected by sight or sound. Surplus food is sometimes cached.			Mainly nocturnal, but with frequent periods of daytime activity, especially in areas away from humans. Den/rest sites are in burrows, hollow logs, hollow trees, rock crevices, old buildings, or abandoned dwellings of Muskrats, American Beavers, or Woodchucks (Marmota sp.). Burrows may be about 3 m long and 1 m beneath the surface, and have one or more entrancesjust above the water level. On the northern Iberian Peninsula, radio-collared American Mink selected resting places within dense scrub,close to deep water. Both sexes also used underground dens, but during cold days females rested in buildings much more often than males. Active females used areas of dense scrub, and males used large scrub patches.

Although they require water for drinking, they are able to make do with very little water, and seldom require access to it. Even lactating females can survive without water for over one week. The highest population densities reported for this species occur on the prey-rich plains of Kenya and Tanzania , and surprisingly, in the forests of the Aberdare Mountains in Kenya . In these areas, densities of Spotted Hyenas exceed one animal per square kilometer.	The foraging behavior of Spotted Hyenas is remarkably flexible. Long believed to feed mainly on carrion, these animals are in fact efficient predators that kill 60% to 95% of their prey themselves. On average across populations in which the relative proportions of hunted and scavenged foods have been documented, two thirds of their diet is derived from kills they make themselves, and only one third from scavenged food items. In addition to being able to obtain food either by hunting or scavenging, Spotted Hyenas exhibit extraordinary plasticity with respect to their prey preferences. Spotted Hyenas have catholic tastes, they are extreme opportunists, and they are able to exploit a vast array of potential prey types , ranging from caterpillars to elephants; they may also occasionally consume some plant material. However, in most parts of Africa, Spotted Hyenas derive the large majority of their food intake from only a small subset of the prey species available to them locally. In most environments, they focus on the local mediumand large-sized ungulates, capture of which yields the greatest caloric return while demanding the least effort and the fewest risks. Thus, in eastern Africa, Spotted Hyenas prey most frequently on Blue Wildebeest, zebra, gazelles and Topi. In the arid parts of southern Africa, they prey most frequently on Gemsbok. In Kruger National Park, their most common prey is Impala, and in western Africa, common prey includes Red-fronted Gazelles and Hartebeest. Foraging behavior varies with the prey currently sought. Spotted Hyenas search for gazelle fawns by wandering upwind through open grassland in a zig-zag pattern. They may dig for crocodile eggs along large rivers, and snap flying termites out of the air with their jaws. When hunting, Spotted Hyenas modify their behavior to take advantage of the most abundant prey species, or the species thatis easiest to catch; these change seasonally in some localities with the migratory movements of particular ungulate species. Instead of using felid-like stealth as a primary hunting tactic, Spotted Hyenas rely on their extraordinary endurance for success in hunting. They can run at speeds of up to 55 km /h, but at slightly lower speeds, they can maintain a chase for several kilometres. If the antelope being chased becomes winded, and turns to defend itself with its horns, the Hyenas rush in and start tearing off pieces of the prey animal’s flesh. Like canids, Spotted Hyenas kill their prey by disembowelling and dismembering them rather than by using a particularkilling bite. Spotted Hyenas may hunt either solitarily or in groups; in the latter case group size varies with the type of prey sought. Mean hunting group sizes among Hyenas in Kenya are 1-2 for Topi, 1-7 for Impala, 2-08 for Thompson's Gazelle, 2-92 for Blue Wildebeest, and 9-1 for zebra. Thus only zebra hunts involve large groups of hunters, and most hunting parties contain only one or two Hyenas. Ungulates such as Topi and Blue Wildebeest weigh roughly three times as much as an adult Hyena, but solitary Hyenas routinely kill these antelope. Although hunting group size is often surprisingly small among Spotted Hyenas, the feeding groups formed by these animals are often very large once a prey animal has been killed. The noise produced by feeding Hyenas often draws members of the clan that were not involved in the hunt to the kill site. Feeding competition among the Hyenas present at a kill is usually very intense. In East Africa, often more than 30 Hyenas can be observed trying to feed from a single carcass. Because of this intense competition, each individual Hyena consumes as much food as possible in a very short period of time. A group of 20-30 hungry Hyenas can reduce an adult Blue Wildebeest to nothing more than a pile of rumen contents in only 13 minutes. It is estimated that an adult Spotted Hyena can consume a mass of food equal to 25%-30% ofits body weight, and individual Hyenas have been observed to ingest up to 18 kg of meat and bone in one hour. However,as a result of limited access to carcasses, average food intake ranges only from 1-5 to 3-8 kg per day. Spotted Hyenas sometimes engage in kleptoparasitism, which is the aggressive acquisition of a fresh carcass from other predators. They have been observed displacingjackals, Striped Hyenas, Leopards, Cheetahs, and African Wild Dogs from kills. However Spotted Hyenas most frequently compete for kills with Lions. Spotted Hyenas and Lions occur sympatrically in many areas of Africa, and in most of these habitats, bi-directional food stealing has been observed between these two species. Dominance relations between Spotted Hyenas and competing species are not absolute but depend on the numerical presence of both parties. For instance, Lions usually displace Spotted Hyenas at kills. However, if Hyena group size is large and the ratio of Spotted Hyenas to female and subadult Lions exceeds four to one, Hyenas are often able to displace Lions from kills unless a male Lion is present. A single Spotted Hyena can usually dominate a Cheetah, Leopard, Striped Hyena, Brown Hyena, any species ofjackal, or an African Wild Dog. Spotted Hyenas have been observed caching surplus food in thickets and under water in ponds. These animals are very comfortable in water; they often play in seasonal pools, and lie in shallow water or wet mud to keep cool on hot days. Compared to the other bone-cracking hyenas, Spotted Hyenas rarely carry food to their young at dens. This appears to be because the risk of having one’s food stolen, even by much smaller hyenas,is very high at dens, particularly for low-ranking individuals.	Most of Africa S of the Sahara Desert, except in lowland tropical rainforests. Spotted Hyenas have been extirpated from many areas of southern Africa.	https://zenodo.org/record/6350110/files/figure.png	Spotted Hyenas are predominantly nocturnal and crepuscular, although they may be active at midday when temperatures permit. Dens are typically modified holes dug by Aardvarks, although caves are used as den sites in some areas. Only cubslive in dens; adults sleep above ground, often in thickets, particularly when midday temperatures are high. Although Spotted Hyenas are active for roughly one third of each 24hour cycle, their activity is not continuous. Instead, activity occurs in bouts interspersed with periods of rest. Hyenas in Kenya that were followed for complete 24hour cycles spent 32% of their time active, but 53% of their active time occurred during hours of darkness.

They are most common where rainfall is 100-600 mm. They do not occur in forests or pure desert and are independent of drinking water. The northern subspecies occurs in grasslands and tree savannas of the Somali-Masai Arid Zone and the southern subspecies in the Southern Savanna and South-west Arid Zone.	Aardwolves are solitary foragers and feed almost exclusively on Trinervitermes termites, usually on one species in each particular region: 1. bettionianus in East Africa, 1. rhodesiensis in Zimbabwe and Botswana and 71. trinervoides in South Africa . These termites are largely avoided by other termite-eating mammals due to the noxious terpenoid chemicals secreted by the soldier termites, to which the Aardwolfis uniquely tolerant. In addition to the lack of competition, Aardwolf preference for this termite genus is likely due to the fact that these termites regularly congregate at night in large aboveground foraging parties. The termites are licked directly from the soil surface, and are easily obtainable in large quantities. Also, unlike true harvester termites, Trinervitermes forage throughout the year, making them a dependable year-round food source. Due to the small size of Trinervitermes and the wide dispersion of colonies, female Aardwolves must forage for at least six hours a night, during which up to 300,000 termites/night (1-2 kg) are consumed. Foraging Aardwolves travel approximately 1 km /h, with their ears cocked forward and head bentslightly down, following an erratic zig-zag route. Because they often approach termite colonies from downwind, and approach with directed movement before termites could be seen,it appears that termite foraging parties are detected at least partially by smell. However, the hearing of the Aardwolf is particularly acute and is assumed to play a role in colony detection. The average time spent foraging at individual termite patches was 20-28 seconds in East Africa, but in drier Namibian grassland, Aardwolves spent an average of 1-8 and 9-2 minutes at each patch in consecutive years of observation. In South Africa , a newly weaned four-month old cub spent an average of only eleven seconds at each patch, and juveniles frequently are seen vomiting after feeding on Trinervitermes, indicating that tolerance to the chemical secretions of Trinervitermes soldiers increases with age. Even adult Aardwolves maintain some aversion to the terpene chemicals, because they will avoid feeding on mounds under repair, where typically only dense concentrations of soldiers are found at the surface. Other surface-foraging termites, particularly Hodotermes and Microhodotermes ( South Africa ), Odontotermes and Macrotermes species (East Africa), make up a larger proportion of the diet when Trinervitermes are seasonally uncommon or unavailable, as during winter (May-August) in South Africa , and during the rainy season in East Africa. However, these species forage aboveground in much smaller parties (10-20 individuals vs. 4000 in Trinervitermes) and the reduced winter availability of Trinervitermes in South Africa results in a significant seasonal reduction in Aardwolf body weight and field metabolic rate. Aardwolves here were found to consume only one-sixth the number of termites in winter that they did in summer. Winter is also the highest period of mortality in Aardwolf cubs, which are 7-10 months old at this time, further indicating that this is a period ofsignificant energetic stress. Other termites found in fecal samples have included Odontotermes, Macrotermes, and Lepidotermes that are not surface-foraging species and therefore not important components of the Aardwolf diet. Occasional additional food items include ants and Coleopterans, yet the Aardwolf appears to be surprisingly inefficient at foraging on non-termite insects. Due to the high degree of specialization of its tongue for licking small arthropods, and the almost complete degeneration ofits cheek teeth, it is thought that they are unable to handle larger food items, making the species highly dependent on Trinervitermes. This dependence is supported by the absence of Aardwolves from Zambia and central and western Africa, where surface foraging Trinervitermes are either uncommon or available only a small part of the year. Aardwolves defecate in middens (also called latrines). The first defecation occurs when they exit the burrow in the evening and is typically very large, weighing up to 1 kg . Defecations are typically covered with soil. This practice of concentrating and burying their faeces, which retains some of the terpene smell of the soldier termites, has been suggested as a way of reducing the probability that an Aardwolf will mistake its own faeces for a termite colony when it is foraging. Up to 20 middens may be located in a territory.			Predominantly nocturnal, in South Africa Aardwolves are generally active for 8-9 hours a day in summer but only 3-4 hours a day in winter. In summer, they generally leave the den within an hour after sunset and return 1-4 hours before sunrise. However, during winter, some diurnal activity may be observed. Aardwolves typically become active up to an hour before sunset and return to their dens after 3—4 hours of foraging. A higher proportion of their time is spent feeding in winter than in summer, and a relatively large portion of the activity of both males and females in winter (12:6%) consists of breeding activities (e.g. courtship/copulation). Inactive hours during the day are spent in underground dens, which provide refuge from temperature extremes and predators, particularly Black-backed Jackals. Dens also function importantly in cub-rearing. Nighttime rest periods are also often spent near or inside dens. A territory may include up to ten different den holes, which are typically spring hare burrows that have been enlarged by Aardwolves.	Anderson, M.D. & Richardson (2005), Anderson, M.D. et al.

They do not need drinking water and inhabit areas where annual rainfall may be even lower than 100 mm , up to about 650 mm .	These hyenas forage alone at night and do not cooperate in hunting or in feeding, although group members tolerate each other at large food items. Although not competent hunters, Brown Hyenas are extremely efficient scavengers with an omnivorous diet. They are opportunistic feeders on a range of vertebrates, primarily mammals, the vast majority of which are scavenged, often from the kills of other carnivores. Fruits, insects and reptiles can be important supplementary foods when carcasses are rare. In one population 58 different food items were identified from fecal analysis. Brown Hyenas in the southern Kalahari spent 30% of their feeding time eating carrion, 28% on vegetable matter, 4-5% on small mammals, 1-5% on birds’ eggs, and 29% on unknown items. Only 5-8% of food they were seen eating was killed by the hyenas themselves. In the central Kalahari 35-9% ofall observed feeding bouts were on fresh scavenged kills, 33-9% on old carcasses, 16% on their own kills, and 12:5% on vegetative food sources. Brown Hyenas do not depend on standing water. In the central Kalahari, no free water orrain is typically found for eight months of the year. Although they will drink on a daily basis when water is present, much of the water during dry seasons is obtained from Cucurbitaceae fruits such as the tsama melon, gemsbok cucumber, and Hookeri melon, which can compose significant proportions of the diet in these seasons. Brown Hyenas inhabiting the Namibian coast feed almost exclusively on subadult Brown Fur Seals. The majority of these seals are thought to be scavenged, although Brown Hyenas have been seen hunting seal pups. In fact, hunting efficiency on seal pups during the peak pupping season can be as high as 47%, and an average of almost five seals per day may be killed from a single colony. Small rodents and seabirds make up the rest of this unique diet. Elsewhere hunting attempts by Brown Hyenas are opportunistic and directed at small mammals such as Springbok lambs, spring hares, Bat-eared Foxes, and ground nesting birds. The hunting technique of the Brown Hyena is unspecialized, rarely successful (except in the case of Brown Fur Seal pups), and may include a brief lunge at a surprised prey, a prolonged chase of up 1 km , or an attempt to dig up a burrowed animal. The percent of observed hunting attempts that were successful was 4:7% in the southern Kalahari and 13-7% in the central Kalahari. The hyenas generally feed where they find food, but food from larger carcasses is frequently cached nearby in a clump of grass or under a bush. Considerable time is often spent at carcasses removing limbs for this purpose and one animal may remove and cache up to three legs before any competitors arrive. Sites where food is cached are scent-marked and may be re-visited over multiple days. In a remarkable example of food caching in the southern Kalahari, a Brown Hyena arrived at an abandoned ostrich (Struthio camelus) nest with 26 eggs , which are prized food items. The hyena spent four hours carrying 14 eggs distances of 150-600 m from the nest, some of which it simply dropped in the open. It ate only three eggs during this period. Brown Hyenas also carry food back to cubs at the den. This provisioning of cubs can result in significant bone accumulations at densites. In the southern Kalahari the average distance moved between significant meals was 7-2 km, and the average nightly distance traveled was 31-1 km. During the dry season, nightly movements were longer and were recorded as high as 54-4 km. During the wet season movements were reduced and ranged from 10-20 km. In Namibia , daily distances traveled ranged from 15-47 km. When foraging, Brown Hyenas move at a pace of about 4 km /h, often walking in a zig-zag pattern, probably to maximize their chance of coming across food items. They use smell to locate much of their food, as evidenced by frequent sniffing and moving upwind toward food sources. Their hearing appears to be acute as well and is likely also used in foraging. The Brown Hyena is subordinate at kills to Spotted Hyenas, Lions and African Wild Dogs, although it appears to dominate Leopards in most situations. While they always dominate Cheetahs, they compete heavily with the much smaller Black-backed Jackal, which is often able to steal scraps from hyenas at carcasses. There is some evidence that, where they are sympatric, Brown Hyenas avoid areas frequented by Spotted Hyenas, potentially to avoid direct aggression and competition. For example, dens in the southern Kalahari were rarely found in the prey-rich riverine habitat where most Spotted Hyena dens occurred. Although their presence at livestock carcasses has resulted in much antagonism toward, and persecution of, Brown Hyenas by livestock owners, predation on livestock by these animals appears to be done by a small number of individuals. However, these hyenas, which typically target cow calves and sheep, can account for a large number of kills. Removal of these problem individuals appears effective at halting stock losses.	Namibia , Botswana , W & S Zimbabwe , S Mozambique , Swaziland , W Lesotho , and South Africa . Records from the SW of Angola are all before 1970.	https://zenodo.org/record/6350112/files/figure.png	Primarily a nocturnal animal, although activity is occasionally observed during the day, particularly on cool, cloudy days during the rainy season. There are typcally two peaks of activity, from 19:30 h to 24:00 h and 2:30 h to 6:00 h, with a rest period in between. Radio-collared adults in the southern Kalahari were active for 42.6% of the 24 h period, and 80.2% of the period between 18:00 h and 06:00 h. In Namibia , three males with satellite collars spent an average of 57-1-72-3% of 24 h active. Brown Hyenas typically rest during the day in a hole, or undera large tree or bush.

These animals drink regularly where wateris available, but they can also survive in many waterless areas. In North Africa they prefer open woodlands and bushy and mountainous regions. The central Arabian and Sahara Deserts are not suitable habitat. In central Asia, Striped Hyenas avoid high altitudes and dense thickets and forests. The maximum elevations recorded are 2250 m in Iran , 2500 m in India and 3300 m in Pakistan . In the Caucasus region, Turkmenistan , Tadzhikistan , and Uzbekistan , prime habitats include savannah and semi-desert regions up to an elevation of 2100 m , mountain areas with strong relief, valleys with abundant caves or other resting sites, and riverine areas. The Striped Hyena avoids areas with minimum temperatures ofless than —15°C to —20°C and more than 80-120 days offrost per year. In Israel , Striped Hyenas are present even close to dense human settlements. In West Africa, they occur in dry scrub savanna and Sahel woodland, particularly in the belt of Acacia raddiana woodland that extends from Senegal to Chad . In eastern Africa, Striped Hyenas are found in a variety of habitats ranging from open savanna to rugged, bush-covered mountain terrain.	The diet of Striped Hyenas apparently varies considerably from one part of their range to another, but these animals are clearly scavengers with catholic tastes. They are primarily carrion-eaters; their diet consists mainly of dried flesh and bones from carcasses of large vertebrates. They scavenge carrion and the remains of kills made by other predators, including Spotted Hyenas, Cheetahs, Leopards, Lions, and Tigers. The Hyena’s massive cheek teeth and supporting musculature easily permit the gnawing and breaking of bones, as well as the carapaces of tortoises and turtles. Striped Hyenas have also been reported to consume a wide variety of invertebrates, vegetables, fruit, garbage, and small vertebrates that the Hyenas hunt themselves. In central Kenya , analysis of bone fragments and hairs from fecal samples indicated that hyenas regularly consume small mammals and birds that are unlikely to be scavenged. The limited available diet data may underestimate the importance of active hunting in the lives of these animals. In various parts of eastern Africa, Striped Hyenas are reported to supplement their diet with Balanites fruits. The proportion of scavenged and killed prey items in the diet is still a matter of debate as there has been no detailed research on these Hyenas’ food intake. Some authors suggest that only individuals from the three larger subspecies, barbara, syriaca and hyaena , kill large prey, including livestock,as there is no evidence that the smaller subspecies, dubbah and sultana, attack large herbivores. In Turkmenistan the Striped Hyena has been reported feeding on Wild Boar, Kulan, porcupine, and particularly tortoises. In Uzbekhistan and Tadzhikistan , seasonal abundance of oil willow fruits (Eleagnus angustifolia) is reflected in the diet; in the Caucasus region the diet includes abundant grasshoppers. In Israel the Striped Hyena feeds on garbage, carrion, and fruits, particularly dates and melons. In eastern Jordan , the main sources of food are carcasses of feral horses and water buffalo and refuse from localvillages. The Striped Hyena can drink water of very variable quality, from fresh water to soda and salt water, but it may also satisfy its water requirements with melons or otherfruits. Very little is currently known about the hunting behavior of Striped Hyenas, but those few hunts that have been observed involved simple chases and grabs at prey. Seasonal influxes of Striped Hyenas follow migrations of large herds of domestic and wild ungulates in Turkmenistan , suggesting that the Hyenas cover long distances on foraging trips. In Egypt they are known to move along ancient caravan roads where the chance of locating dead camels is high. In Serengeti and in southern Kenya , they spend most of the night actively searching for food or moving between established foraging sites. Striped Hyenas apparently can remember the locations offruiting trees, garbage dumps and other established feeding sites, although the routes taken to re-visit such food sources are seldom repeated on consecutive foraging trips. They are also able to locate tortoises in their hiding places during periods of aestivation and hibernation. Striped Hyenas frequently cache bones or pieces of skin, using their snouts to push these items deep into clumps of grass or stands of dense shrubs. They may also carry food items back to their dens. Bone collections are common at den sites used by Striped Hyenas, although it is often unclear whether these collections represent scavenged or killed prey, and whether the bones collected play a significant nutritional role in the lives of these animals. Several studies have inferred diet by combining data from bone collections and fecal samples. In central Kenya , however, bone collections indicated a much broader range of prey than did scat analysis, and significant portions of bone assemblages were very old bones unlikely to represent material scavenged from fresh kills. From fecal analysis alone, several researchers have found remains of prey items that are more likely to have been scavenged than hunted, and larger mammals are represented far less often in the analysis of hairs in fecal material than would be expected based only on bone collections at dens. Striped Hyenas appear to be strictly solitary foragers, although multiple individuals occasionally gather at rich food sources such as large carcasses or refuse pits. These animals are sometimes found in small groups while resting, but there is no indication that they ever forage cooperatively. Genetic relatedness among members of groups seen feeding together has not been investigated. Foraging activity in Kenya and Tanzania is restricted to hours of darkness except during rain or unusually cloudy weather. Under those circumstances, Striped Hyenas may return to previously visited kills or carcasses, but do not embark on full foraging forays. In many areas, and for many centuries, Striped Hyenas have been described as raiding human graves and carrying away bones. Fruit and vegetable crop raiding by Striped Hyenas is currently considered a serious problem in some parts of Israel . While foraging, Striped Hyenas zigzag across the landscape and do not appear to follow set routes, even when returning to the same food source on multiple nights. Minimum mean distance travelled per night is 19 km at speeds of 2-4 km/h, occasionally trotting at speeds of up to 8 km /h, or running at a maximum of 50 km /h. Overall, the evidence indicates that Striped Hyenas are solitary foragers for which carrion, insects, fruits and vegetable matter represent significant portions of the diet.	The Striped Hyena has a very large range, covering much of Africa and western Asia. Although they do not occur in the central Sahara, these animals occur at low density in patches throughout eastern, western and northern Africa, including Algeria , Benin , Burkina Faso , Cameroon , Chad , Djibouti , Egypt , Ethiopia , Ghana , Kenya , Libya , Mali , Nigeria , Mauritania , Morocco , Niger , Senegal , Tanzania , and Tunisia . Striped Hyenas also occur in the Middle East and Central Asia. Middle Eastern and Asian countries included in the modern distribution of the Striped Hyena are Afghanistan , Armenia , Azerbaijan , Georgia , India , Iran , Iraq , Israel , Jordan , Lebanon , Nepal , Oman , Pakistan , Saudi Arabia , Tajikistan , Turkey , Turkmenistan , Uzbekistan , and Yemen . The current distribution of this species is patchy, and usually appears to occur in small, isolated populations.	https://zenodo.org/record/5676774/files/figure.png	The Striped Hyena is almost strictly nocturnal, although it does occasionally engage in some activity after dawn and before dusk. Some authorities suggest Striped Hyenas may be moststrictly nocturnal in areas characterized by relatively intensive anthropogenic activity, and where they are directly persecuted by humans.

In general these high-altitude grazing lands are low producing with annual production at 200-600 kg/ha for plains and mountainous zones and 600-2450 kg/ha for bofedales. The bofedal habitat is especially important for foraging Llamas during the dry season, yet fragile and susceptible to erosion if overgrazing is permitted.	[lamas are considered by their indigenous herders to be extremely hardy because of their ability to prosper in desolate-Andean environments. They have similar feeding habits to Alpacas, but distinct enough to make joint husbandry compatible and possible. Herders view the land andits forage as a single valuable unit because it feeds their Llamas and Alpacas. Land ownership is not important, but traditional use and designated rights to graze particular areas is critical. Studies in the highlands of Peru and Chile on the botanical composition of the diets of Llamas feeding on wet (bofedales) and dry (gramadales) meadows found a high overlap with Alpaca and sheep feeding habits, but significantly differed from Alpacas in the summer (61%) and winter (74%) because the two camelids were managed by herders to minimize competition. Llamas had higher digestion coefficients than sheep of organic matter, crude protein, dry matter, and fiber fractions of bunchgrasses, important forage for Llamas. These feeding trials comparing the abilities of Llamas vs domestic sheep in digesting organic material ofvarious qualities revealed the coefficients of digestibility for low quality to be 51 vs. 41 (24% difference between the species), medium quality 60 vs. 52 (15%), high quality 73 vs. 75 (-=3%), high fiber 58 vs. 52 (12%), medium fiber 62 vs. 58 (7%), and low fiber 67 vs. 65 (3%). Thus Llamas were significantly more efficient than sheep when forage was low to medium quality and high in fiber. Maintenance energy requirements for a 108 kg Llama is 2% of its body weight, or 2-2 kg dry matter of forage per day.			Daily activity patterns of Llamas are essentially the same as Alpacas. That is, after having spent the night in or next to a rudimentary stone corral adjacent to the family’s residence (often a single-room hut called “choza” made of stones with a thatched roof), the Llamas move out soon after sunrise to feed in the local highaltitude grasslands, moving and grazing often unattended by a herder, then return to the choza as darkness approaches. Activity budgets (percentage of time) of Llamas compared to sheep grazing on native Andean pasture dominated by favorable forage ( Festuca dolichophylla), have shown that all other activities were similar, but that Llamas feed more (71% vs. 57%) and rested less (15% vs. 25%) than sheep.

These combine to produce high evapo-transpiration and dry conditions that lead to low primary productivity. At a broad scale, Guanacos inhabit four of the ten major habitats found in South America: desert and xeric shrublands, montane and lowland grasslands, savannas and shrublands, and temperate forests, which botanically include the categories of Puna, pre-Puna, Andean steppe, Chacoan grasslands and shrublands, Espinal, and the southern Pampa. They inhabit flatlands, hilly foothills, and mountainous environments. In the arid habitats of southern Chile , isolated mesic subsystems were the preferred plant community accounting for 85% of female sightings and 60% ofterritorial males. These “vegas” (meadows) were not only preferred for their productive, higher-quality succulent forage, but for females a major influence for their selection was the avoidance ofsites and habitats favored by Pumas (Puma concolor).	The Guanaco is a non-specialized, opportunistic, intermediate, mixed-feeding herbivore, foraging on a wide variety of plants. It is basically a grazer, but also browses. When the availability of the herbaceous strata decreases or becomes unavailable, especially during winter, Guanacos feed mainly on the shrub or tree strata. This flexibility as a generalist to change diet according to availability or preference extends to eating epiphytes, lichens, fungi, cacti, succulent plants, fruit, flowers, and leaves. Their summer diet in a mixed habitat of southern Chile averaged 62% grasses (mainly Festuca ), 15% browse (Nothofagusspp.), and 11% forbs, which were particularly important in the spring. In another study on Tierra del Fuego their diet was made up of 90% grasses and forbs. In austral coastal forests of southern Chile , Guanaco browsing significantly diminishes the rate of regeneration of the commercially important southern beech tree (Nothofagus pumilio) and was a limiting factor on initial growth of seedlings and saplings (89% were browsed), although the Guanaco’s diet was less than 10% shrubs and trees. At Torres del Paine National Park, at the western edge of the Patagonia, vegas were highly utilized in summer (86% ofall feeding observations) and preferred by all feeding Guanacos (n = 1659) in family groups, whereas all other vegetation types were avoided (shrub = 3%, upland = 10%). Adult females in family groups showed the greatest feeding preference for vegas, followed by chulengos, yearlings, and adult males. In Argentine Patagonia, Guanaco densities are low and negatively related to domestic sheep numbers. Guanacos and sheep largely overlap in their forage preferences, with over 80% oftheir diets being identical. Histological analysis of fecal samples revealed that Guanacos and sheep were intermediate herbivores feeding on a wide range of grasses and forbs, capable of changing their diets seasonally, and their food niches greatly overlapped particularly in summer when food resources were more scarce than in spring.			Observations of both wild and captive Guanacos have shown peaks of eating, bedding, and ruminating in the morning and again later in the afternoon. Wild Guanacos spent a greater proportion of their time moving and less time resting, probably the result of the need to forage more and maintain intraspecific social interactions. At Torres del Paine during the summer, Guanacos in family groups in vega habitat fed 54% of time, rested 45%, and were involved in other behaviors 1% of the time (3084 focal observations). There was no difference in the activity-time budgets of 23 marked solo territorial males compared to family-group territorial males based on social group type, total number of females, total number of Guanacos present, or age of the ter ritorial males. The pattern suggested thatterritorial male behaviors were related to resource defense rather than to any direct ability to attract potential mates. Males, in all categories, spent most of their time foraging (65% of overall time budget). However, based upon habitat type there was a significant difference in time spent in aggressive and in miscellaneous activities (defecation, alertness to observer, scratching). Most aggressive encounters and miscellaneous activity occurred on hilltops of areas dominated by mata barrosa shrubs (Mulinum spinosum). Vigilance patterns were assessed in Chubut , Argentina for Guanacos occupying a tall shrubland covering 40-60% of the area, where 40% of the mortality was from Puma predation. Family group territorial males devoted more time to scanning their surroundings and less time feeding than did females, and both sexes benefited from grouping by reducing the time invested in vigilance and increasing foraging time. Males reduced the time invested in vigilance as the number of females in the group increased, while the presence of chulengos increased territorial male vigilance. However, in closed habitats collective vigilance increased with the number of adults but decreased with the number of chulengos. Although male and female Guanacos differed in their time allocation, results supported the hypothesis that both sexes received significant anti-predator benefits from group living. Adjustments in Guanaco body posture can modify the exposure of body surface area H—22%. Guanacos can decrease and increase body heat loss through radiation and convection by “closing” and “opening” their thermal windows in the axillary and flank regions. Researchers report that when ambient temperatures were 0-10°C, animals used postural adjustments to decrease the area of the thermal windows by 5-7% oftotal surface area. At temperatures greater than 10°C they increased the area of the thermal windows up to 22% to regulate heat loss through radiation and convection. When the temperature was below 0—1°C Guanacos bedded and huddled together, often with their hindquarters into the wind.	Baldi, Lichtenstein et al. (2008), Baldi, Pelliza-Sbriller et al.

The Puna ecosystem is rolling grassland and isolated wetlands typically at c.3500-5200 m altitude with two marked periods: the rainy season from October to April and the dry season from May to September. Most (75%) precipitation falls from November to March in the form of both hail and rain. In Peru the annual precipitation varies from 800 mm in the south to 1200 mm in the central mountains. The mean annual temperatures are less than 10°C and nocturnal frosts are common, especially during the dry season. Diurnal fluctuations can be as much as 20°C in the mesic Altiplano and even greater in the dry or desert Altiplano. The short growing season, as determined by moisture and night-time cloud cover, occurs between December and March. Vegetation is dominated by herbaceous grasses and forbs. Few trees exist and shrubs are only locally abundant. Perennial bunchgrasses are common including the genera Festuca , Poa , Stipa , and Calamagrostis , as well as the grass-like sedges Carex and Scirpus . High-quality forage is more abundant during the rainy season and scarcer during the remainder of the year. A critical habitat and principal source of forage for Alpacas in the Andes that allows intensive-localized foraging are bofedales or mojadales. Providing lush forage and moist vegetation that Alpacas thrive on, bofedales are localized islands of perennial greenery with deep organic soils moistened by subterranean and considerable surface water often forming small pools. Both natural and artificial bofedales exist, some man-made ones dating back to pre-Inca times. These high-altitude marsh areas can provide year-round forage, allowing herders and their animals to remain in the same area for extended periods. Depending upon water availability, they are productive only during the rainy season or throughout the year. As a result, their carrying capacity is highly variable, from 2-8 Alpacas/ha/year. Natural mojadales compared to irrigated artificial ones, typically have greater plant cover with more palatable and nutritious forage. Vegetative composition of bofedales in the humid Puna varies between several dominant species, including Distichia muscoides, Eleocharis albibracteata, Hypochoeris taraxacoides, Hidrocotilo ranunculoides, Liliaopsis andina, and others. A percentage cover of 64-72% of desirable species (Werneria nubigena, Werneria pymaea, Hipochoeris stenocephala, Ranunculos sp., Carex fragilaris) is excellent Alpaca forage. Reported total accumulated bofedal forage (dry weight) from January to August was 1021 kg /ha that grew at an average rate of 4-2 kg/ha/day. Protein ranged 8-3-13-4% and crude fiber 19-2-34-1%. Annual bofedal growth varies with season: 60% during the summer growing season (January-April), 21% during the transition to the dry season (May-June), and 19% in the dry season (July-December). Wet artificial bofedales have greater sustained productivity than natural bofedales with 10-11% protein in both the wet and dry seasons and capable of supporting 3—4 Alpaca/ha/year. Continuous year-round grazing of native grasslands is the most common grazing management practice used by indigenous herders, but technicians are encouraging enhancement of rangeland conditions through rotational grazing and reducing stocking rates of Alpacas and competing sheep. Recommended stocking rate for Alpacas on Andean native pastures is 2-7 animals/ha/year on excellent range, 2 good, 1 average, 0-33 poor, and 0-17 very poor. However, intensively managed, irrigated pastures of grasses and legumes at 3850 m altitude can support 25 Alpacas/ha/year. Research indicates that despite the high elevations and low night-time temperatures, it is possible to increase considerably the sustained carrying capacity of Andean rangeland by the introduction of improved forage species. Managed pastures of irrigated ryegrass ( Lolium perenne) and white clover (Trifolium repens) with application of nitrogen fertilizers can carry up to 30 adult ind/ha compared with the usual rate of 1-1-5 ind/ha on natural grasslands. On Andean rangelands grazed by Alpaca,tall grass communities are commonly set on fire during the dry season (June—October) by native indigenous herders. The objective is the destruction of bunch grasses that will encourage the growth of ground forage preferred by Alpaca and sheep. However, studies have shown that annual burns are not beneficial because they not only stimulate the rapid regrowth of bunchgrasses, but promote hillside soil erosion and encourage the growth of undesirable invasive plant species. Burning every third or more years during the wet season is a more effective approach for improving Alpaca range and habitat.	Historically, an Alpaca was considered to be equivalent to three sheep, but modern animal nutritionists in Peru consider that Alpacas consume 1-2—-1-5 times as much forage as one sheep. Alpacas are selective for these familiar Altiplano plants: Compositae/composites 31 4% (Hipochoires stenocephala, Werneria novigena), followed by Cyperaceae /sedges-rushes 26-1% ( Eleocharis albibracteata, Carexsp.), Gramineae /grasses 19-1% ( Calamagrostis rigescens, Festuca dolichophylla), Rosaceae /roses 14-6% ( Alchemilla pinnata, Alchemilla diplophylla) and minor percentages of Ranunculaceae / buttercups 5:6% ( Ranunculus breviscapus), Leguminosae/legumes 1-7% (Trifolium amabile) and others. Plant leaves,stalks, and flowers with protein content as high as 17-4% are selected by Alpaca when feeding in quality bofedales in the rainy-growing season. Year-round feeding studies on the chemical composition of ingested forage with fistulated Alpacas in Peru and Bolivia yielded the following: dry matter 9-9%, organic material 88-8%, minerals 11-2%, total protein 15-1%, ether extract 7-4%, crude fiber 27-5%, nitrogen-free extract 38-:8%, and detergent neutral fiber 61:6%. General apparent digestibility of bofedal nutrients was dry matter 64-9%, organic material 64-1%, and total protein 64-8%. Total digestible nutrients (TDN) of bofedal forage eaten by Alpacas was similar between the rainy (54-1%) and dry (66:5%) seasons, as was the average energy from TDN at 60-3%. Average daily weight gain per Alpaca grazed on typical (control) bofedales was 0-093 kg, but experimentally at low stocking rates (2 Alpaca/ha/year) weight gain was 0-101 kg/day, medium stocking (4 Alpaca) 0-084 kg/ day, and high stocking (6 Alpaca) 0-079 kg/day. Although the carrying capacity is around one Alpaca/ha/year, overgrazing occurs at 1-8-2-5 Alpaca/ha/year, lowering the quantity and quality of available forage. In indigenous Andean communities where herders own the animals but not the land and the communal grazing lands are used through permission from the community, overgrazing of the natural grasslands is not uncommon. Although efforts are being made to counter the situation, a long history of bofedal overuse by traditional Alpaca herders has frequently resulted in low live ( 50 kg ) and carcass (25-5 kg) weights, reduced fleece weights (1-2 kg), low fertility (35%), and high juvenile mortality (30%). Like Vicunas, Alpacas need frequent water intake. Water consumption by Alpacas grazing on bofedales was high during the dry season at 3-08 kg/animal/day and less in the rainy growing season at 2-04 kg. In another Peruvian study digestibility of high-altitude forage by Alpacas in both Altplano and bofedal habitats was lowest (50-62%) in the winter-dry season and highest (66-76%) in the spring/summer-wet season. Comparative feeding trials measuring the coefficients of digestibility revealed that when fed dry forage low in protein (less than 7-5%) Alpacas were 14% more efficient than sheep, but at high protein levels (greater than 10-5%), sheep were slightly (2%) more efficient. Other studies have reported that Alpacas have a digestion coefficient 25% higher than sheep, particularly on low-quality forage. Maintenance-energy requirements for a 60 kg Alpaca is 2% of its body weight, or 1-2 kg dry forage per day. Alpacas in Peru forage more selectively than Llamas. Diets are highest in grass during the wet and early dry season. As the dry season progresses, the diets of Alpacas in bofedal habitat became largely sedges and reeds (81%). Animals in dryer habitats consume more grass (68%). A study of live weight changes of Alpaca adult males, females, and their progeny, was conducted for three seasons under continuous grazing on natural grasslands on the Mediterranean range of Central Chile . Live weight changes were highest in spring (100-200 g/day), moderate during winter (50-100 g/day), and negative only at the end of summer and in autumn (-110 g/day to — 150 g /day). Weight gains of newborn Alpacas were greatest (110-150 g/day) in the first 90 days after birth and then decreased slightly, reaching values of 75 g /day at 8-5 months old. Weight gainsstabilized at 10-20 g/day at three years of age.			The daily routine or activity pattern of indigenous Alpaca family flocks is quite consistent. After having spent the night in a stone corral or next to the family house (usually a stone hut called a choza), the animals are released or move out on their own to graze for the day soon after sunrise. While the family’s sheep flock is tended by a herder, the Alpaca flock is not accompanied by a herder. Instead,its daily movements and activity patterns while grazing are self-directed within 1-2 km of their home base to local bofedales and other feeding areas of their choice. As sunset approaches, the flock returns to the home site by themselves without being escorted by a herder. Daytime activity budgets (percentage of time) of Alpacas compared to sheep while both species grazed on native-Andean pasture dominated by the favorable forage Festuca dolichophylla, have shown that while other activities were similar, Alpacas fed more (71% vs. 57%) and rested less (11% vs. 25%) than sheep.

Summer precipitation is typically in the form of rain or hail, rarely snow. It is a dry and cold environment with summer nights hovering close to freezing. Winter nights plummet well below freezing, 10-20°C below the daytime highs. Two distinct habitats with different levels of precipitation can be found within this dry-Andean ecosystem: the high-elevation moist or semi-humid high-Andean Puna and the lower elevation dry or semi-arid Puna habitat. The dry Puna is an extremely dry belt called the Andean Dry Diagonal, a north-west/south-east transition zone between two major hemispheric wind belts centered at the junction of north-west Argentina , south-west Bolivia , and north-east Chile . Within the Dry Diagonalthere is essentially no precipitation, no lakes, and no glacier formation. The distribution of subspecies vicugna is within the Dry Diagonal. Subspecies mensalis is found to the north of it. From a landscape perspective the Puna is characterized by peaks and pronounced slopes, the typical elevated plain that defines the region (Puna or Altiplano), and the intermediate piedmont fringes of smooth slopes. Vicunas use the habitats within the Puna and piedmont zones. The most common habitats in the Puna are xerophytic shrub steppes that are often mixed with an understory of sparse short grasses and forbs (typically not an important habitat for Vicunas); bunchgrass steppes (variable importance); open rocky areas with sparse vegetation (not important); short grass and forb areas on lower slopes, gentle slopes, and plains (important); and wetlands of short plants with high ground cover associated with high ground water, surface water, streams, and lagoons, regionally called bofedales, mojadales, and vegas (important). Bofedales (around 4500 m elevation in Peru ) are perennially green sedge communities typically dominated by Eleocharis albracteata and Carex ecuadorica with vegetative cover of ¢.22% grasses, 42% sedges and reeds, and 33% forbs, and a crude protein content of 12%. Short-grass forb areas on lowerslopes (around 3190 m in Peru ) are dominated by the grass species Festuca dolichophylla and Muhlenbergia fastigiata with a vegetative cover of 66% grass, 13% sedges and reeds, and 6% forbs, and a crude protein content of 10%.	As with other ungulate herbivores, Vicuna habitat and forage selection is based not only upon availability, but heavily influenced by climate (wet vs. dry years), population density (high vs. low), and the social status and ranking of individual animals (high vs. low). Thus for studies done at different locations, landscapes, and animal densities,it is not surprising to see variable results. For example in Peru at the Pampa Galeras National Reserve, Vicunas were observed to be strict grazers on grasses and forbs, whereas in Argentina at the Laguna Blanca National Park, Vicunas showed some diet plasticity by being grazers on grasses 16-19% ofthe time and browsers on shrubs 59-72% of the time with two grasses ( Panicum chlorolewcum and Distichlis spp-) representing nearly 50% of the diet. Feeding preference in productive habitats dominated by grasses has been documented in several areas of the Vicuna’s distribution. Of the two main habitats (grass steppe and vegas) at the Ulla-Ulla Vicuna Reserve in Bolivia , Vicunas preferred vegas. In the San Guillermo Biosphere Reserve of Argentina Vicunas were more abundant on the grassland plains. In Pampa Galeras National Reserve Vicunas preferred to forage in grass steppe communities characterized by Festuca nigesens or by Calamagrostis vicunarum, the latter being the dominant species in the vegetative type known as Excrement Influenced Vegetation (EIV). EIV is the result of long-term defecation-urination by Vicunas on dung piles; the resulting fertilization and accumulation of organic matter accelerates soil and plant succession over a long period of time. The third sere is an isolated “putting-green,” an island of short, abundant plants in rocky terrain downhill from a single or series of dung piles. The top soil is deeper and the plants grow thickly, close to the ground. EIV covered 18% of the total surface area of Pampa Galeras National Reserve, andits third sere had the highest productivity and was the most preferred forage vegetation. The general pattern of Vicuna habitat selection for grass-dominated communities, especially those of high nutritional value, is consistent with the results of diet studies that found Vicunas forage mainly on grasses ( Poaceae ) and grass-like sedges (Ciperaceae). When Vicunas coexisted with domestic livestock (sheep, goats, donkeys) in Argentina , they were spatially segregated, had a high overlap in diets, and used preferred habitatless than expected. The native Vicuna and exotic domestic animals coexisted because Vicunas were able to utilize suboptimal habitats while herders kept livestock in the richest habitats. A sympatric population of Vicunas and Guanacos in the San Guillermo Biosphere Reserve, Argentina , revealed that the diet of both species was similar, but Guanacos utilized more tall grasses and Vicuna fed more on forbs and short grasses.			During a year-round, 3-5yearfield study in Pampa Galeras National Reserve, home to a population of the northern subspecies mensalis, Vicuna family groups showed a predictable daily activity pattern in the large open valleys they occupied. Having spent the night on the upperflat ridges in small sleeping territories, within an hour after sunrise they moved as a group down to their daytime feeding territories. They spent the day on these lower slopes or flat plains, feeding at a constant rate. The sleeping territories, on higher ground, were warmer at night than feeding territories and were away from the streambeds where nocturnal predators hunted. The adult male Vicuna in the family group actively defended both territories by challenging and chasing away trespassing Vicunas. If human disturbance did not cause an early retreat back up the slope, the group returned to its sleeping territory in midto late afternoon. In the winter dry season, when small springs on the slopes dried up, groups left their feeding territory and moved to the center of the valley floor to drink from streams. Solo males holding a territory showed similar patterns. Male groups moved randomly and unpredictably through the area. In a separate study at Pampa Galeras National Reserve conducted during the March—-May breeding season, females spent significantly more time grazing than males (54 vs. 45 minutes/hour) and lactating females fed more than non-lactating females (56 vs. 53 minutes/hour). In general females fed 91% of the time; territorial males fed 75% of the time. In Salinas y Aguada Blanca National Reserve above Arequipa , Peru , there was a positive correlation between frequency of alert behavior per adult and the number of offspring in the family group, and at the Laguna de Pozuelos Biosphere Reserve in Argentina , solitary Vicunas spent more time standing and being vigilant and less time foraging than did members of groups. In Abra Pampa ( Argentina ), territorial males spent more time being vigilant and less time feeding as the size of their family group increased, but not more time in territorial defense (walking, running). At the Laguna Blanca Reserve in Argentina , which is extremely arid, daily activity patterns during the dry season were similar to the patterns of family groups at Pampa Galeras in the same season, with morning feeding on slopes, midday movement to a river on the flat, and a return to the slope and more feeding in the afternoon. At Pampa Galeras there was no significant difference between the amount of time males spent in territorial behavior and the number of female group members or the total group size. Studies at Laguna Blanca on the other subspecies, however, found a substantial decrease in amount of time males spent foraging when the number of females in their group increased.	Arzamendia et al.

They inhabit some of most inhospitable terrain in the world, centered in the extreme Gobi Desert of Central Asia. Gobi means “the rocky place” and it is primarily a rocky desert covered with small stones. There are low valleys and eroded hills, rocky-mountain massifs, “hamadas” (flat pavement-like stony plains), vast washed-out plains, high sand dunes, and rarely, poplarfringed oases. Summers are torrid, winters are cold. Annual precipitation is 50-200 mm. This is a region of extreme drought and scarce food and water. The Taklamankan Desert is sandy; Lop Nur Desert is both a rocky and sandy desert. Field studies in the Lop Nur Lake region of China revealed a Bactrian habitat preference for riparian communities and piedmont foothills; they were more often found in higher,hilly landscape than in the open. The Bactrians avoided gravel desert substrate and areas with hard, salt-crusted soil or moving sand dunes, preferring moderately hard ground. They stayed away from areas occupied by people. They used locations where the distance between foraging habitats and water sources did not exceed ¢.50-60 km and where there was relatively high coverage of halophytic vegetation, especially along lakeshores. In Mongolia preliminary results of satellite telemetry revealed a weak preference for habitat dominated by saxaul (Haloxylon ammodendrum) and no selection of areas with higher productivity or closer to permanent water sources. Climate change has altered Bactrian habitat by increasing the rate of desertification and reducing water resources and vegetation. Wild Bactrians have few native predators. Contrary to some accounts, Snow Leopards (Panthera uncia) pose no threat, and although Gray Wolf (Canis lupus) predation does occur,its impact is poorly understood.	Bactrians are opportunistic feeders capable of utilizing low-quality forage when more desirable herbage is unavailable. They are both grazers and browsers. Research on free-ranging domestic Bactrians in wild Bactrian habitat in the Gobi Desert provides the best information available on feeding habits. Those studies found that the camels’ main diet switched from senesced forbs in winter to a shrub in spring and to an increasing dependence on forbs in autumn. Although the shrub Haloxylon ammodendron was the dominant and highest biomass species in this desert community and a staple component of the camels’ diet each season, it was not preferred forage. Still, the shrub was essential when preferred forbs were not available in spring and summer. In autumn preferred annual forbs provided sufficient biomass. New plant growth during the wet season in summer and autumn was vitally important for replenishing the camels’ depleted fat reserves in preparation for winter. Domestic Bactrians are dependent on a year-long forage supply from the fragile and extremely arid environment they occupy. They show a preference for grazing on forbs, but are highly dependent upon browsing on shrubs. It has been reported that Bactrians can utilize salt water, with some researchers stating that salty water is necessary for their survival. When sufficient food is available in spring, summer, and autumn, Bactrians rarely have to drink, obtaining water requirements from plant moisture. In winter they have been observed to eat ice and snow.			Activity budgets are an indication of an animal’s welfare since its primary activities are centered on energy acquisition, conservation, or expenditure. Bactrian Camels are diurnal feeders and nocturnal sleepers. In winter they spend less time foraging and more time resting than in spring and summer. There is high foraging activity in spring, triggered by readily available shrubs with minimal walking required. Daily patterns of activity are structured to expend the least amount of energy to obtain food, even when the food is not preferred forage.	Adiya et al.

In Australia , Dromedaries favor bushy semi-arid lands and sand plains because of the availability of year-round forage, and avoid heavily vegetated and hard rocky areas.	Dromedaries are capable of surviving on poor-quality forage under arid conditions, aided by their ability to select high-quality plant species, increase digestion of low-quality forage, cover large distances while foraging, and diversify the nature of their diet by being both browsers (shrubs and trees) and grazers (forbs and grasses). In the Sahara browse and forbs make up 70% oftheir diet in winter and 90% in summer. Over 300 forage plants have been reported, with Acacia, Atriplex, and Salsola common in their diet. In Syria shrubs dominated the diet during the dry season, but camels switched mainly to herbaceous species with the onset of the wet season. In Australian deserts food intake by volume is 53% browse, 42% forbs, and 5% grasses. Dromedaries browse on trees and tall shrubs up to 3-5 m by grasping with their lips and either breaking off branches or stripping leaves. Under extreme cases of limited forage, the Dromedary can not only decrease its food intake, but also reduce its metabolic rate. Compared to sheep and cattle, Dromedaries require less energy for maintenance; their protein requirements are at least 30% lower than cattle, sheep, or goats. Feeding trials have revealed that Dromedaries utilized fed energy for maintenance with an efficiency of 73% comparable to sheep, and for growth with an efficiency of 61% better than sheep and cattle. The relationship of food intake to body size is low. They can live on only 2 kg of dry matter for limited periods, and 8-12 kg are sufficient for a working Dromedary carrying 130-227 kg load for six hours a day at a speed of 5 km /h for a 24day trip. When forage conditions are lush, camels tend to overeat for their immediate needs and store the excess energy in their humps. Dromedaries require six to eight times more salt than other animals, with 30% oftheir diet from halophytes (plants that tolerate and even require salty conditions). High salt intake is imperative for alimentary absorption of water by camels, with salt deficiencies leading to cramps and cutaneous necrosis. Although consumption of grain can cause indigestion in animals unaccustomed to it, working Dromedaries require 2 kg of grain per day.			Wild/feral populations exist only in Australia , where they show a daily pattern of feeding in the morning and afternoon hours and increased resting in the middle of the day. Midday resting is highest in winter. Elsewhere Dromedaries are domestic and intensely managed and regulated by traditional pastoral communities, often in conjunction with other livestock. In the Sahara, when they are allowed to roam without herders, they form stable groups of 2-20 animals. Dromedaries graze for 8-12 hours per day and then ruminate for an equal amount of time. When forage is especially poor they spread out over large areas and break up into units of 1-2 individuals. Guarded herds feed by day (lying down during the hottest hours) and rest by night, but unguarded, their activity pattern is reversed.

The forest types where the Bengal Slow Loris is found are probably even more variable, because the geographic range is so large, but the species remainslittle studied. It is known to occur close to agricultural fields and plantations but is usually found in habitats with interconnecting branches and vines up to 20 m above the ground. The Bengal Slow Loris occurs at elevations from sea level to 2400 m. Individuals tend to use large diameter and tall trees, with greater crown depths, and tend to avoid habitats with sparsely crowned trees.	Two of four recent studies found that gum is extremely important to the Bengal Slow Loris. Gum of Bauhinia ( Fabaceae ) lianas is commonly eaten in Thailand. In Tripura, India, gum is not a fallback food but preferred, because Bengal Slow Lorises feed on exudates 67-94% of the time, depending on the season. They also feed on nectar, fruit, bark, invertebrates, and bird eggs. They lick and scrape insects and gums off bark and also gouge holes to stimulate gum flow. In Cambodia, they eat leaves of Terminalia alata ( Combretaceae ), flying insects that they catch with one hand, and tree bark.

In Cambodia, they are significantly more active under little moonlight than during bright moonlight. This predator-rich environment was also more open, and individuals had to move across vulnerable habitat; lunar phobia is likely a valuable tactic to lorises in such a situation.

The Sunda Slow Loris can be found in forest edge among interconnecting branches and vines, up to 20 m above the ground. It also occurs in relatively urban areas, feeding near street lamps.	Diet of the Sunda Slow Loris includes mainly fruits, supplemented with leaves, shoots, saps, gums, flowers, seeds, bird eggs, and animal prey (including insects and the occasional bird). Its diet in Malaysia comprised five food types: floral nectar and nectar-producing parts mainly from flowers of the bertram palm (Eugeissona tristis, Arecaceae), phloem sap,fruits, gum, and arthropods. The largest proportion of feeding time was spent on phloem sap (34:9%), floral nectar and nectar-producing parts (31:7%), and fruits (22:5%). Sunda Slow Lorises gouge with their toothcomb to extract gum, excavating large holes in the wood of trees, and use their long tongues to lap it up. Their slow metabolic rate is linked to detoxifying toxic compounds in this plantrich diet.

The Pygmy Slow Loris can survive in highly degraded habitats. Flowering trees are most attractive to these animals.	The Pygmy Slow Loris is a faunivore-frugivore and specialized gum feeder. Consumption of saps and gums is similar to other lorises, and it is described here in detail for illustration. Pygmy Slow Lorises consume sap and gum from as low as 1 m to as high as 12 m off the ground. They perforate the superficial layer of the cambium of trees or lianas by scraping with their toothcomb. Lapping exposed sap with the tongue lasts from a few seconds to about four minutes, with intermittent additional breaking of the hard surface. Gum is consumed for a longer period, from two to 20 minutes, and involves gouging with anterior teeth. In most cases,trees already have wounds from larval infestation, prior injury, orfire, although lorises can also gouge into undamaged wood to induce gum flow. Lorises scoop up the gum, anchoring their upper incisors into the bark or into the solidified gum. In this manner, Pygmy Slow Lorises can also gouge into bamboo to find insects, and they appear to scrape lichens and fungus off the surface of old bamboo with their toothcomb. Until recently, no species of loris has been observed to gouge gum with its molars. Pygmy Slow Lorises in Cambodia eat “icicles” of gum exuded from open wounds, and while holding them in one hand, they alternately chew on them with their molars and lick them. Lorises search for their gum sources. Nosedown searching may accompany investigating for sap on branches, or searching along bamboo to find a location to gouge for insects. Visible and audible sniffing sometimes accompanies these searches. On gum trees without active wounds, Pygmy Slow Lorises race up and down a single trunk, making up to 20 trial holes before feeding. Trees with open wounds seem to be known to individual lorises; they make rapid and directed movement to a feeding site. When gouging begins, bark breaking can be audible to humans from a distance of 10 m. A loris may turn its head side to side while spitting out bits of bark; this side-to-side movementis often accompanied by scent marking of the wound with facial glands. Pymgy Slow Lorises consume bits of bark in this process. The more noisy process of gouging bamboo involves a loris anchoring its rear feet against the bamboo and bashing its toothcomb into the very hard surface; this behavior also results in shaking of the bamboo stand and is audible up to 100 m away. Pygmy Slow Lorises also eat flowers, geckos, small fruits, nectar, and numerous invertebrate prey.	Laos, Vietnam, and E Cambodia (E of the Mekong River), the precise W limit of the distribution is uncertain, but it appears to be absent (or at least very scarce) in the extreme W of the Mekong plain; records from S China (SE Yunnan Province) are uncertain and may be based merely on released captives brought in from elsewhere.	https://zenodo.org/record/6632679/files/figure.png	The Pygmy Slow Loris is nocturnal and arboreal. This supposedly slow climber moves rapidly on small branches from the ground to the highest point in the canopy. It makes use of long bamboo connectors to move across the arboreal pathway. During a radio-tracking study in Cambodia, the activity pattern of the Pygmy Slow Loris was 27% traveling, 22% alert, 20% sleeping, 5% feeding, 3% autogrooming, and 6% diverse, less common, behaviors; 17% of the records were unknown activities. Pygmy Slow Lorises only increased activity on bright moonlit nights as ambient temperatures increased, yet they were consistently active regardless of temperature on dark nights. The most plausible explanation for these patterns is the combined risk of predation (as a result of their anti-predator strategy) and heat loss on cool bright nights resulting in lunar phobic behaviors.

They move in a continuous and slow fashion using small branches on which they can maintain a grip with their shortened digits. They travel on the ground when they have to. Rapid movement is possible when threatened, but they also adopt a defense posture. An angwantibo will hunch its back and tuck its head between its arms. It will then thrust its back toward a predator with mouth open, confounding the predator that cannot detect which end is the head. In this way, the angwantibo can bite the predator from beneath its armpit.

Golden Angwantibos are sometimes found on farmland edges and plantations. Individuals spend much of their time in the tangled shrub layer. They tend to use branches and lianas of small size classes around which they can firmly clasp their hands and feet. They prefer dense forest that provides continuous walkways through the vegetation.	Diet is known from limited observations: analyses of stomach contents and controlled taste tests of wild animals in field conditions. The Golden Angwantibo is mainly insectivorous, consuming animal prey, especially caterpillars and other noxious prey ignored by the up to five sympatric nocturnal primate species with which it might occur. Insects are supplemented with fruits and gums. In Gabon, 85% of the diet was insects, 14% fruit, and 1% wood fiber, with the most common prey being caterpillars (65%) and beetles (20%). The Golden Angwantibo often forages in the undergrowth below a height of 5 m but occasionally to 15 m. It sometimes feeds on the ground, probably using scent and olfaction. Angwantibos hold caterpillars by the head with their mouth and wipe their hands along the caterpillar’s body, for up to 20 seconds, to removeirritating hairs. Captive angwantibos have refused fruit but have accepted all insect species offered to them.

Like the Calabar Angwantibo, it adopts a threat posture when disturbed. Guard hairs on the back allow an individual to feel its environment and also probably allow it to detect predators or dangers on conspicuous parts ofits body. If disturbed in a tree, the Golden Angwantibo may roll into a ball and fall to the ground or a lower branch. It relies on small branches that it can clasp, giving it a sense of security.

The West African Potto is sometimes found in farms, plantations, and wooded savanna. It commonly moves in the midto upper canopy, 10-20 m or more from the ground. The type specimen of the Mount Kenya Potto was found in montane forest at 1830 m above sea level.	There is no specific information for this species, but it probably eats animal prey, fruit, and gum.			The West African Potto is nocturnal, arboreal, and slow-climbing, but it is capable of swift continuous movement. It moves in the canopy at 5-30 m on medium-sized oblique branches. Basal metabolic rate (36-40 kcal/day/kg “7) is about one-half that expected for a mammal of its size. The potto has a larger brain than predicted from its low metabolic rate. When faced with predators, all species of pottos are equipped with three physical adaptations that make them a formidable adversary: a scapular shield produced by a combination of raised apophyseal cervical spines, some of which protrude above the skin in the form of tubercles, covered by thick skin and bristles of sensory hair, that offers protection, defense, and acute sensitivity; muscular hands that allow the potto to firmly grip a substrate without falling off (a potto can support up to 15 times its weight); and the retia mirabilia of the proximal limbs, a dense web of blood vessels that allow stillness for extended periods. The potto first faces a predator uttering a series of grunts, open-mouthed, and butting with the shield. If it fails to dislodge the predator, the potto simply drops to the ground, moves rapidly through the undergrowth and disappears to safety. Low vertebral spines of the thorax may increase flexibility allowing a potto to twist serpentine-like through the canopy. Such movements enable pottos to bridge gaps and search for food while remaining suspended in one spot.	Bearder & Pitts (1987), Bearder et al. (2003), Bender & Chu (1963), Buckanoff et al.

They engage in a nose-down foraging posture to lick up ants, other invertebrates, and gum from bark. Insects, presumably beetles and their larvae, may be scavenged from oil palms Elaeis guineensis ( Arecaceae ). Other prey includes giant West African land snails ( Achatina achatina ), moths, ants, beetles, beetle larvae, caterpillars, locusts, grasshoppers, spiders, millipedes, centipedes, slugs, frogs, bird eggs, small birds, and young bats. During dry periods, gum seems to become more important in some areas and can comprise 60% of the diet.

It occupies the understory in dry forests and the canopy in wetter areas. It can persist in home gardens, tea plantations, and hotel grounds, where it probably lives mainly on insects. Gray Slender Lorises move at heights of 2-5 m, depending on their habitat. They move in a serpentine fashion, from ground to canopy, and also cross gaps of open ground, including roads and paddy fields.	Faunivorous, consuming mainly invertebrates (including ants and mollusks), along with bird eggs, nestlings, geckos, birds, tree frogs, small mammals, unripened fruits, young leaves, and gum. In the only detailed long-term study of the species’ diet, 96% ofall feeding events focused on animal prey, the majority of which were ants and termites. In addition to spiders, mollusks, and lizards, other key insect orders in the diet include: Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, Orthoptera, Odonata, Hemiptera, and Diptera. Lorises are able to eat insects with high levels of secondary compounds, accompanied by pre-ingestive urine washing, or slobbering and urine washing during ingestion. Gray Slender Lorises are terminal branch specialists that catch their prey visually with one or two hands, and they use acrobatic postures in the more dangerous and swaying branches. Lorises infrequently feed on gums and legume pods, but they can make holes in bark through active gouging. Observations of the Sri Lankan forms are in accordance with those of longer-term studies in India. The Northern Ceylon Slender Loris was observed to eat only insect or animal prey, including lizards and snails. They nearly always detect their prey with their eyes and engage in acrobatic suspensory postures to catch their prey items. They grasp the prey with one or two hands, and prey items are rarely caught and eaten directly with the mouth. Northern Ceylon Slender Lorises do not appear to eat gum or drink water, and the only non-insect item they appear to eat is nectar from a flowering Cassia roxburghii ( Fabaceae ). In captivity, the Highland Slender Loris feeds on tree frogs, geckos, and large insects.			The Gray Slender Loris is nocturnal and arboreal, and it moves quadrupedally in trees. Although it can move slowly when threatened,it is generally silent and swift. It prefers to move on the top of branches. Gaps between branches are crossed by using horizontal bridging, whereby hindlimbs hold on to a substrate while forelimbs grab for the desired branch. Three limbs are usually holding a support branch when moving in a quadrupedal fashion. The Gray Slender Loris is capable of rapidly scaling a large tree trunk or scampering along other large substrates, although it prefers small supports that it can clasp firmly in its hands. It crosses roads and agricultural fields when necessary.	Christie (1992), Devaraj Sarkar et al.

The subspecies tardigradus is found in the wet lowland forests up to 470 m above sea level. Its habitat is heavily fragmented. It uses small twigs, lianas, and vines for movement, and it also forage on the ground. The Horton Plains Slender Loris is found in central Sri Lanka at elevations of 1800-2300 m in montane mist forests. It has been observed moving on the ground and crossing roads, and it is often seen low down in stunted vegetation. Vicinity to human populations negatively impacts the Red Slender Loris ; it is rarely found in home gardens and seems to require continuous canopy to move between forest patches.	In 1905,|. Still suggested that lorises were completely insectivorous, even carnivorous. Wild Red Slender Lorises have only been seen eating animal prey. They eat insects (including moths, stick insects, dragonflies, beetles, cockroaches, and grasshoppers), lizards ( Calotes , Agamidae ), and geckos. They have not been seen eating birds, but the speed with which they can grasp prey and kill with a bite to the head suggests this is possible. At Masmullah Proposed Forest Reserve, lorises were found in high abundance in areas with Humboldtia laurifolia ( Fabaceae ), a tree that has a mutualistic relationship with ants and provides abundant food for lorises. Nothing is known of the diet of the Horton Plains Slender Loris .			The Red Slender Loris is nocturnal and arboreal. Although lorises are thought to be slow climbers, kinematic studies revealed that the nominate subspecies tardigradus can move at speeds of 1-3 m/second. In a secondary tree-fall area, Red Slender Lorises are small-branch specialists, most often moving on supports less than 5 cm in diameter and only occasionally selecting branch clusters or substrates larger than 5 cm in diameter. Overall, they do not have strong preferences with respect to branch orientation. Rapid quadrupedalism is used on arboreal supports of all diameters and orientations, but individuals have never been seen moving on the ground. The Horton Plains Slender Loris moves very much like its low-country counterpart and is also capable of incredible speed. It has been observed at low heights (2 m above the ground), and it crosses open ground. It also will occur in the highest trees available, for example, in alpine scrub at heights of 4 m.

The species commonly inhabits tropical lowland South American moist and swamp forests, but also can be found in a wide range of other habitat types, including xeric Chaco and Cerrado forest, savanna wetlands, and lower montane forests, at elevations up to 2000 m . There are six main habitat categories where Lowland Tapirs can be found: tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests; tropical and subtropical moist to seasonally moist montane forests; tropical and subtropical dry forests, savannas, and shrublands; tropical and subtropical seasonally moist grasslands and savannas; montane grasslands; and mangroves. During a long-term Lowland Tapir field study in the Atlantic Forests of Morro do Diabo State Park, Sao Paulo , Brazil , tapirs strongly selected riparian environments and marshes, where they performed most of their main activities, particularly foraging. They avoided areas of agriculture and pasture land, as well as secondary growth forests. Palm forests are known to be important habitats, and they also frequent saltlicks, particularly in the Amazon. In the north-eastern region of the Brazilian Pantanal, tapirs show high preference for Acuri palm (Scheelea phalerata) forests. In the semi-deciduous Atlantic Forest, they prefer areas ofJeriva palm ( Syagrus romanzoffiana ) forests. The Jeriva is the most abundant and widespread palm species in the semi-deciduous Atlantic Forest. In the Amazon, patches of moriche palm (Mauritiaflexuosa) are used intensively by tapirs. During the study in Morro do Diabo State Park, tapirs moved fairly easily through areas of non-habitat between patches of forest. These pathways included pastures and croplands, especially sugar cane, soy bean, and corn plantations. In some instances, tapirs crossed areas of forest regeneration, degraded forest corridors, and riparian forests along small rivers. Lowland Tapirs also cross eucalyptus plantations between fragments of Atlantic Forest in Espirito Santo State , Brazil .	Due to their diet and stomach anatomy, Lowland Tapirs are closer to the browser side of the grazer-browser-frugivore continuum. There is some geographic variation in the composition of their diet. In the Peruvian Amazon, the species consumes 33% fruit and 66% leaf and fiber. The diet of Lowland Tapirs in the semideciduous Atlantic Forest consists of 37% fruit and 63% leaf and fiber. In the tropical rainforests of French Guiana their diet comprised 24-4% fruit, 22-3% leaf, and 53-2% fiber. In the Bolivian Chaco, the diet was 16-8% fruit, 62% leaf, and 21-2 % fiber. Tapirs selectively browse vegetative parts of different food plants. More than 170 species of fruits in over 60 different plant families have been identified as eaten by Lowland Tapirs throughout their range. In the Peruvian Amazon, they consumed 122 species of fruit from 33 plant families, and in the semi-deciduous Atlantic Forests of Brazil , they consumed 58 species of fruit from 23 plant families. Palm fruits are among the most important food resources, especially during the dry season when other species of fruit are less available. Mauritiaflexuosa is the single most important food item (76%) in the diet of Lowland Tapirs in the Peruvian Amazon. The distribution of these palm patches appears to strongly influence the movement patterns of tapirs in the area. In addition, tapirs are efficient dispersers of Mauritia flexuosa seeds. In Morro do Diabo State Park, Brazil , Syagrus romanzoffiana was the most frequently found fruit (18:4%) in Lowland Tapir fecal samples. In the Bolivian Chaco, Lowland Tapirs have successfully adapted to seasonal droughts, and to diets that include a large proportion of cactus fiber.			Tapirs are predominantly nocturnal and crepuscular. Lowland Tapir rest during the day and begin their activity after sunset, at around 18:00 h. In the semi-deciduous Atlantic Forests of Morro do Diabo State Park in Brazil , their main periods of activity are from 19:00 h to 00:00 h, with a peak between 20:00 h and 21:00 h (63% active); and from 01:00 h to 07:00 h, with a peak between 05:00 h and 06:00 h (60% active). Tapirs in Morro do Diabo are largely inactive between 11:00 h and 16:00 h. Overall, tapirs in Morro do Diabo foraged for approximately five hours in the early evening, and then seemed to rest for a few hours in the middle of the night. There followed a second foraging bout, of approximately six hours in the early hours of the day. Tapir activity patterns were analyzed separately for wet and dry season, as well for both sexes and different age classes in Morro do Diabo, and were fairly consistent. In Kaa-Iya del Gran Chaco National Park, Bolivia , tapirs are mostly active between 18:00 h and 22:00 h, and between 00:00 h and 06:00 h, with a main activity peak between 01:00 h and 06:30 h, and very little activity between 11:00 h and 15:30 h. In the Peruvian Amazon, tapir activity peaks were observed between 19:00 h and 20:00 h and between 03:00 h and 04:00 h, with the main foraging time between 21:00 h and 03:00 h. Nocturnal line-transect sampling in Morro do Diabo State Park allowed for an analysis of the effect of moonlight intensity on tapir activity. Approximately 47% of the tapir encounters occurred during the waning crescent, 21% during the new moon, 18% during the waxing crescent, and only 14% during the full moon. It was clear that tapirs in Morro do Diabo were considerably less active during the brighter phases of the moon. Previous studies suggested that a lower level of animal activity during moonlit nights is a result of higher predation risk. In El Rey National Park, Argentina , tapirs were typically diurnal, perhaps due to lack of human disturbance.	Affonso (1998), Aquino et al.

The speciesis strongly associated with water and is found in marsh and swamp areas, mangroves, wet tropical rainforest, riparian woodland, monsoon deciduous forest, dry deciduous forest, montane cloud forest and paramos. Overall, Central American Tapirs prefer habitat types with permanent water bodies, diverse and dense understory, riparian vegetation, low incidence offires, and less hunting pressure and human presence. Some studies in Mexico have noted that Central American Tapirs prefer densely forested areas rather than open, more disturbed habitats. In the mixed deciduous forest of Santa Rosa National Park in the north-west of Costa Rica , the tapirs relied on small pools of water in dried-up riverbeds for their drinking and wallowing requirements. Much of the habitat there was subclimax forest. In Corcovado National Park, also in Costa Rica , tapir sign (tracks, dung, rubbings, and evidence of foraging) was more abundant in lowland, second-growth forests and palm swamps than mature forests. In fact, tapirs in Corcovado strongly selected secondary forests and avoided mature forests. Seasonal variations in habitat selection correlated with fruit availability were observed. Tapir sign in Corcovado showed positive correlation with distance from perennial water bodies and rain intensity; there was a negative correlation between sign and slope steepness. Central American Tapirs have been observed in the Costa Rican paramos, particularly near ponds surrounded by dense bush of Chusquea . Lacking a dense hair coat like that of the Mountain Tapir, an extraordinarily thick skin and subcutaneous fat deposits probably help Central American Tapirs withstand the low temperatures prevailing in the paramos. In La Sepultura Biosphere Reserve, Mexico , tapir sign has been observed along mountain crests at 1000-1500 m. These mountain crests are often covered by strips of oak forest, which are believed to be used by tapirs as both marking sites and transit areas between tropical subdeciduous and montane cloud forest slopes.	The Central American Tapir selectively consumes a wide array of fruit, leaves, shoots, bark, and flowers. Long-term direct observations of one Central American Tapir in Corcovado National Park, Costa Rica , revealed that these animals consume an average of 15-63 kg of fruit and fibrous materials per day. The tapir observed consumed 126 different plant species. The percentages of bites taken of each food item during the study were 67% leaves, 18:6% fruits, 11-7% stems, 2-1% bark, and 0-1% flowers. Three species accounted for 40% ofthe tapir’s bites for the entire study. The information available on feeding habits of Central American Tapirs in Mexico comes from a few studies in which about 98 plant species of 50 families were recorded as consumed by this ungulate. The plant families most frequently represented in the diet of Central American Tapirs in Mexico are Asteraceae , Fabaceae , Moraceae , Rubiaceae , and Solanaceae . A previous study carried out in a tropical lowland forest in Guatemala noted that 49 species of plants are consumed by tapirs, with three species representing the highest percentage of the diet. Asteraceae , Euphorbiaceae , and Rubiaceae were the most important plant families. In the lowland rainforests of Corcovado National Park, plant species of the families Arecaceae , Euphorbiaceae , Moraceae , and Rubiaceae accounted for 33% of total plant species in the tapirs’ diet. Asteraceae , Ericaceae , and Poaceae (especially Chusquea subtessellata ) seem to be the predominant plant families in the 3000 m high paramos of Chirripé National Park, Costa Rica . The most evident changes in proportions of food items ingested by Central American Tapirs throughout the year are those related to fruit consumption. Fruit usually constitutes a smaller proportion of the diet of Central American Tapirs compared to leaves and other fiber sources. Average fruit proportions found in their feces generally ranges from 7-1% to 18:6% in different areas. However, in Santa Rosa National Park, Costa Rica , some fecal samples consisted almost entirely of fruit pieces and tapirs there depended heavily on a wide range offruits (and fruit sizes) during the dry season. Fruit provides significant amounts of the nutrition and calories consumed by this ungulate. Palm swamps composed primarily of Raphia taedigera and Bactris balanoidea are regularly patrolled by the tapirs and other ungulates, White-lipped Peccaries (7ayassu pecari) in particular, in search of fruit. The role of Central American Tapirs in seed dispersal and seed predation is not completely understood but studies in Santa Rosa demonstrated that they widely dispersed viable seeds of many species in their dung, including seeds incidentally ingested while browsing. In Guatemala and Mexico , Central American Tapirs appear to be important dispersers of Manilkara zapota seeds.	SE Mexico to NW Colombia ; formerly also W Ecuador S to Gulf of Guayaquil, but their occurrence there is now uncertain.	https://zenodo.org/record/5721167/files/figure.png	Central American Tapirs are substantially more active nocturnally than during the day. Their main peaks of activity are between 19:00 h and 20:00 h and 03:00 h and 04:00 h. In Santa Rosa National Park, tapirs were often active for short periods during the day, particularly in the dry season, when they entered residual pools in riverbeds to rest. However, tapirs are known to become almost completely nocturnal when there is heavy hunting pressure.	Barongi (1986, 1993), Bolanos & Naranjo (2001), Brooks et al. (1997), Carrillo et al.

In the Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary in Thailand tapirs range from 100 m to 1500 m in alttude, and in Sumatra, tapirs may reach an altitude of 1500 m , or possibly 2000 m when crossing a ridge. They are not found in northern Myanmar , northern Thailand , Laos , Vietnam , and Cambodia ,likely because of the more seasonal climate and harsher dry season of the forest in these areas. In Thailand , tapirs are associated with a variety of forest types including dry dipterocarp, mixed deciduous, dry evergreen, and hill evergreen. Tapirs move into evergreen forest during the dry season when food is scarce and forestfires are present. They return to the dry dipterocarp and mixed deciduous forest in the rainy season when sprouts of leaves and twigs emerge. Although Malayan Tapirs are generally considered to be lowland animals, they do travel a long way up mountains. In Indonesia , they inhabit lowland areas during the dry season and move to mountain areas during the wet season. Because the lowland forests are disappearing at a faster rate than the montane forests, an accelerated reduction in range and population is suspected. The Malayan Tapir habitat in Indonesia has been described as humid, swampy, densejungle with an understory of shrubby plants and grassy meadows bordering streams. In southern Sumatra , researchers found the highest densities of tapirs in undisturbed swamp areas and lowland forests on well-drained soil. The same researchers further stated that tapir densities were lower in early-stage successional forest than in late-stage successional forest that was formerly logged. Similarly, in the Jambi Province of southern Sumatra , a study showed that undisturbed areas were preferred over disturbed areas; however, signs of their presence were abundant in forest fringes as well as logged or otherwise disturbed forest, and sometimes these animals wandered into rubber and oil palm plantations. In Bengkulu , Sumatra , tapirs are considered to be a problem species for stripping bark from rubber trees. The Malaysian Department of Wildlife and National Parks (DWNP) inventories show that Malayan Tapirs are found within a 5 km radius of major cities like Seremban, Kuantan, and Temerloh. Another important aspect of their habitat use is that saltlicks apparently are visited once or twice a month, preferably with the new and the full moon. Malayan Tapirs generally stay in the vicinity of water. They like to spend a considerable time in the water and often defecate there. Several individuals have been rescued after falling into village wells or getting stuck in mud wallows.	Malayan Tapirs are selective browsers, concentrating their diet on young leaves and growing twigs. Preferred food plants mostly (42%) belong to the plant families Euphorbiaceae and Rubiaceae . Most of the plants consumed are woody and only a few herbaceous plants are consumed. In addition to foliage, Malayan Tapirs consume considerable amounts of fruit that they pick up from the ground. During feeding they sometimes push over small trees and break smaller sapling stems and branches in orderto get to the leaves and twigs. The heights at which they break stems were found to range between 0-8 m and 1-4 m. Feeding is not concentrated in particular locations. Suitable leaves and fruits appear to be eaten as encountered. Whereasit was reported by one source that their preferred food plants are characteristic of forest fringe and secondary growth, another source stated that the only feeding signs were found on understory plants in the primary rainforest. More than 115 species of plants are known to be eaten by Malayan Tapirs. Approximately 75% of these plants comprised 27 species and these are considered to be the most highly preferred food items. In Thailand , 39 species of plants were preferred. Their diet comprised 86-5% leaves, 8:1% fruit, and 5-4% leaf/twig matter. The most common plant species consumed by Malayan Tapirs in Sumatra are Symplocos, and Asplenium, Artocarpus , and Durio are occasionally eaten in secondary forests. Some herbaceous plants (Curculigo latifolia) and low-growing succulents (Homalomena and Phyllagathis rotundifolia) are also consumed, as is club moss (Selaginella willdenonii). The saplings of Baccaurea parviflora are browsed heavily.	Malayan Tapirs occur in two disjunct and isolated populations, one on mainland SE Asia in peninsular Malaysia , Thailand , and Myanmar , and the other in the S & C Sumatra , in Indonesia .	https://zenodo.org/record/5721173/files/figure.png	A Malayan Tapir camera-trap study in Way Kambas National Park, Sumatra , Indonesia , found the tapirs to be strictly nocturnal, with an activity pattern that peaks at 19:00 h, when their only possible predator, the Sumatran Tiger, is least active. A more recent camera-trap study in the Taratak village, West Sumatra , noted an activity peak at 22:00 h. Tapirs studied in Taman Negara in Malaysia were observed to browse occasionally during the daytime hours but were mostly encountered atrest.

Mountain Tapirs rarely use open habitats (pampas), in spite of the considerable quantity and quality of food available. In Los Nevados National Park, Colombia , Mountain Tapirs selected secondary forests, avoided paramos and ecotones, and showed no preference for or against mature forests. Their density in secondary forests was higher than in mature forest, ecotones, and paramos. Bedding sites are frequently encountered in forest thickets. In areas with cattle, the tapirs tend to be found on steep, forested mountain slopes inaccessible to cattle.	Mountain Tapirs are classified as selective browsers according to their craniodental patterns and dental morphology. The Mountain Tapir diet includes a variety of understory plant species including herbs, grasses, shrubs, fruits and berries, twigs, and a predominance ofleaves. A field study in Ecuador showed that of 28 plant families, Asteraceae ranked highest in the number of different species eaten, followed in diminishing order by Gramineae , Rosaceae , Cyperaceae , Fabaceae , Scrophulareaceae, and Valerianaceae . The same study indicated that Mountain Tapirs select certain favored plants regardless of their relative abundance. Flower parts were noted in five out of 37 fecal samples. A more recentfield study in Colombia showed that a total of 109 species of plants were consumed, and 45 of them were strongly selected. Mountain Tapirs consumed 54% woody species, 30% herbs, and 16% grasses. Once again, Asteraceae was the most frequent family in the Mountain Tapir diet. Patches of Chusquea make up a high proportion of secondary forest vegetation in Los Nevados National Park and make up a large part of the tapirs’ diet. The Mountain Tapir uses the sensitive bristles on the tip of its proboscis, as well as its senses of smell, taste, and, to a lesser degree,sight in selecting palatable items. Like other tropical species living in areas of high rainfall, the Mountain Tapir depends upon supplementary mineral intake from mineral seeps and natural saltlicks. Additionally, Mountain Tapir occasionally eat certain types of clayish mud, according to native Puruhaes Indians.	The species is known to occur in the Andean areas of Colombia , Ecuador , and N Peru ; historically also in W Venezuela , but now extirpated.	https://zenodo.org/record/5721169/files/figure.png	Daily activity of Mountain Tapirs in Los Nevados National Park, Colombia , was clearly bimodal, with peaks in the early hours of the day (05:00-07:00 h) and early hours of the evening (18:00-20:00 h). In the cloud forests and wet paramos of Ecuador , the activity of a young Mountain Tapir was higher during the morning (07:00-09:00 h) and late afternoon /evening (15:00-21:00 h). Increased nocturnal activity may be witnessed in areas with a greater presence of humans and livestock. In Colombia ,it has been hypothesized that the Mountain Tapir is more active at higher elevations (i.e. paramos and the upper limit of montane forests) during the dry season; during the wet season, activity increases at lower elevations. Apparently, domestic livestock management activities during the dry season at lower elevations forces the tapirs to move to paramos. A camera-trap study carried out in Los Nevados National Park revealed higher Mountain Tapir nighttime activity along trails and at a natural lick during the full moon.	Acosta et al.

Annual ice adjacent to coastlines (shore fast ice) regularly fractures, providing open leads where seals can breathe. The seasonal fluctuations between freezing and open water also promotes high productivity of fish, the prey of seals. Thus, this habitat is preferred by seals, and is consequently a favored habitat for Polar Bears, which hunt seals along the ice cracks and edges. Polar Bears also hunt from large chunks of drifting ice, and to a lesser extent, multiannual pack ice, where seal density is lower and access to seals more difficult. For this reason, density of Polar Bearsis low close to the North Pole. In summer, when the ice retreats, bears either migrate northward or use nearshore terrestrial habitats. Parturient females stay ashore to den and give birth. In Hudson Bay ( Canada ) they den 10-80 km inland in peat banks; elsewhere maternity dens are typically in snow caves along coastal areas. However, in the Beaufort Sea, half the pregnant females den on drifting sea ice. Non-pregnant bears do not hibernate, but do use shelter dens. At lower latitudes, they use shelters on land during ice-free periods to escape heat and conserve energy when precluded from hunting seals; at high latitudes (above 75° N ) they seek shelters on thick sea ice during winter, when foraging is most difficult and weather conditions harshest.	Almoststrictly carnivorous, preying mainly on young Ringed Seals (Pusa hispida), to a lesser extent Bearded Seals (Erignathus barbatus), and in some areas, Harp Seals (Pagophilus groenlandicus). The principal focus on Ringed Seals is evident in the close association between Polar Bear density and Ringed Seal density, and in the unique behavior of these seals, which give birth in subnivian lairs as an anti-predation strategy. One study found that an average Polar Bear consumes fewer than 50 Ringed Seals a year, 80% being pups caught either in their lairs or shortly after emerging from their lairs. Polar Bears also occasionally prey on other marine mammals, such as Walruses (Odobenus rosmarus), and Beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) whales. These large prey, including Bearded Seals (which are much larger than Ringed Seals), are taken mainly by adult male bears. When ashore, depending on availability, Polar Bears have been observed to prey on Reindeer (Rangifer tarandus), seabirds, or fish; and eat carrion (dead whales), berries, vegetation, and human garbage.	Arctic Ocean: Canada , USA ( Alaska ), Greenland , Norway ( Svalbard ), Russia . Have been sighted within 0-5° of North Pole.	https://zenodo.org/record/5714511/files/figure.png	Appear to be mainly diurnal. Seasonal changes in activity vary regionally with dynamics of sea ice and abundance of prey. Activity, measured by percent of time active and distance moved,is elevated when seal pups are particularly naive and vulnerable to predation, and when older seals are molting and basking on the ice. In contrast to other predators, Polar Bears are most active when prey is most abundant. They become hyperphagic, and are able to store fat to withstand extended periods when foraging is more difficult, such as during the winter on the pack ice. Periods of rapid annual ice formation and ablation, during summer and fall, also result in greater activity. Parturient females den for about six months (mid-September to mid-March in most areas); non-pregnant Polar Bears do not hibernate.	Amstrup (2003), Amstrup & Gardner (1994), Amstrup et al.

Their range overlaps that of both the American and Asiatic Black Bear, and also slightly that of the Polar Bear. They exist at elevations from sea level (temperate rainforests and Arctic tundra) to well above treeline (dry Asian steppes); highest elevation sightings (tracks in snow) have been at 5500 m (possibly 5800 m ) in the Himalayas, and highest latitude sightings at 74° N ( Canada ), well into Polar Bear range.	Food habits vary regionally from principally herbivorous to principally carnivorous, depending on habitat. Plant foods include grasses, sedges, horsetails, forbs, roots, berries, and nuts. Animal foods include insects, rodents, ungulates, and fish. Insects are a significant dietary component in broadleaved forests of Europe, rodents and ungulates are most important in Arctic and alpine areas and some Boreal forests, and fish are paramount along the Pacific Coast, from British Columbia to Alaska to Kamchatka ( Russia ). Herbaceous vegetation tends to be the chief component of the spring diet. Later the bears switch to roots, berries, pine nuts, acorns, ants, bees, moths, ground squirrels, marmots, pikas, neonate ungulates, or spawning salmon, depending on availability. This species is morphologically and behaviorally well adapted to digging up insects and underground rodents,killing ungulates (including domestic species, like sheep and cattle), and catching salmon. In North America they rarely climb trees, whereas in Europe and parts of Asia they do so more regularly.			Active diurnally in North America, except where human activity is high. Nocturnally active in most of Europe, possibly due to more frequent contact with humans, both historically and presently. Young bears in Europe are active uniformly through the day, but apparently learn to become more nocturnal through negative experiences with people. Total time active per day (40-80%) varies with local conditions (food, day length). The period of hibernation also varies regionally: at the northern extremes of their range they may hibernate for seven months (October-May); conversely, on Kodiak Island, Alaska, where winters are mild and some food may remain available, about one-quarter of the males do not den all winter, an unusual anomaly among Brown Bears. In Russia , following seasons with very poor food, large numbers of malnourished bears may wander about for much of the winter.	Bellemain, Nawaz et al.

In Borneo, Sumatra, and peninsular Malaysia , areas with high rainfall throughout the year, they inhabit mainly tropical evergreen dipterocarp rainforest and peat swamps. They also use mangrove forest and oil palm plantations in proximity to other, more favored habitats. They occur from near sea level to over 2100 m elevation, but are most common in lower elevation forests.	Omnivorous diet includes insects (over 100 species, mainly termites, ants, beetles and bees), honey, and a wide variety of fruits. In Bornean forests, fruits of the families Moraceae (figs), Burseraceae and Myrtaceae make up more than 50% of the fruit diet, but consumption of fruits from at least 20 other families of trees and lianas were identified in just one small study site ( 100 km ?) in East Kalimantan. Availability of foods varies markedly from masting years when most species fruit synchronously, to inter-masting years when little fruit is available and the bears turn mainly to insects. Figs ( Ficus ) are a staple food during inter-mast periods. On the mainland, fruiting is more uniform (predictable) from year to year, but varies seasonally. However, there is an enormous diversity of fruits, so some fruit is available at all times of year. In Thailand , about 40 families of trees are climbed by Sun Bears, mostly for food; fruits from Lauraceae (cinnamon) and Fagaceae (oak) are favorites. Sun Bears are especially known for preying on colonies of stingless bees (7Trigona), including their resinous nesting material. The bees form nests in cavities of live trees, so to prey on them Sun Bears chew and claw through the tree, leaving a conspicuous hole. These bears consume little vegetative matter, although they seem to relish the growth shoots of palm trees (palm hearts), the consumption of which kills the tree. Occasionally they also take reptiles, small mammals, and bird eggs.			Activity has been described as mainly nocturnal or mainly diurnal. This variability depends on proximity to human activities: in heavily disturbed areas, such as oil palm plantations, Sun Bears are chiefly nocturnal. Camera traps along roads typically obtain photographs of bears mainly at night, whereas signals from radio-collared bears farther from roads indicate that they are active mainly during the day. They spend a large proportion of time feeding in trees when fruit is abundant. They also sometimes build tree nests of branches and leaves for sleeping. This behavior has been attributed to previous predation pressure by Tigers; however,it appears to occur commonly only in heavily-disturbed forests or near people. Sun Bears have been observed to slide rapidly down tree trunks when disturbed by people. Although arboreally adept, they cannot swing orjump from tree to tree. Normally they sleep on the ground, often in cavities of either standing or fallen trees, or under such trees. Females use similar sites for birthing dens. This species does not hibernate.

Preferred habitat includes various sorts of humid and very humid montane cloud forest. They also occupy higher elevation elfin forest, and puna and paramo (high-altitude) grasslands, as well as lower elevation thorn forest and scrub desert (in western Peru ).	Omnivorous diet includes many kinds of fruits, vegetative material, and meat. Especially important through most parts of the range are the succulent parts of plants in the family Bromeliaceae , both epiphytic and terrestrial bromeliads. In high altitude grasslands, the heart of the terrestrial Puya is a dietary mainstay, as this bromeliad is the only abundant food available for much of the year. The bears must strip away the stiff thorny leaves to get to the heart, which looks somewhat like a pineapple but is vegetative and bland. Bears may eat only one in ten of this obiquitous plant, possibly related to differences in nutritional composition. In the forest, they regularly climb trees to obtain Tillandsia , an epiphytic bromeliad; they eat the basal meristematic tissue and drop the remaining pieces of leaves to the forest floor, providing a highly visible sign of their feeding activity. Bears select patches (with Puya ) or trees (with Tillandsia ) that have a high density of large bromeliads. Bromeliads compose from 90% to less than 15% of their diet, depending on season and geographic area. Fruits compose the other core part of the diet, varying inversely to the bromeliads. Both shrub and tree-borne fruits are consumed (e.g. Lauraceae , Moraceae , Ericaceae , Euphorbiaceae ). Fruit abundance varies seasonally with rainfall. Other foods include palm petioles, bamboo shoots, bulbs of orchids, and in drier habitats, fruits and pulp of cacti and, remarkably, the soft cortex of the pasallo tree (Bombax discolor). Near human settlements, they routinely raid cornfields. Animal matter is another potentially important food, although never a large dietary component. They eat insects, snails, and small mammals, but more significantly in terms of total nutrition, they occasionally take large mammals such as deer and free-ranging or unguarded pastured cattle. Considerable controversy has surrounded the issue of whether most meat in their diet is from animals that they killed or scavenged—there is clear evidence that they sometimes prey on cattle, but they probably also find carrion. A test of their attraction to beef demonstrated this: a small (0-5 kg) chunk of meat placed in an open area attracted two different radio-collared bears from a distance of 1-5 km in 5-15 hours. When feeding on a cattle carcass, which may take several days to consume, they often construct ground and tree nests for resting. Tree nests are made from a collection of bent and broken branches. They also sometimes build nests in fruit trees.

They slept 9-12 hours at night, awoke near sunrise, took brief rests during the day, and began their night's rest just after sunset. This pattern did not vary seasonally. In other areas, bears are reported to be somewhat more active at night, but are still principally diurnal. Because food is available year-round throughout their range, Andean Bears do not hibernate.

Bamboo is a dominant understory plant in broad-leaved, broad-leaved mixed with conifer, and subalpine conifer forests in the mountainous regions of central China . However, the type and density of bamboo greatly affect habitat use by Giant Pandas. The growth rate of bamboo, and hence its suitability to Pandas,is also related to the amount of overstory tree canopy. Remaining habitat for Pandas is steep and rugged, being the only land that was not farmed and settled by people in a once-extensive range that extended from Beijing to eastern China and south to present day Vietnam and Myanmar . Within this remaining habitat, Pandas seek areas with relatively gentle slopes and high moisture.	Their diet is almost entirely bamboo (over 99%); however, they occasionally feed on leaves, stems or roots of other plants as well as some meat, from rodents and young ungulates, either killed or scavenged. During large-scale flowering and die-off of bamboo, individuals may seek other foods, including crops and human garbage. For unknown reasons, some individuals do this even when bamboo is readily available. Across the six mountain ranges that they inhabit, Giant Pandas utilize over 60 species of bamboo, 35 of which constitute their main food source. They select species higher in protein and lower in fiber, hence more digestible. They use different species of bamboo in different elevational bands, varying with the seasons and coinciding with the germination and growth of the plants. They eat different parts of bamboo at different times of year, alternating between young tender leaves and shoots, versus stems and branches. They prefer shoots and stems of certain lengths and diameters, selecting those that are easier to hold and chew. Pandas sit or recline to eat. Holding a stem in one paw, a Panda inserts it in the side of its mouth and repeatedly and rapidly bites off chunks approximately the width of its palate, chewing very little. Scats of any individual Panda thus have intact fragments of bamboo that are all approximately the same length. This characteristic has been exploited in population surveys, where the size of bamboo fragments in scats is used to differentiate individuals with overlapping home ranges.	Distribution . C China ( Sichuan , Gansu & Shaanxi Provinces).	https://zenodo.org/record/5714495/files/figure.png	Pandas are active about 50% of the day, mostly collecting or eating bamboo. Activity occurs rather uniformly through the day and night, in bursts of a few hours. Little variation occurs seasonally. Unlike other bears, which exhibit an energymaximizing strategy, increasing consumption and activity when food is most plentiful, Pandas are least active when feeding on abundant and nutritious leaves. Because food is available throughout the year, Pandas do not hibernate, although during cold and snowy conditions they may take temporary shelter in hollow trees, rock crevices, and caves. They climb trees, although infrequently, to escape danger, to rest, or in courtship—during the mating season males may vocalize from trees to attract females, and estrous females may climb to fend off suitors. However, they spend less time in trees than several other species of bears (Andean Bears, Sun Bears, Asiatic Black Bears) because they do not feed there.	Endo et al. (1999), Garshelis et al.

They inhabit areas as diverse as dry Mexican scrub forests, Louisiana swamps, Alaskan rainforests, and Labrador tundra (where they occupy the typical niche of the Grizzly Bear). They tend to occupy more forested habitats than the Grizzly Bear, especially where the two species are sympatric. Elevationally they range from sea level to 3000 m , and up to 3500 m for winter denning.	American Black Bears are generalist, opportunistic omnivores with diets varying seasonally from herbaceous vegetation (mainly in spring) to roots, buds, numerous kinds of fleshy fruits, nuts, insects in life stages from egg to adult, and vertebrates from fish to mammals, including their own kills as well as carrion. They are also attracted to human-related foods, including garbage, birdseed, corn, oats, apples, honey and brood in apiaries. Feeding increases dramatically in the fall, in preparation for hibernation, and focuses on foods rich in fat. American chestnuts ( Castanea dentata) were once a key fall food in eastern North America, but after blight destroyed this food source in the early to mid-1900s, oak ( Quercus ) acorns and beechnuts ( Fagus grandifolia) became the main fall foods. Farther west, hazelnuts (Corylus), whitebark pine nuts (Pinus albicaulis), madrone ( Arbutus xalapensis), mansanita ( Arctostaphylos ), huckleberries ( Vaccinium ), and buffalo berries (Shepherdia canadensis) are principalfall foods. In arid regions, succulents such as yucca and cacti are important, especially during droughts.			Mainly diurnal, commonly with an early morning and evening peak in activity and a lull in midday. They tend to sleep through the night, but nocturnal activity may increase during fall, especially in places with clumped, abundant foods. It has been theorized that gut capacity and passage rates of food may limit the length of feeding bouts when intake rates are high, prompting more uniform feeding throughout the day. Alternately, or additionally, large weight gains in fall may pose energetic constraints on feeding. More nocturnal activity also occurs when feeding in areas near human activity. Total time active per day averages 50-60%, but may be less when abundant human-related foods are available. Virtually no activity occurs for the 3-7 months of winter hibernation. In some southern portions of the range, where food is available year-round, only parturient females and those with cubs from the previous year hibernate.	Alt (1989), Ayres et al.

Most of range coincides with forest, especially forests with hard mast (oak or beech), but is also found in regenerating forests with berries and cultivated plantations. This species also occupies arid subtropical thorn-forests (southern Iran and Pakistan ) and seasonally uses alpine meadows. In tropical South-east Asia, Asiatic Black Bears inhabit both evergreen and deciduous forests, virtually the same as the Sun Bear, except Sun Bears rarely reach into montane habitats (above 1200 m ).	Foods often include succulent vegetation (shoots, roots, forbs and leaves) in spring, insects and a variety of tree and shrub-borne fruits in summer, and nuts (hard mast) in autumn. In some areas, mammalian ungulates (especially smallbodied species) may compose a sizeable portion of the diet; however, these bears rarely eat fish. Asiatic Black Bears regularly climb trees to obtain fruits, because most fruits in their range are tree-borne. In tropical regions fruit diversity is especially high. For example, in Thailand their diet includes over 80 species of tree-borne fruits, commonly including those in the cinnamon ( Lauraceae ), pea-bean (Leguminosae), mahogany ( Meliaceae ), and oak-beech-chestnut ( Fagaceae ) families. In temperate regions, where they must store fat for hibernation, hard mast, such as oak acorns, beechnuts, walnuts, chestnuts, hazelnuts, and pine nuts, is a key fall dietary component. When feeding in hard mast trees they often break branches inward toward the trunk and pile them up in the canopy forming a platform or “nest” upon which they sit. When natural forest foods are lacking, they feed in agricultural fields (corn, oats, millet, barley, buckwheat) and fruit orchards. In plantations, when food supplies are short, they strip bark and eat cambium of conifer trees, damaging the trees.			Active diurnally most of the year, often with peak activity periods in morning and evening. More uniformly active, day and night, during the fall, when foods are clumped and abundant. Overall level of activity may vary seasonally, but is generally in the range of 50-60% over a 24hour period. In northern latitudes, where food becomes unavailable in winter, both sexes hibernate. They typically den November—April, but some remain in dens until the end of May (which is later than other species of bears). In the tropics, except for females giving birth during the winter, Asiatic Black Bears generally do not hibernate.	Bromlei (1965), Carr et al.

Densities are highest in alluvial grasslands, and second-highest in moist or dry deciduous forests. Characteristically a lowland species, mainly limited to habitats below 1500 m , but ranges up to 2000 m in the forests of the Western Ghats, India . In Sri Lanka ,it inhabits dry monsoon forests below 300 m . The climate throughout the range is monsoonal, with pronounced wet and dry seasons. This causes some variation in food habits and habitat use: very dry or very wet conditions can hamper feeding on termite colonies.	Sloth Bears are both myrmecophagous and frugivorous. Ants, termites, and fruit dominate their diet, with proportions varying seasonally and regionally. Fruits (from at least ten families of trees and shrubs) constitute up to 90% of the diet during the fruiting season in southern India and 70% in Sri Lanka , but less than 40% in Nepal , where fewerfruits are available. Sloth Bears more often eat fallen fruits off the ground than climb to eatfruits in trees. However, they will readily climb to consume honey. During the non-fruiting season, insects make up 95% of the diet in Nepal and 75-80% in S India and Sri Lanka . The relative proportion of termites to ants in the diet also varies considerably by region; in Nepal and Sri Lanka this ratio 1s more than 2:1, whereas in central India the ratio varies from about 1:1 to 1:5, favoring ants. Sloth Bears feed on termites by digging into their mounds or underground colonies, then alternately sucking up the termites and blowing away debris. These distinctive “vacuuming” sounds can be heard from 200 m away. Although most of their diggings are less than 60 cm deep, they occasionally dig down 1-2 m. Sloth Bears typically eat little vegetative matter other than fruits and some flowers, and they rarely prey on mammals or eat carrion. However, where their habitat is severely degraded by intensive human use and most of their normal foods are not available, they feed heavily on cultivated fruits and agricultural crops such as peanuts, corn, potatoes, and yams.			These bears are more nocturnal than other bears, likely a response to the heat and sparse cover of their environment. Overall amount of activity varies widely, from 40-70% of the 24hour day, depending on conditions. In a national park in Nepal , with dense cover and moderate temperatures, most Sloth Bears are active both day and night, but are more active at night; conversely, subadults and females with cubs are diurnal, possibly to avoid being killed by nocturnal predators (Tigers) and other bears. In a park in Sri Lanka , with higher temperatures but dense cover, the bears are similarly more active at night and show lowerlevels of activity during the day. Where cover is much sparser, Sloth Bears often remain in shelter dens, usually crevices among boulders in rocky hillocks, the whole day, becoming active only near sunset. In central India , average daytime temperatures immediately outside shelter dens under a patchy (less than 25%) tree canopy, average 39°C (up to 44°C) compared to 28°C inside the dens. In winter, pregnant females den to give birth, whereas males and non-pregnant females remain active. It is unclear whether denning females actually undergo physiological hibernation in terms of reduced metabolism, recycling of body wastes, and preservation of muscle mass; they do not have large fat supplies to sustain them,like hibernating bears of other species, but they manage to survive without eating or drinking for 2 months. About 2 weeks before emerging from birthing dens with their cubs, they make nightly excursions from the den to feed.	Akhtar et al. (2004, 2007), Bargali et al.

Okapis browse well over a hundred different species of plants of which twenty are favored, including Scaphopetalum dewevrei, Drypetes sp., and Diospyros bipendensis. They forage along well-trodden paths through the forests. They feed in small tree-fall gaps and on the edges of blowdowns. They browse by twining their long prehensile tongues around branchlets, stripping the leaves and pulling them into the mouth. They walk slowly, with a gait similar to that of the Giraffe’s, sampling leaves from right and left from palatable shrubs. They do not feed on herbaceous monocotyledons, some of which are important in the diets of chimpanzees (Pan spp.) and gorillas (Gorillaspp.), and they do not compete for browse with the relatively few other occupants of their forest biome. Duikers (Cephalophus spp.) and Water Chevrotains (Hyemoschus aquaticus) favor fallen fruits and seeds; Bongos (Tragelaphus eurycerus), African buffaloes (Syncerus spp.), sitatungas (Tragelaphus spp.), Giant Forest Hogs (Hylochoerus meinertzhageni), Bush Pigs (Potamochoerus porcus), and African Forest Elephants (Loxodonta cyclotis) all feed on foliage from canopy trees in sunlit clearings and swampy openings. Distribution of the Okapi’s food plants favors dispersed rather than congregated foraging. Nowhere is the forage abundant enough to support a herd, nor do the Okapis converge on seasonally-varying food sources, as there is continuous growth of new leaves. Females occupy forest areas that are richest in their favored food plants. There is a greater density of suitable browse in tree-fall gaps, as indicated by a change in locomotion of Okapi when feeding in gaps. When browsing in the subcanopy, their gait is steady, whereas when feeding in a tree-fall gap they walk more slowly, frequently pausing to feed on several plants from one position. Under the canopy and in gaps Okapis are selective browsers, eating only a small proportion of the species present and focussing on the youngest leaves. Food supply in the Ituri forest is patchy and variable in quality and distribution. Okapis exhibit geophagia, ingesting dirt in search of minerals.

Four species of Acacia and four species of Combretum predominate in their diet, as these are rich in protein and calcium to support growth of their large skeleton. Bulls browse at higher levels than cows. Giraffes are water dependent but can survive for long periods without drinking water, obtaining their daily water needs from succulent browse. Giraffids are foliovores, selecting succulent foliage, and have an efficient digestive system compared to that of grazers, which eat monocotiyledons. The Giraffe stomach is half the size of that of African buffalo (Syncerus sp.).				Aschaffenburg et al. (1962), Badlangana et al.

It also lives in Mediterranean maquis scrub, in alpine summit meadows, and in the treeless moorlands of Scotland . It prefers broadleaved woodlands interspersed by large meadows. Up to 2800 m above sea level on the Alps. In west-central Asia it occurs in woody and shrubby thickets along riverbanks in desert areas.	As an intermediate feeder with a relatively large rumen,it tends to eat a mixed diet of about 30% grass and sedges and about 65% browse, without significant differences among seasons. Fruits and seeds are important items in autumn. It is a very versatile species, consuming up to 300 different species of plants. The two sexes tend to differ in diet composition, hinds eating higher quality food. Stags eat on average 14-16 kg and females around 9-10 kg offresh vegetation per day. Actual food intake follows appetite cycles related to photoperiod and hormones, which are highest in March—June and lowest in late September-December. Lactating hinds more than double their energy requirements.			It is active all the day, with peaks at dawn and in early evening, alternating 6-8 periods of foraging, ruminating, resting, and moving from place to place. It dedicates 7-12 hours to feeding.

Originally it was associated with early successional stages of the forest, young tracts of woods and scrubland. During the Neolithic Revolution, when a transition occurred from huntinggathering to agriculture and settlements, progressive forest fragmentation and the creation of wood clearings, meadows, and cultivated areas, gave Western Roe Deer new opportunities. The higher proportion of forest edge in the mosaic landscapes typical of traditional agriculture was particularly suitable to the species. Today Western Roe Deer occur in a wide variety of habitats, from the maquis scrub of the Mediterranean coast to the boreal forests of Scandinavia, and from Scottish moorlands to modern farmland with scarce cover. They live in the Alps up to 2400 m . Northern and north-eastern range limits seem to be largely determined by snow depth. The heavy foot loading and the low chest height makeit difficult to move in snow more than 40 cm deep.	Western Roe Deer are typical selective feeders or concentrate selectors, preferring soft food rich in soluble carbohydrates, proteins, and water. They have a relatively small rumen (4-6 1) and abomasum, and large salivary glands and liver; they are able to detoxify secondary plant metabolites. They are opportunistic and flexible deer, consuming up to 370 plant species at the regional level and about 1000 at the continental scale. Buds, shoots, and leaves of shrubs and deciduous trees, and green leaves and flowers of forbs (dicotyledon herbs) are particularly important; seeds and fruits are also eaten, especially in autumn. It seems that roe deer have physiological mechanisms that allow soluble carbohydrates to avoid microbial fermentation in the rumen and to be directly absorbed in the small intestine. With the onset of vegetation growth in spring, metabolic rate and food intake increase, reaching a peak during early lactation and the rutting period in summer; in winter basal metabolism and appetite decline. Daily food intake is 2—4 kg of fresh vegetation. Since roe deer have very scarce body reserves of fat, they need to obtain most nutrients directly from their food. This requires a greater tolerance for food of low nutritional quality, especially in winter, which is unusual for a browser. Special adaptations of the salivary glands make roe deer, unlike most herbivores, insensitive to toxic effects of high concentrations of tannins.	Most of Europe (excluding Iceland , Ireland , and Mediterranean Is), Caucasus, and Near East.	https://zenodo.org/record/6514501/files/figure.png	The small size of the stomach requires the deer to feed frequently, generally 9-11 times during a 24hour day. Roe deer are active all day, alternating periods of foraging, ruminating, resting, and moving. Feeding bouts at dawn and dusk have the longest duration.	Andersen et al. (1998), Apollonio et al.

Throughoutits range, the Northern Pudu uses several habitat types, especially high altitude montane forests and the humid paramo grasslands above the tree-line. Montane forests occupied are humid rainforests such as elfin and cloud forests, frequently close to paramo grasslands, which are primarily used by populations in the northern part of the range. The main altitude used by Northern Pudus is 2000-4000 m, with records as high as 4500 m in Ecuador . Paramo can be characterized as a humid grassland mixed with short, flowering vegetation such as terrestrial bromeliads, mosses, lichens, tree-ferns, and various other bushes. Throughout its distribution, this species endures low temperatures, with frequent night-time frost in the higher altitudes. Precipitation is high in all habitat types used, and includes rain, snow, and fog.	The Northern Pudu is assumed to be a browser feeding mainly on leaves and fruits. According to the observations of local people in Peru ,it climbs trees to forage on fruit. The species is known to encroach on agriculturalfields to feed on crops in areas of higher human habitation.	It ranges through temperate zone forests and paramos from the Cordillera Central in C Colombia through the Cordillera Oriental of Ecuador to the eastern Andean cloud forests in Peru , southward to Junin department. The exact range is unknown and there are obvious distributional gaps. One major natural gap is the dry forest south of the Huancabamba depression, which separates the northern population from the main Peruvian population.	https://zenodo.org/record/6514537/files/figure.png	It is crepuscular and nocturnal, but given the lack of good observational data on this species, it may have more complicated patterns of foraging and resting throughout the day.

Availability of the copepod Calanus finmarchicus is considered an important factor in habitat suitability of North Atlantic Right Whales. Interestingly, although C. finmarchicus is dormant throughout the Gulf of Maine during winter, North Atlantic Right Whales apparently continue to prey on them at great depths in smaller regional basins. Young copepods develop during onset of the seasonal thermocline and the spring phytoplankton bloom into late-stage copepodites and adults by late spring. Data on prey species and oceanographic parameters have been used to model habitat suitability for North Atlantic Right Whales on a weekly timescale in Cape Cod Bay and Great South Channel of the North Atlantic Ocean, and they demonstrated that habitat use patterns change seasonally. Inclusion of prey as a variable was an important factor in model accuracy; presence of C. finmarchicus was most influential to habitat suitability in winter and spring. Such habitat modeling allows prediction of whale presence on a real-time basis and may be important to conservation efforts. During the birthing season in winter, pregnant females are often observed in relatively sheltered, shallow coastal regions in their southern distribution. For pregnant females, presence of prey may be a less important factor in habitat selection than winter oceanographic conditions. As in other mysticete species, there is some evidence of maternal habitat fidelity in North Atlantic Right Whales and indication of learned habitat selection. Offspring learn suitable habitat in the company of their mothers, returning to those habitats in subsequent years.	The North Atlantic Right Whale feeds mainly on calanoid copepods, most commonly C. finmarchicus. Documented prey items also include Pseudocalanus spp., Centropages spp., barnacle larvae, juvenile euphausiids, and a variety of nektonic plankton. The North Atlantic Right Whale is a skim feeder, swimming slowly with mouth open through densely concentrated swarms of prey, closing the mouth occasionally to flush out water. Feeding occurs at the water’s surface and, more frequently, deep below the surface. Feeding near the seafloor also apparently occurs occasionally. Generally, whales skimming with their mouths open at the surface, stop, closing their mouths, after having reached the end of a prey patch. Whales feeding at depth breath in c.10-15minute intervals, and thus their mouth-closing actions are more regular. Feeding dives commonly last c.10-20 minutes.	N Atlantic, ranging from feeding areas used from spring to autumn (including Gulf of Maine, Bay of Fundy, and as far N as Nova Scotia) to the latewinter birthing grounds along the SE coast of North America (off Florida and Georgia), as well as sightings in the Gulf of Mexico and off Bermuda to the S; there are occasional records from Greenland, Iceland, and Norway. In the E Atlantic, historical records range S to Cintra Bay (23° N), Western Sahara.	https://zenodo.org/record/6595823/files/figure.png	Right whales, in general, are commonly slow moving and occasionally rest at the surface for long periods. Nevertheless, the North Atlantic Right Whale is frequently observed engaged in active surface behavior, including breaching, lobtailing, flipper slapping, and raising flukes proceeding deep dives. It also has been observed to be very tactile, touching and rubbing conspecifics.	Allen (1916), Baumgartner & Mate (2003, 2005), Baumgartner, Cole, Campbell et al.

Historical records are indicative of pelagic feeding grounds in the Sea of Okhotsk, central and south-eastern Bering Sea, the Aleutian Islands, and Gulf of Alaska. In recent decades, consistent summer sightings of North Pacific Right Whales in the Sea of Okhotsk and off the Kuril Islands and Kamchatka coast substantiate these areas as important feeding grounds. Based upon repeated sightings west of Bristol Bay in the south-eastern Bering Sea, this region is important summer habitat. In this area, North Pacific Right Whales appear to select relatively shallow waters in the mid-continental shelf. Not surprisingly, distribution of North Pacific Right Whales has been noted to coincide with areas abundant in their primary prey, calanoid copepods. North Pacific Right Whales also appear to have an extensive pelagic distribution, and this is likely related to availability of adultstage copepods in these regions of the Pacific Ocean. Birthing grounds are not known. Areas that have been suggested as potential winter birthing grounds for the western North Pacific population, based on sightings and other information, include the Ryukyu Islands, Yellow Sea, Taiwan Strait, and Bonin Islands (= Ogasawara Islands). There is no information regarding the current wintering grounds of the eastern North Pacific population, except a sighting off southern Baja California, Mexico. In the central North Pacific, the southernmost recent sighting was off Maui, Hawaii. The possibility that the North Pacific Right Whale winters in distant, offshore regions has been raised.	North Pacific Right Whales are skim feeders. They appear to feed selectively on preferred prey species, as has been observed for the other balaenid species. Aggregations of North Pacific Right Whales feeding on copepods of the genus Neocalanus have been observed in the North Pacific Ocean, and these, along with copepods of the genus Calanus, are the main prey items reported for western North Pacific Right Whales. Stomachs of North Pacific Right Whales killed by Japanese and Soviet whaling vessels in the 1950s contained calanoid copepods (Neocalanus, Calanus, and Metnidia). Quantities of the amphipod crustacean Parathemisto japonica and the krill species Euphausia pacifica also were found in stomach contents. Scientists onboard the whaling vessels also conducted pelagic zooplankton sampling in areas of the southeastern Bering Sea occupied by whales and noted that Calanus finmarchicus (now recognized as C. marshallae) was abundant; the copepod was postulated to be important to North Pacific Right Whales in that region. More recently, North Pacific Right Whales have been observed feeding in shallow waters over the middle Bering Sea shelf where C. marshallae was the primary species in plankton samples.	Cold-temperate waters of the N Pacific, from Bonin Is (27° N, 142° E) and Ryukyu Is N to Yellow Sea, Sea ofJapan, Sea of Okhotsk, Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska; occasionally reaching tip of Baja California, Mexico, to the S of E Pacific in winter.

They were noted to remain calm and generally show no attempt at avoidance when approached by whaling vessels. Although North Pacific Right Whales were reported by soviet scientists to make shore dives of 4-6 minutes with maximum dive times of nine minutes,it is likely that most feeding dives for this species average 10-20 minutes like those of their congeners, the North Atlantic Right Whale and the Southern Righ Whale.

In the southern Atlantic Ocean, they may be mainly offshore, and in Antarctic waters, they are also apparently predominately offshore. As with other species of right whales, feeding grounds of Southern Right Whales are likely to be areas of extremely high productivity and prey abundance. Most of the relatively few offshore sightings indicate individuals may occupy areas within the subtropical and Antarctic convergences. Sheltered, shallow waters and bays in many coastal areas are used to give birth. These birthing grounds include areas off Argentina, Brazil, Tristan da Cunha, Namibia, South Africa, Mozambique, Australia, New Zealand, Auckland Islands, and Chile.	Southern Right Whales are skim feeders, using their long, finely bristled baleen to filter prey from the water at the surface and below. Both copepods and krill are important in their diets. Euphausiids, including euphausiid krill (Euphausia superba) and squat lobster (Munida spp.), form a larger part of diets of Southern Right Whales than those of North Atlantic Right Whales ( E. glacialis ) and North Pacific Right Whales ( E. japonica ). When feeding north of the subtropical convergence, Southern Right Whales are likely to feed mainly on copepods, but they also feed on euphausiid krill within the Antarctic Convergence where krill predominates. Interestingly, whaling data reflected this pattern: 91-7% of whales north of 40° S had fed on copepods (mainly Calanus propinquus and Pleuromamma robusta), whereas more than 99% of whales south of 50° S had euphausiids in their stomachs.	Cold-temperate waters of the Southern Hemisphere, mainly at 20-60° S except on both coasts of South America, where they occur at most lower latitudes. Concentrated in winter near the coastlines off S Australia, New Zealand, Atlantic coast of South America (Argentina, Brazil), and S Africa (mainly South Africa), but also off Chile, Peru, Tristan da Cunha Is and the E coast of Madagascar; in summer they are found mainly in latitudes of 40-50° S but have been seen in the Antarctic as far as 65° S and around South Georgia Is.	https://zenodo.org/record/6595829/files/figure.png	Like their congeners, Southern Right Whales are slow moving, often resting or logging at the surface. They are also often observed breaching and engaging in other active behaviors at the water’s surface, including flipper slapping and lobtailing. Southern Right Whales in Argentina and South Africa use their flukes as sails at the water’s surface, letting the wind glide them through the water for short distances. Tactile behavior—touching and rubbing conspecifics—has also been observed in Southern Right Whales.	Aguayo et al.

It has been suggested that these icy regions serve as a refuge from Killer Whales (Orcinus orca). Bowhead Whales select habitat in the Arctic that is characterized by high productivity and availability of zooplankton prey. In summer, they generally occupy continental slope waters with moderate ice conditions. In autumn, Bowhead Whales occupy inner shelf waters with relatively light ice conditions.	Stomach contents of Bowhead Whales have been well documented. Numerous prey species have been identified in their stomachs, but there is a clear preference for copepods (Calanus) and eupausiid krill. Mysid shrimps and gammarid amphipods are also sometimes prevalent in stomachs of Bowhead Whales. They skim the water’s surface to feed and also feed in the water column and at the seafloor. Bowhead Whales have been observed surface skimming synchronously, moving on their sides with mouths open, synchronously diving and surfacing while feeding, and cooperatively feeding, including in echelon formation. Typical feeding dives may last 5-15 minutes.	Circumpolar in the N Atlantic Ocean (NE Canada-W Greenland and E Greenland, Svalbard, Barents and Kara seas) and N Pacific Ocean (Bering—Chuckchi-Beaufort seas and Sea of Okhotsk).	https://zenodo.org/record/6595831/files/figure.png	Bowhead Whales are slow moving, and they are also observed breaching and fluke slapping at the surface. Flukes are lifted prior to deep dives. Data for eight Bowhead Whales equipped with satellite-monitored radio tags in the Beaufort and Chuckchi seas for approximately one month indicated that many dives were short, less than one minute in duration. Most dives were shallow to c¢.16 m. Five of the whales dove deeper than 100 m, with the deepest dive recorded at 352 m. Deeper dives, which occurred over the deep-water Mackenzie Canyon, were thought to be associated with feeding behavior. Bowhead Whales may be capable of dives with durations of up to approximately one hour. They can break through ice of ¢.60 cm thick and may sometimes make their way through ice floes in this manner.

In Ecuador , Peters’s Ghostfaced Bat occurs in cloud forest at elevations of 2350-2700 m. It seems to be more common in hot lowland areas in its northern distribution and in forested areas in tropical regions.	Peters’s Ghostfaced Bat feeds mostly on large moths, usually with body lengths of 5-6 mm; other prey items include beetles and flies.			Peters’s Ghost-faced Bats usually roost in large and deep cave systems or in abandoned mine shafts. Although they have been observed in roosts with wide ranges of temperatures (over 15°C) and humidity (over 50%), females only use hot caves as maternity roosts. Peters’s Ghost-faced Bats fly higher and faster than other mormoopids, usually foraging in open spaces along canyons and over streams. They are more commonly caught in caves or in other day roosts than in mist nets. They usually become active later than other species of mormoopids, emerging from day roosts after dark. In Ecuador , two activity peaks have been reported. Echolocation calls during search phase consist of steep FM downsweep pulses of ¢.3-5-5 milliseconds, with three harmonics; second harmonic of 48-54 kHz is usually of high intensity.

It hides during the day in dens located in hollow trees, hollow logs, caves, or underbrush piles or roots of large trees (it does not dig its own burrow). It defecates regularly at the same place, either under a rock or in a den. It walks and trots along the forest floor, swims readily, and can climb trees to a limited extent to escape pursuit threat. While moving, it carriesits tail held slightly upward and back from its body; sometimes rustling of rattle-quills can be heard even when it cannot be seen. African Brush-tailed Porcupines in the wild in Gabon typically left their hiding places at ¢.17:00 h, returning to their dens at c¢.05:30 h. Nightly activity, particularly among females, usually followed a trimodal pattern with two rest periods during the night, although the pattern shifted to bimodal on moonlit nights. Female rest periods clustered around 20:00-21:00 h and again at 02:00-04:00 h. Males spent more time immobile and had more irregular patterns, resting in the middle of the night. Individuals also took rest periods of about ten minutes every hour; these rests tended to be longer in the middle of the night than at the start or end, and longer in the presence of bright moonlight. On dark nights, females did not normally take a rest in the middle of night, although males rested some of the time. Average inactive time on dark nights was 1-9 hours. On nights close to full moonlight, period of inactivity increased to an average of 3-4 hours. When alarmed or threatened, an African Brush-tailed Porcupine will raise spines on its back and shakeits tail, rustling the bristles. If, after this warning display,it remains threatened, it will move quickly sideways and backward with its sharp, pointed quills facing forward toward the opponent.	Albrechtsen et al.

Individuals spend their days at rest in burrows. In Italy, a Crested Porcupine might share its burrow with a European Badger (Meles meles). The Crested Porcupine is active across a wide range of temperatures, with mean duration of nocturnal and crepuscular activity in central Italy lasting on average 9-2 hours/night, varying little throughout the year. In cold months when nights were longer, individuals left burrows after sunset and returned some hours before sunrise. In the warm season, they left at sunset or shortly before and returned at or shortly after sunrise. Moonlight avoidance is slight. Diurnal activity is scarce. When alarmed, a Crested Porcupine first raises its quills and erects its crest; second,it rattles its tail; and third, it stomps its hindfeet and growls. If these displays fail to deter a threat, it may attack by moving rapidly backward and sideways toward it, stabbing it with its long defensive quills that detach easily from the skin.

It is particularly adept at exploiting patchy vegetation of semiarid and arid habitats. In the Negev Desert,it eats at least 18 species of geophytes (tubers, bulbs, corms, rhizomes and other subterranean structures) and hemicryptophytes. Its use of geophytes increases water balance and reduce exposure to plants with low nutrient content, low digestibility, or high concentrations of secondary metabolites. Fasted captive Indian Crested Porcupines consumed 528-7 g potatoes within 45 minutes and averaged 147-9 g/hour thereafter. Averaged total intake was 1239-4 g fresh mass for 5-8 h of feeding. Nightly intakes were 198-3 g dry matter, 1092 ml preformed water, and 3056 kJ of energy. Maintenance energy requirement of captive porcupines was 220 kJ/kg/day. In the Negev Desert, daily water intake was significantly higher in summer than winter, although there were no differences in seasonal ad libitum food intake by captive individuals. The Indian Crested Porcupine also eats grains and fruits. Digging as a form of ecological disturbance has an important positive role in increasing plant biomass, density, and species richness across patchy landscapes of the Negev Desert. Density of porcupine digs in highlands of the Negev Desert varied from more than 1 dig/m? on a densely vegetated plateau to 0-1 dig/m? on a sparsely vegetated deep loess. Digs of Indian Crested Porcupines persist for 1-6-5 years, depending on size. Individuals appeared to exploit the same food patches over time. Investigatory sniffing is a major behavior probably associated with searching for food. Indian Crested Porcupines use a stereotypical posture when eating, in which body is prone, hindlegs are outstretched, and forelimbs rest on ground; food items are manipulated with inner front paws. The Indian Crested Porcupine can be a pest to agriculture by raiding crops and to forestry by debarking trees at ground level. In India, it is destructive to sweet potato, sugarcane, and maize crops and production forests. It gnaws bones, horns, and antlers. In Israel, consumption of roots and aboveground crops and bark of cultivated trees and damage to irrigation tubing causesit to be regarded as the most important agricultural pest among the country’s large mammals. Time required to forage might limit occurrence of Indian Crested Porcupines to areas where nights are not less than seven hours. Most northern populations are at ¢.44° N, where night duration at summersolstice is ¢.7-3 hours. To occur north of this boundary, Indian Crested Porcupines would have to forage during daylight or reduce food intake. Otherwise, northern distributional limits do not coincide with broad bioclimatic or vegetation boundaries.			Indian Crested Porcupines are strictly nocturnal. They spend daytime hours in dens (natural caves or excavated burrows). Timing of den emergence varies with season. In winter, they largely confine their behavior to darker nights or darker periods of the night and strongly avoid bright moonlight. In summer, they are active independent of moonlight given the shorter nights. Mean duration of nocturnal activity is 9-2 hours in summervs. 6-7 hours in winter. Indian Crested Porcupines remain closer to dens on bright nights than dark nights throughout the year. Rainfall curtails activity. Activity pattern may be influenced by predation risk; one study used the method of “giving up density” and found that porcupines have lowest foraging costs in habitats with densest cover and on dark nights. In a camera trapping study in western Nepal, porcupine activity was significantly more common during the central part of the night (23:00 h to 02:00 h) than in crepuscular or daylight periods. When sensing danger, Indian Crested Porcupines erect their quills and rattle their tails menacingly.

In South Africa, Cape Porcupines prefer Burkea—Acacia savanna, probably due to concentration of preferred foods. They are not found in swampy areas.	The Cape Porcupine is omnivorous and eats subterranean tubers, bulbs, and roots; shoots; fruits; and stems. Osteophagy is common, particularly in phosphorous-limited areas. It might eat carrion. It is considered a pest by farmers; it will raid melon, pumpkin, and maize crops; uproot young trees; and damage young plantations by debarking and feeding on innerliving tissue of trees from ground level to c.0-5 m up the trunk. Cape Porcupines are ecosystem engineers because their foraging has landscape-level effects through food choice and physical effects of digging. Selective bark feeding in some natural savanna ecosystems may influence patterns of succession. Cape Porcupines dig circular, conical holes in the soil surface in search of tubers, insect larvae, and seeds, which creates sites for seedlings and allows water to infiltrate the soil crust. Digging by Cape Porcupines annually disturbs 0-34% ofthe soil surface and displace 1-6 m®/ha/year ofsoil acrossits distribution.	S one-half of Africa, from S of the Republic of the Congo and S DR Congo E to S Uganda, SW Kenya, and Tanzania (not in Zanzibar I), and S to South Africa, excluding Namibian coast.	https://zenodo.org/record/6612243/files/figure.png	Cape Porcupines are nocturnal. They spend their days at rest in shelters in rock crevices, caves, or abandoned burrows of Aardvarks (Orycteropus afer), which they modify to suit their needs with their front claws. They may excavate their own holes or use termite mounds as dens. Cape Porcupines often bring bones into their shelters. They forage alone at night, although pairs forage near one another, spending less than 25% of their active periods more than 400 m apart and spending more than 50% of active time within 200 m of one another. A pair of Cape Porcupines foraging in proximity of one other could be mate guarding because it is not apparent that they cooperate in foraging or anti-predator defense. When alarmed, defensive action is to raise quills and shake the rattle-quills. If a threat does not subside, a Cape Porcupine might attack by backing rapidly toward the threat, stabbing it with long defensive quills that detach easily from skin.	van Aarde (1985, 1987, 1998), van Aarde & Skinner (1986), van Aarde & van Wyk (1991), Alexander (1956), Barthelmess (2006), Bragg et al.

Stable sand dunes are believed to be ideal habitat, although the foxes also live in very sparsely vegetated sand dunes near the Atlantic coast. Annual rainfall is less than 100 mm per year on the northern fringe of the Fennec’s distribution. On the southern fringe, it may be found up to the Sahelian areas that receive as much as 300 mm rainfall per year. In the Sahara, sparse vegetation is usually dominated by Aristida spp., and Ephedra alata in large sand dunes. On small sand dunes, it is dominated by Panicum turgidum, Zygophyllum spp., and sometimes by trees like Acacia spp. and Capparis decidua.	Fennecs are omnivorous, consuming insects, small rodents (e.g. Jaculus jaculus, Gerbillus spp. , and Meriones spp. ), lizards (e.g. Acanthodactylus spp.), geckos (e.g. Stenodactylus spp.), skinks (e.g. Scincus albifasciatus), eggs, small birds (e.g. larks and sandgrouse), and various fruits and tubers. Fennecs hunt alone. They have not been seen using the “mouse jump” hunting strategy typical of most fox species, but reportedly dig to find insects and small vertebrates. Like other foxes they cache food by burying it.	Widespread in the sandy deserts and semi-deserts of N Africa to N Sinai .	https://zenodo.org/record/6331231/files/figure.png	Primarily nocturnal, although crepuscular activity is also reported.

All the records collected on the Persian Plateau are from foothills and mountains in the vicinity of lower plains and basins, where the species’ habitat comprises the slopes of rocky mountains with stony plains and patches of cultivation. Appears to avoid higher mountain ranges and lower, warmer valleys, although the densest known population is found in the Judaean Desert, 100-350 m below sea level. In the Middle East, Blanford’s Foxes are confined to mountainous desert ranges and inhabit steep, rocky slopes, canyons, and cliffs. Blanford’s Foxes are not limited by access to water in the Arabian Desert, and in Israel they inhabit the driest and hottest regions.	Blanford’s Foxes in Israel are primarily insectivorous and frugivorous. Invertebrates are the major food, beetles, grasshoppers, ants, and termites being eaten most often. They eat the fruits of two caperbush species, Capparis cartilaginea and C. spinosa, fruits and plant material of Phoenix dactylifera, Ochradenus baccatus, Fagonia mollis, and various species of Gramineae. Remains of vertebrates were present in about 10% of fecal samples analysed in one study. Blanford’s Foxes in Pakistan are largely frugivorous, feeding on Russian olives (Eleagnus bortensis), melons, and grapes. They are almost always solitary foragers, only occasionally foraging in pairs. Foraging behavior includes unhurried movements back and forth between rocky patches in a small area, sniffing and looking under large stones and occasionally digging, standing near a bush prior to circling the bush or pouncing upon prey within, and short, fast sprints after small terrestrial or low-flying prey. Food caching is rare or absent, unlike other fox species.	Arid mountainous regions of the Middle East. Known populations in Egypt , Israel , Jordan , Oman , Saudi Arabia , and United Arab Emirates . The species also ranges across much of Afghanistan and Iran , and surrounding regions in Pakistan , Tajikistan , Turkmenistan , and Uzbekistan .	https://zenodo.org/record/6331229/files/figure.png	Strictly nocturnal, likely an anti-predator response to diurnal raptors. The onset of activity is governed largely by light conditions, and closely follows sunset. Foxes are active about 8-9 hours per night, independent of the duration of darkness. Average distance travelled per night is approximately 9 km . Climatic conditions at night in the desert appear to have little direct effect on the activity of Blanford’s Foxes.

Also in lowland fynbos in the Western Cape , as well as agricultural lands, where the foxes lie up in surviving pockets of natural vegetation during the day and forage on arable and cultivated fields at night. Along the eastern flank of the Namib Desert in Namibia , they occupy rock outcroppings and inselbergs, ranging out onto bare gravel plains at night. In Botswana , they have been recorded in Acacia scrubland, short grassland, and especially on the edges of shallow seasonal pans, as well as cleared and overgrazed areas. In the central Karoo of South Africa they occupy the plains as well as low, rocky ridges and isolated rock outcroppings. In KwaZulu-Natal , South Africa , they have been recorded at elevations of 1000-1500 m .	The Cape Fox consumes a wide range of food items, including small rodents (murids), hares, reptiles, birds, invertebrates, and some wild fruits. An analysis of the contents of 57 stomachs collected across western and central South Africa and Botswana showed that rodents were the most commonly eaten mammal prey; beetles (larvae and adults) and grasshoppers comprised the majority of invertebrate intake. Birds and reptiles are occasionally included in the diet, but are probably less important. The largest wild prey species recorded are hares and spring hares. Cape Foxes will also scavenge and occasionally take young lambs and goats. Foraging is solitary, although foxes may occasionally gather in loose groupings to forage at an abundant food source. They obtain their prey mostly by digging rapidly with their front paws, often preceded by periods of intentlistening. Caching of prey is common.	Cape Foxes have expanded their range over recent decades to the SW, where the species reaches the Atlantic and Indian Ocean coastlines. May occur in SW Swaziland , and possibly also in Lesotho .	https://zenodo.org/record/6331227/files/figure.png	Cape Foxes forage almost exclusively at night, peaking shortly after sundown and just before dawn.

In Saudi Arabia , Ruppell’s Fox has been found in open and stony habitat, often with sparse vegetation that includes herb and grass species (Fagonia indica, Indigofera spinosa, Tribulus spp., Stipagrostis spp., and Panicum turgidum). Annual rainfall averages 100 mm per year, with a maximum of 240 mm per year. On the northern fringe of the Sahara, Ruppell’s Fox may be found in areas with up to 150 mm annual rainfall. In Morocco the general habitat offers sparse to very sparse vegetation cover, dominated by small brushes (Hammada scoparia, Panicum turgidum, Fagonia spp.) mostly concentrated in wadis (with Acacia Spp., Argania spinosa, Balanites aegyptiaca, Maerua crassifolia, and Capparis decidua trees). Ruppell’s Foxes also live in coastal areas with extremely sparse vegetation and no trees. They can survive in areas without any available water, as in central Saudi Arabia on the fringes of the Arabian Empty Quarter, in Algeria , and in the western Sahara .	Generalist predators, with a high invertebrate content in their diet, as well as rodents, lizards, snakes, birds, and wild fruits. Some studies have shown that Ruppell’s Foxes consume prey relative to availability, suggesting opportunistic feeding habits. Little is known about their feeding behavior except that they forage alone, and may scavenge at camps and permanent human settlements.			Mainly crepuscular and nocturnal. They tend to remain in dens throughout the day, although active animals have been seen during the daytime in winter. They leave the den in the hour following sunset and alternate periods of activity throughout the night. They are usually inactive in the early hours of the morning.

Indian Foxes are omnivorous, opportunistic feeders. Their diet consists mainly of insects (e.g. crickets, winged termites, grasshoppers, ants, beetle grubs) and spiders, small rodents, including Soft-furred Field Rats ( Millardia meltada ), field mice ( Mus booduga ), and Indian Gerbils, and birds and their eggs, including indian mynahs (Acridotheres tristis), ashy-crowned finch larks (Eremopterix grisea) and gray partridges (Francolinus pondicerianus). Other prey species include ground lizards, rat snakes (Ptyas mucuosus), hedgehogs (Paraechinus nudiventris), and Indian Hares (Lepus naigricollis). Indian Foxes feed on fruits of ber (Ziziphus spp.), neem (Azadirachta indica), mango (Mangifera indica), jambu (Syizigium cumini), banyan (Ficus bengalenss), melons,fruits, and the shoots and pods of Cicer arietum. They have also been reported eating the freshly voided pellets of sheep. They forage alone.	Endemic to the Indian subcontinent. Ranges from the foothills of the Himalayas in Nepal to the S tip of the Indian peninsula, also in Bangladesh and Pakistan .	https://zenodo.org/record/6331221/files/figure.png	In most parts of their range Indian Foxes are crepuscular and nocturnal. However, they may also hunt at middayif the temperature is mild, as on rainy days.

Generally not found in areas highly degraded by human disturbance or overgrazing. Recently, Foxes have become scarce owing to precipitous population declines. On the northern Channel Islands declines are principally a consequence of hyperpredation by golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos); on those islands the foxes are more numerous in habitats with dense cover.	Island Foxes are omnivorous and feed on a wide variety of insects, vertebrates, fruits, terrestrial molluscs, and nearshore invertebrates. The relative abundance of insects, mammals, and plant material in the diet has been found to differ by habitat type , and by island, depending upon availability of food items. For example, North American Deermouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) occur at high densities on San Miguel Island, where they constitute a large proportion of Fox diet. On Santa Cruz Island, Jerusalem crickets (Stenopelmatusfuscus) are a principal prey. The fruits of the coastal prickly pear cactus ( Opuntia littoralis ) are a principal food on San Clemente Island. Bird remains in droppings are usually occur infrequently (3- 6%), except in San Miguel Island where bird remains were found in 22% (n = 208). Island Foxes primarily forage alone, by coursing back and forth through suitable habitat patches and then moving past little-used habitats to other suitable habitat patches.			Island Foxes forage mostly at night, but also during the day.	Collins (1991a, 1991b, 1993), Collins & Laughrin (1979), Coonan (2002), Coonan & Rutz (2002), Cooper et al.

Rarely observed in densely wooded cerrado, floodplains, or dry or gallery forests.	Omnivorous, though the diet is mainly insects, particularly grounddwelling harvester termites (Synthermes spp. and Cornitermes spp.), recorded in 87% of feces across its geographical range. Dung beetles are consumed in great quantities when seasonally abundant. Other prey includes small mammals, grasshoppers, birds, and reptiles. Hoary Foxes tend to hunt as individuals or in loosely-knit pairs, with or without their juvenile offspring. Foraging group sizes of 3-5 were most common during periods of insect swarming. Hoary Foxes consume termites directly from the ground surface, or from the underside of dried cattle dung, which they flip over by pushing the dung along the ground at speed. Fox pups start eating insects at the age of at least two months. During the early rainy season, adult and young foxes catch flying ant and termite elates, as well as dung beetles.

In the west, commonly found in mixed agricultural, woodland, chaparral, riparian landscapes, and shrub habitats. In Central America, occupies forested areas and thick brush habitats, and in South America forested montane habitats. Northern Gray Foxes occur in semi-arid areas of the south-western USA and northern Mexico where cover is sufficient. They also live at the margins of some urban areas.	Omnivorous. During winter, prey consists largely of rabbits (Sylvilagus spp-) and rodents. In spring and summer it diversifies to include insects (e.g. grasshoppers), birds, and sometimes carrion. Northern Gray Foxes also feed on natural fruits and nuts, often consuming more of these foods in the fall as their availability increases.			Mostly nocturnal.

Few details of habitat preferences are known.	The Sechuran Fox is a generalist omnivore that preferentially consumesvertebrate prey or carrion when available, but often depends predominantly on seeds or seed pods. Feces collected during late winter and early spring in the inland Sechuran Desert contained mainly the remnants of undigested seeds or seed pods of algarrobo (Prosopis juliflora), zapote (Capparis scabrida) and vizcacho (C. avicennifolia). The syrupy matrix surrounding the seeds may be the actual source of nourishment. In a germination experiment, seeds recovered from feces sprouted earlier than those gathered from the ground, suggesting that the foxes not only act as seed dispersers, but affect the ability of the seeds to germinate rapidly when sporadic rains occur. Fox droppings along the coast contained crabs and several bird species. Following El Nino rains, fox droppings revealed a dramatic dietary shift to grasshoppers and mice (Paralomys gerbillus) as these prey became more abundant. In central Peru , the main summer foods were insects, scorpions (Carica candicans), fruits, and rodents. The lack of standing water in the inland desert habitat suggests that the foxes can survive without drinking. However, they may lick condensation from vegetation on foggy mornings. No food caching has been recorded.	Coastal zones of NW Peru and SW Ecuador , between 3° S and 12° S latitude.	https://zenodo.org/record/6331197/files/figure.png	Primarily nocturnal. Radio-telemetry tracking indicated that individuals emerged from their rocky daytime sleeping dens before sunset and remained active through most of the night before re-entering the dens at dawn. The phases of the moon did not influence this activity pattern, perhaps because the foxes were consuming seeds and seed pods rather than hunting. Occasionally, they are seen during the day.

It prefers open habitats, tall grass plains and sub-humid to dry habitats, but is also common in ridges, dry scrublands and open woodlands. In drier habitats in the southerly and easterly parts of its range, the speciesis replaced by the South American Gray Fox. Where its range overlaps with that of the Crab-eating Fox, the Pampas Fox selects more open areas. Apparently it has been able to adapt to the habitat alterations caused by extensive cattle breeding and agricultural activities.	Like most other medium-sized foxes, the Pampas Fox is a generalist and adaptable carnivore. Its diet shows great geographic variation and may include both wild and domestic vertebrates (particularly rodents and birds), fruit, insects, carrion, and garbage. Based on stomach contents, wild mammals and sheep appeared to be the two most common food items in Uruguay , while in La Pampa Province , Argentina , European Hares and rodents were the most common food items, followed by birds and carrion. In Buenos Aires Province , Argentina , there was a high frequency of rodents and birds, but also of insects, fruits, and crabs. Seasonal and local variations in diet are likely connected to variations in food availability. The Pampas Fox is a solitary and opportunistic carnivore. Large, highly concentrated food resources (i.e. large mammal carcasses) may cause several individuals to gather, possibly beyond the borders of normal home ranges. Food caching behavior has been observed, apparently related to an increase in the availability of rodents.			Forages both day and night, although activity is mainly nocturnal in areas with severe hunting pressure.	Barquez et al.

South American Gray Foxes generally inhabit plains and low mountains, but they have been reported to occur as high as 3500-4000 m . Although they occur in a variety of habitats, they prefer shrubby open areas. In Chile , they hunt more commonly in flat open patches of low scrub. In Chilean Patagonia, their typical habitat consists of shrubby steppe composed of coiron (Festuca spp., Stipa spp.) and nires (Nothofagus antarctica). Burning and destruction of forests for sheep farming seems to have been advantageous for these foxes. In Torres del Paine National Park, 58% of twelve individuals monitored showed preferential use of matorral shrubland or Nothofagus thicket habitat within their home ranges. In the Mendoza desert, Argentina , they prefer the lower levels of shrubby sand dunes rather than higher sections. They tolerate a variety of climates, including hot and dry areas such as the Atacama coastal desert in northern Chile (less than 2 mm average annual rainfall, 22°C mean annual temperature), the humid, temperate Valdivian forest ( 2000 mm average annual rainfall, 12°C mean annual temperature), and the cold environment of Tierra del Fuego (c. 400 mm average annual rainfall, 7°C mean annual temperature).	South American Gray Foxes are omnivorous generalists, feeding on a variety of foods, including mammals, arthropods, birds, reptiles, fruit, and carrion. Fruits ingested include berries of Cryptocarya alba and Lithraea caustica in Chile , pods of Prosopis spp., and the berry-like fruits of Prosopanche americana and of several Cactaceae in Argentina . A tendency to carnivory is apparent, however, since vertebrates, especially rodents, are reported to be the most important prey in most studies. Small mammals were the most frequently occurring vertebrate prey in most sites in the Chilean matorral and in the temperate rainforests of southern Chile . In Torres del Paine National Park, the European Hare was the most represented vertebrate prey, followed by carrion and akodontine rodents. In the Argentine Patagonian steppe, carrion was the most important food item in 42 stomachs collected in winter (representing 62% of biomass ingested), followed by hares and cricetine rodents. In Argentina’s southern Patagonia, diet also consisted primarily of carrion, followed by birds, rodents, and fruit. Diet included invertebrates, carrion, birds, and rodents in Tierra del Fuego . In the harshest habitats ofits range, the foxes’ diets include increasingly higher proportions of non-mammal food as small mammal availability decreases. Lizards were the most consumed vertebrate prey in winter, the season of lowest small mammal availability in coastal northern Chile . Small-mammal consumption decreased from autumn to summer, and fruit consumption increased. In central Chile , berries appeared in 52% of the droppings (n = 127) collected in autumn, while in spring, when small mammal availability is highest, berries were present in only 18% of the feces (n = 62). In Mendoza (Monte desert), fruit was represented in 35% of feces (n = 116), followed by small mammals (19% frequency of occurrence). Foraging occurs mostly in open areas. Although hunting groups of up to 4-5 individuals have been reported, South American Gray Foxes mostly hunt solitarily, except perhaps at the end of the breeding season, when juveniles may join the parents in search of food. In Torres del Paine National Park, the most common foraging behavior consisted of slow walking, with abrupt, irregular turns through low vegetation. The same report noted that prey appear to be located by sound, sight, and smell. Mice are captured with a sudden leap or by rapidly digging holes. Scavenging is common, as well as defecation on and around Guanaco (Lama guanicoe) and domestic goat carcasses. Caching behavior has also been reported.			Direct observations and prey activity patterns suggest that South American Gray Foxes are crepuscular, although they are commonly seen during the day. Radio-tracking showed that they were primarily nocturnal in Torres del Paine National Park, whereas they were active during both day and night in Reserva Nacional Las Chinchillas.

They inhabit dense Valdivian forest, which is very moist all year round. The forest is dominated by fruit-bearing trees in the family Mirtaceae ; there are a few native conifers and several species of broad-leaved evergreens. Radio-tracking along a gradient of disturbance on Chiloé indicated that, in decreasing order, foxes use old-growth Valdivian forest followed by secondary forest followed by pastures and openings; about 70% of home ranges comprised old-growth forest. However, when compared to the availability of each forest gradient, foxes showed preference for secondary forest and avoided old growth. On the Pacific coast of Chiloé, Darwin’s Foxes live in a fragmented environment of coastal sand dunes and dense evergreen forest. On the northern part of the island, they use a relatively flat, fragmented landscape of broadleaf forest and cow pasture. The mainland population uses dense forest; animals are found with decreasing frequency in dense monkey-puzzle tree-southern beech (Araucaria-Nothofagus spp.) forest, open Nothofagus forest and open pasture, respectively.	Omnivorous, with a broad diet, and highly opportunistic. These traits facilitate its survival in a highly fluctuating environment with low prey availability. Fecal analysis showed that the mainland population ate primarily small mammals, followed, in decreasing levels of importance, by reptiles, insects, birds, and arachnids. The proportions of these prey classes fluctuated strongly according to season. Berries were also included in the diet, occurring in about. 20% of the feces. On the mainland Darwin’s Foxes rely heavily on the seeds of monkey-puzzle trees from March to May. On Chiloé,fecal analysis revealed that insects were the most abundant food item in the diet during the warm season, followed by amphibians, mammals, birds, and reptiles; 49% offeces contained seeds. During late summer and fall, the diet was almost entirely fruits of Mirtaceae trees. Foxes may be considered a key species because of their role in dispersing the seeds of forest plants. An experiment indicated that a high percent age of the seeds of one tree species ( Amomyrtus luma ) collected from feces germinated underfield conditions. Darwin’s Foxes also eat carrion in small amounts, as evidenced by the remains (e.g. hair) of sheep, pigs, cattle, and horses in feces. Local settlers reported that lone foxes also kill Southern Pudu deer (Pudu puda; about 10 kg in weight) by biting their ankles and then the throat. In addition, coastal foxes feed on shellfish and shorebirds, and have been observed feeding on large brown algae on the beach.	Endemic to Chile , with a disjunct distribution in the forests of Chiloé Island, and on the mainland coastal mountains in Nahuelbuta National Park. Evidence of a new population was foud recently at Punta Chan Chan, N of Valdivia.	https://zenodo.org/record/6331191/files/figure.png	Darwin’s Foxes seem to concentrate their activity during the daytime in forested areas. In Nahuelbuta, they forage mainly at night, when the sympatric and larger South American Gray Fox is less active. They have also been observed hunting ducks at midday in a coastal marsh.

The Culpeo uses the entire range of habitat moisture gradients from the dry desert to broad-leaved rainforest. In the Andes of Peru , Chile , Bolivia , and Argentina it reaches elevations of up to 4800 m , where it occupies colder and dryer environments than any other South American canid.	Diet includes wild ungulates, domestic sheep (northern Patagonia), European Hares (Lepus europeus), European Rabbits, small mammals, lizards, birds, and insects. Although it is an opportunistic predator, the Culpeo is considered more carnivorous and a consumer of larger mammalian prey than the other South American foxes. Most trophic studies found seasonal differences in diet composition, probably in response to prey availability. In Argentine Patagonia, Culpeos showed a preference for hares and selected among rodent species for those that may be more vulnerable. Culpeos in central Chile selected the largest small mammals available. Although the bulk of the diet consists of animal prey, Culpeos are often described as consumers offruits and berries and are therefore thought to disperse seeds of a variety of plant species. Highest fruit consumption occurs when small mammals are the least abundant. Culpeos tend to forage solitarily. Their foraging activity may be influenced by the nocturnal habits of their main prey, but also by persecution.			In Argentina , Magallanes, and the Chilean desert, and highland Peru (where it is intensively persecuted) the Culpeo is almost completely nocturnal. This contrasts with the diurnal activity shown in north-central Chile , where it is protected. Culpeos have been recorded moving linear distances of about 7 km in north-western Patagonia, but desert-dwelling foxes in northern Chile have been recorded moving three times as far.

Recorded in a wide variety of lowland habitats, including terra firme forest, swamp forest, stands of bamboo, and primary succession along rivers. Sightings often associated with rivers and creeks, and there are reliable reports of Short-eared Dogs swimming in rivers. Records are very rare in areas with significant human disturbance, such as near towns or in agricultural areas. It is unclear whether the Short-eared Dog is able to utilize habitats outside wet lowland forests, although it has been documented at 1200 m in the Ecuadoran Andes at the edge of cloud forest.	A generalist carnivore with fish the most important item in their diet, according to one study at Cocha Cashu, Peru (presentin 28% of 21 scat samples). Insects (mainly Coleoptera ) were the second most frequently occurring item (17% of samples). Mammal remains, including agouti (Dasyprocta spp.), marsupials, and small rodents) were present in 13% ofthe scats and the remains offruits were found in 10%. Fruits of the palm Euterpe precatoria were found germinating in two scats, suggesting that Short-eared Dogs may facilitate seed dispersal for some species. Short-eared Dogs have been reported to eat fallen Brosimum fruits, and the Cofan Indians of Ecuadorreport that they are attracted to fallen bananas. Close to 4% of droppings contained the remains of frogs, including Osteocephalus taurinus, and this dietary habit is supported by independent observations elsewhere.

In the western part of the range, Corsac Foxes occur in low-grass steppe, avoiding dense and tall-grass steppes. They also occur in sandy habitats and shrubland semi-deserts, and in favorable years, in forested steppes. They avoid areas where depth of snow exceeds c. 15 cm , preferring areas where the snow is either shallower or highly compressed. Corsac Foxes appear to depend on ground squirrels (Spermophilus spp.) and marmots (Marmota spp.) for food and shelter (the burrows being enlarged and used for daytime refuge).	Generally opportunistic, with a highly variable diet throughout its range that probably changes in accordance with availability. The bulk of the diet often includes the most common rodents of an area. Birds, reptiles (lizards, snakes and young tortoises), and insects are also frequently consumed, especially in summer, as well as small amounts of vegetation (including fruit and seeds). During winter and periods of low prey abundance, scavenged Gray Wolf kills and carcasses of wild and domestic ungulates are a major source of food in some areas. Typical prey in western Siberia includes voles (Microtus gregalis, Arvicola terrestris), lemmings (Lagurus spp.), ground squirrels (Spermophilus spp.), and jerboas (Allactaga spp.) Common winter prey also often includes Arctic Hares (Lepus timidus) and birds such as gray partridges (Perdix perdix) and snow buntings (Pleptrophenax nivalis). In the forest-steppe of Kazakhstan , the diet consists primarily of lemmings and sousliks. On the Ustyurt Plateau and in Turkmenistan the main prey are gerbils ( Meriones spp. , Rhombomys opimus); in Transbaikalia and Mongolia , the main prey species are gerbils ( Meriones spp. ), jerboas (Allactaga spp. and Dipus spp.), hamsters (Cricetulus spp. and Phodopus spp.), Brandt's Voles (Lasiopodomys brandltii), Siberian Marmots (Marmota sibirica), and pikas (Ochotona spp.). The foxes are solitary foragers, although near carrion or the remains of wolf kills several Corsacs may gather together. The foxes hunt by stalking prey and making sudden short-distance attacks. They locate ground-nesting birds and other small prey by sound and smell. Despite their small size they can kill prey up to the size of young marmots, hares, ducks, pheasants, and geese.			Corsac Foxes are active mainly at night. Hunting starts in the evening and continues through the first part of the night, with a second peak of activity before dawn. Sometimes they are also active in daytime, especially during the summer months.	Allen (1938), Chirkova (1952), Geptner et al.

Found in treeless alpine meadow, alpine steppe, and desert steppe. Most of the range lies in semi-arid to arid environments with average annual precipitation of 100-500 mm , most of which occurs in summer. The climate is harsh, with temperatures reaching +30 °C in summer and dropping to —40°C in winter.	Principal diet consists of pikas (Ochotona spp.) and rodents. An analysis of 113 droppings from north-western Tibet revealed 95% Plateau Pika (Ochotona curzoniae) and small rodents (Pitymus, Alticola, and Cricetulus spp.). A further 2-7% consisted of Tibetan Antelope (Pantholops hodgsoni), probably scavenged, and the remainder was made up of insects, feathers, Ephedra berries, and other vegetation. Other reported prey items in the diet include Tibetan Woolly Hare (Lepus oiostolus), and a lizard species (Phrynocephalus spp.). Himalayan Marmot (Marmota himalayana), musk deer (Moschus sp.), Bharal (Pseudois nayaur), and livestock were present in droppings from eastern Qinghai Province , China . The foxes mainly hunt alone by trotting through or stalking in Pika colonies.

Natural habitat is dry, mixed landscape, with mosaics of scrub, woodland and farmland. They are also abundant on moorlands, mountains, deserts, sand dunes and farmland from sea level to 4500 m . Red Foxes flourish in urban areas, where they are most common in low-density residential suburbs and less common in areas dominated by industry or commerce. In many habitats, foxes appear to be closely associated with humans, even thriving in intensive agricultural areas. Also in large cities, including Washington DC , London, Paris, and Stockholm .	Adaptable and opportunistic omnivores, with a diet ranging from invertebrates (e.g. earthworms and beetles) to mammals, birds, fruit, and carrion. As predators, foxes typically kill birds and mammals up to about 3-5 kg . They cache food that is in excess of their requirements and have a highly developed memory for locations of hoards. They scavenge in rural areas (e.g. on deer and sheep carcasses in Europe and Canada , which may be the major food source in upland areas in winter), and in urban areas (on bird-feeding tables, compost heaps, and refuse). They are independent and thus generally solitary foragers, although individuals may forage in close proximity where resources are clumped.			Foraging is mainly nocturnal and crepuscular, although more diurnal where undisturbed.

It is found at elevations ranging from 400-1900 m , although Kit Foxes generally avoid rugged terrain. They use agricultural lands to some extent and can successfully inhabit urban environments.	Kit Foxes primarily consume rodents, lagomorphs, and insects. Main prey includes kangaroo rats (Dipodomys spp.), prairie dogs (Cynomys spp.), Blacktailed Jackrabbits (Lepus californicus), and cottontails (Sylvilagus spp.).

In Kansas , Swift Foxes have been found to den and forage in fallow wheat fields. Survival rates between foxes in grassland and cropland sites were not significant ly different, suggesting that Swift Foxes may be able to adapt to such habitat in some cases. The distribution and density of dens are considered important components of Swift Fox habitat requirements, particularly in terms of evading Coyote predation or Red Fox competition.	Swift Foxes are opportunistic foragers, feeding on a variety of mammals, but also birds, insects, plants, and carrion. Leporids have been reported as a primary prey item in several studies. In South Dakota , mammals accounted for 49% of prey occurrences, with Black-tailed Prairie Dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) as the primary prey item. In Kansas and Nebraska , murid rodents were the most frequently occurring prey. Insects also present, but likely to constitute only a small portion of biomass. Birds and their eggs are also consumed, as are plant materials, including prickly pear cactus fruit, wild plums, and sunflower seeds, which are consumed relatively frequently but most often in relatively small amounts.

Sub-Arctic maritime habitat in the Aleutian island chain, Bering Sea Islands, Commander Islands, and coastal Iceland .	The Arctic Fox is an opportunistic predator and scavenger. In most inland areasit is heavily dependent on fluctuating rodent populations. Main prey include Lemmings, both Lemmus spp. and Dicrostonyx spp. In Fennoscandia, L. lemmus was the main prey in summer (85% frequency of occurrence in feces) followed by birds ( Passeriformes, Galliformes, and Caridriiformes , 34%) and Reindeer (Rangifer tarandus, 21%). In winter, ptarmigan and grouse ( Lagopus spp.) are common prey, in addition to rodents and Reindeer. Changes in Fox populations have been observed to follow those of their main prey in three- to five-year cycles. Foxes living near icefree coasts have access to inland prey and also sea birds, seal carcasses, fish, and invertebrates connected to the marine environment, leading to relatively stable food availability and a more generalist strategy. In late winter and summer, foxes found in coastal Iceland feed on seabirds (Uria aalge, U. lomvia), seal carcasses, and marine invertebrates. Inland foxes rely more on Ptarmigan in winter, and migrant birds, such as geese and waders, in summer. In certain areas, foxes rely on colonies of arctic geese, which can dominate their diet locally. Arctic Foxes forage singly, presumably the most efficient foraging technique in view of the species’ main prey base of rodents and birds. When food is abundant, they cache food forlater use. Caches can contain single prey items or a variety of items, and sometimes include lemmings or goose eggs.			Arctic Foxes remain active year round. They are primarily nocturnal, but exhibit flexible activity patterns, often in accordance with main prey species.

The range of Bat-eared Foxes overlaps almost completely with that of termites of the Hodotermes and Microhodotermes genera that prevail in their diet. In East Africa Bat-eared Foxes are common in open grassland and woodland boundaries, but not on short-grass plains. Those areas occupied by Bateared Foxes usually contain more harvester termite (1. mossambicus) foraging holes and dung from migratory ungulates where beetles are likely to be found.	Insects are the primary food sources in open grassland and woodland edge habitats. Harvester termites and beetles are typically the most commonly consumed prey items. Diet is supplemented by orthopterans, beetle larvae, and ants. In open shrub savannahs, arachnids and fruit (consumed seasonally) may be among the more common food items. Small mammals, birds, eggs, and reptiles are eaten sporadically in southern Africa, but rarely in eastern Africa. There 1s seasonal variation in the proportion of particular taxa consumed: in the Serengeti dung beetles are the main source of food during the rainy season, when termite activity is reduced. When both beetles and termites are scarce, Bat-eared Foxes will dig up beetle larvae from the ground. Harvester termites and dung beetles are more abundant in areas inhabited by clusters of Bat-eared Fox families, and local differences in H. mossambicus density are inversely related to territory size. Although Fox water requirements may be met by the high water content of their insect prey or by berries during the summer, water is nevertheless a critical resource during lactation. Groups forage as a unit. Foraging techniques depend on prey type , but food is often located by walking slowly, nose close to the ground and ears cocked forward. Prey is detected mostly by sound and often excavated by digging. Foraging and feeding rates are higher when feeding on termite patches than on more dispersed insects. When feeding on termite patches, group members feed closely together, but when feeding on beetles, beetle larvae or grasshoppers, they can forage up to 200 m apart.			Changes in daily and seasonal H. mossambicus availability directly affect Bat-eared Fox activity patterns. Activity is mostly nocturnal in eastern Africa. In southern Africa, nocturnal foraging during summer gradually changes to an almost exclusively diurnal pattern in winter, in accordance with the activity changes of H. mossambicus. Diurnal foraging peaks when insect activity is highest. Bat-eared Fox groups in the Serengeti frequently patrol known Hodotermes patches in their territory after leaving the den in the evening.

In Japan , Raccoon Dog habitat includes deciduous forests, broad-leaved evergreen forests, mixed forests, farmlands, and urban areas from coastal to sub-alpine zones. In the countryside, the species prefers herbaceous habitats and is less likely to use Cryptomeria plantations throughout the year, although riparian areas are often used. In urban environments, Raccoon Dogs inhabit areas with as little as 5% forest cover. In the Russian Far East, they avoid dense forests in favor of open landscapes, especially damp meadows and agricultural land. In the introduced range, Raccoon Dogs favor moist forests and shores ofrivers and lakes, especially in early summer. In late summer and autumn they favor moist heaths with abundant berries. In the Finnish archipelago, however, they prefer barren pine forests, where they feed on crowberries (Empetrum nigrum).	Raccoon Dogs are omnivores and seasonal food habits shift as food availability changes. In most areas small rodents form the bulk of their diet in all seasons. Frogs, lizards, invertebrates, insects (including adults and larvae of Orthoptera, Coleoptera, Hemiptera, Diptera, Lepidoptera, Odonata ), and birds and their eggs are also consumed, especially in early summer. Plants are eaten frequently; berries and fruits serve as an important and favored food source in late summer and autumn, when Raccoon Dogs decrease their food intake before entering winter dormancy. Oats, sweet corn, watermelon, and other agriculture products often are found in Raccoon Dog stomachs. Carrion, fish, and crustaceans are consumed when available. As opportunistic generalists, Raccoon Dogs forage by searching close to the ground and may also climb trees for fruits. They mainly forage in pairs, usually wandering some distance from each other.			Mainly nocturnal, leaving their dens 1-2 hours after sunset. When they have pups, females also forage during the daytime while the male is babysitting. In spring, Raccoon Dogs are also seen during daytime when sunbathing on south-facing slopes ofhills. In areas where winters are harsh they enter a form of hibernation (winter lethargy) in November and become active again in March. The Raccoon Dog is the only canid known to hibernate.

Tends to avoid open savannah, thickly wooded areas, and arid zones, but does enter the equatorial forest belt in the wake of human settlement. Side-striped Jackals frequently occur near rural dwellings and farm buildings, and penetrate suburban and urban areas. Where Side-striped Jackals occur sympatrically with Golden and Black-backed Jackals, they may avoid competition by ecological segregation. In such areas of sympatry, Side-striped Jackals usually occupy areas of denser vegetation, and Black-backed and Golden Jackals dominate in the more open areas.	Omnivorous, with a diet that is responsive to both seasonal and local variation in food availability. On commercial farmland in the Zimbabwe highveld, they eat mainly wild fruit (30%) and small (less than 1 kg ) to medium-sized (more than 1 kg ) mammals (27% and 23%, respectively). The remainder of their diet comprises birds, invertebrates, cattle cake, grass, and carrion. In wildlife areas of western Zimbabwe , Side-stripedJackals feed largely on invertebrates during the wet season and small mammals up to the size of Spring hares (Pedetes capensis) during the dry months of the year. They scavenge extensively from safari camp rubbish dumps and occasionally from large carnivore kills (although they are often out-competed for this resource by Black-backed Jackals). In the Ngorongoro Crater, Side-striped Jackals have been recorded competing with Black-backed Jackals for Grant's Gazelle (Nanger granti) fawns. Their diet may consist exclusively of certain fruits when in season. Apparently less predatory than other jackals, although according to one authority this may not hold when prey is highly available. The species forages solitarily, although in western Zimbabwe family groups have been observed feeding together on abundant resources, and as many as twelve have been counted at kills or scavenging offal outside towns. Jackals have been described foraging opportunistically, exploiting food-rich habitats by random walks, and they display an amazing ability to find food where none seems obvious to the human observer.

These range from the Sahel to the evergreen forests of Myanmar and Thailand . Golden Jackals occupy semi-desert, short to medium grasslands and savannahs in Africa, and forested, mangrove, agricultural, rural, and semi-urban habitats in India and Bangladesh . Golden Jackals are opportunistic and will venture into human habitation at night to feed on garbage. They have been recorded at elevations of 3800 m in the Bale Mountains of Ethiopia and are well established around hill stations at 2000 m in India .	An omnivorous and opportunistic forager, the Golden Jackal’s diet varies according to season and habitat. According to one study in east Africa, although they consume invertebrates and fruit, over 60% of Golden Jackal diet consisted of rodents, lizards, snakes, birds (from quail to flamingoes), hares, and Thomson's Gazelle (Eudorcas thomsoni). In India , over 60% of the diet comprised rodents, birds, and fruit in Bharatpur, while in Kanha over 80% ofthe diet consisted of rodents, reptiles, and fruit. In Sariska Tiger Reserve, India , scat analysis (n = 36) revealed that Golden Jackal diet included mainly mammals (45% occurrence, of which 36% was rodents), vegetable matter (20%), birds (19%), and reptiles and invertebrates (8% each). Golden Jackals often ingest large quantities of vegetable matter, and during the fruiting season in India they feed intensively on the fruits of Ziziphus sp., Carissa carvanda, Syzigium cuminii, and pods of Prosopis juliflora and Cassia fistula. Single jackals typically hunt smaller prey like rodents, hares, and birds. They use their hearing to locate rodents in the grass and then leap in the air and pounce on them; they also dig out Indian Gerbils (7atera indica) from their burrows. They have been observed to hunt young, old, and infirm ungulates that are sometimes 4-5 times their body weight. Although Golden Jackals are able to hunt alone, cooperative hunting in small packs of 2—4 individuals is often more successful and permits them to kill larger prey, including antelope fawns and langur monkeys (Presbytis pileata and P. entellus). Groups of 5-18 Golden Jackals have been sighted scavenging on carcasses of large ungulates, and there is a report of similar aggregations on clumped food resources in Israel . In several areas of India and Bangladesh , jackals subsist primarily by scavenging on carrion and garbage. They also cache food.	Widespread in N and NE Africa, occurring from Senegal on the W coast of Africa to Egypt in the E, in a range that includes Morocco , Algeria , Tunisia , and Libya in the N to Nigeria , Chad , and Tanzania in the S. They have expanded their range from the Arabian Peninsula into Western Europe, to Bulgaria , Austria , and NE Italy and E into Turkey , Syria , Iraq , Iran , Central Asia, the entire Indian subcontinent, then E and S to Sri Lanka , Myanmar , Thailand , and parts of Indochina.	https://zenodo.org/record/6331171/files/figure.png	Golden Jackals are mainly nocturnal, but have flexible activity patterns and may be active during the day. During Blackbuck (Antilope cervicapra) calving peaks in Velavadar National Park, India , for example, jackals were observed searching throughout the day for calves in hiding, searches intensifying during the early morning and late evening.

Suitable habitats are above the tree-line, from about 3200 to 4500 m , with some wolves present in montane grasslands at 3000 m . However, subsistence agriculture extends up to 3500-3800 m in many areas, restricting the wolves to higher ranges. Rainfall at high altitude varies between 1000 and 2000 mm /year, with one pronounced dry period from December to February/March. Wolves utilize all Afro-alpine habitats, but prefer open areas with short herbaceous and grassland communities where rodents are most abundant, along flat or gently sloping areas with deep soils and poor drainage in parts. Prime habitats in the Bale Mountains are characterized by short herbs (Alchemilla spp.) and grasses, and low vegetation cover, a community maintained in continuous succession as a result of Ethiopian African Mole Rat (Tachyoryctes macrocephalus) burrowing activity. Other good habitats include tussock grasslands (Festuca spp., Agrostis spp.), high-altitude shrubs dominated by Helichrysum spp., and short grasslands in shallow soils. In northern parts of the range, plant communities characterized by a matrix of “guassa” tussock grasses (Festuca spp.), “cherenfi” bushes (Euryops pinifolius) and giant lobelias (Lobelia rhynchopetalum) sustain high rodent abundance and are preferred by wolves. Ericaceous moorlands (Erica and Phillipia spp.) at 3200-3600 m are of marginal value, whereas open moorlands containing patches of herbs and grasses offer relatively good habitat.	Ethiopian Wolves feed almost exclusively upon diurnal rodents of the high-altitude Afro-alpine grassland community. In the Bale Mountains, diurnal rodents accounted for 96% of all prey occurrences in feces, with 87% belonging to three Bale endemic species: the Ethiopian African Mole Rat ( 300-930 g ), Blick’s Grass Rat ( Arvicanthis blicki ), and the Black-clawed Brush-furred Rat ( Lophuromys melanonyx ). Other prey species include the Ethiopian Vlei Rat ( Otomys typus ), Ethiopian Buff-spotted Brush-furred Rat ( Lophuromys flavopunctatus ), Ethiopian Highland Hare (Lepus starcki), and occasionally goslings and eggs. On occasion, wolves were observed feeding on Rock Hyrax (Procavia capensis), and young of Bush Duiker (Sylvicapra grimmia), Common Reedbuck (Redunca redunca), and Mountain Nyala (Tragelaphus buxtoni). Sedge leaves (Carex monostachya) are occasionally ingested, probably to assist digestion or control parasites. Where the Ethiopian African Mole Ratis absent (i.e. Gaysay montane grassland in Bale and Menz), it is replaced in the wolf diet by the smaller Northeast African Mole Rat (Tachyoryctes splendens). Similarly, in northern Ethiopia Arvicanthis abyssinicus and Lophuromysflavopunctatus replace their respective endemic relatives (A. blickiand L. melanonyx) from Bale. Elsewhere, O. typus , a rare prey item in Bale and Menz, was identified as the commonest prey in droppings collected in the otherfive populations. The same study confirmed that wolves are specialized hunters of diurnal rodents throughout their distribution, but that there is also some degree of variation in diet composition along climatic-induced gradients. Although the Ethiopian Wolfis primarily a solitary rodent hunter, it can also hunt cooperatively. Occasionally, small packs have been seen chasing young antelopes, lambs, and hares and making kills. Ethiopian Wolves will take carrion or feed on carcasses; in fact, a sheep carcass is the most successful bait for attracting wolves. The local name “jedalla farda”—the horse’s Jjackal—refers to wolves’ habit of following mares and cows about to give birth so they can eat the afterbirth. In areas of grazing in Bale, wolves were often seen foraging among herds ofcattle, a tactic that may aid in ambushing rodents out oftheir holes, by using the herd as a mobile hide. Wolves carefully explore rich food patches by walking slowly and pausing frequently to investigate holes or to localize the rodents by means of their excellent hearing. Once the prey is located they move with short, stealthy steps alternating with short periods of immobility, sometimes with belly pressed flat to the ground. The quarry is grabbed with the mouth after a short dash. A stalk can last from seconds to up to an hour, especially if the quarry is an Ethiopian African Mole Rat. Occasionally, wolves run in zig-zag through rat colonies, grabbing the rodents in passing. Digging prey out is common and is the favored technique to catch Ethiopian African Mole Rats. In such cases, hunting effort varies from a few scratches at a rat hole to the total destruction of a set of burrows, leaving mounds of earth often up to one meter high. Sometimes, digging serves to reach a nest of grassrats. Kills are often cached and later retrieved.			In Bale, wolves are mostly diurnal. Packs congregate for social greetings and border patrols at dawn, around midday and in the evening, and rest together at night, but break up to forage individually in the morning and early afternoon. Peaks of foraging activity suggest a synchronization with the aboveground activity of rodents. There is little nocturnal activity, wolves seldom moving far from their evening resting site. They may become more crepuscular and nocturnal where human interference 1s severe.	Ashenafi et al. (2005), Clutton-Brock et al. (1976), Gottelli & Sillero-Zubiri (1992), Gottelli, Marino et al.

Their ability to exploit human resources also allows them to occupy urban areas. Water availability may limit distribution in some desert environments.	Opportunistic, generalist predators that eat a wide variety of food items, ranging from fruit and insects to small mammals to large ungulates and live-stock, typically consuming items in relation to availability. Livestock and wild ungulates are often consumed as carrion, but predation on large ungulates (native and domestic) does occur. Predation on neonates of native ungulates can be high during fawning. Coyotes in suburban areas are adept at exploiting human-made food resources and will readily consume refuse, pet food or other human-related items. Studies of predatory behavior show that Coyote age, habitat, and wind and snow conditions all influence their ability to capture small mammals. Coyotes hunt small mammals alone, even when pack size is large. When preying on native ungulates, cooperation among pack members may facilitate the capture of prey, but is not essential. Environmental factors are important to the success of an attack on adult ungulates, as is the presence of the alpha Coyote pair, and younger animals generally do not participate. The number of Coyotes is not as important as which individuals are involved in the attack. The outcome is also affected by the ability of the quarry to escape into water, its defensive abilities, and its nutritional state. In areas with an ungulate prey base in winter, competition with other sympatric carnivores for a carcass may be intense and there can even be competition among members of the same pack.			Coyotes may be active throughout the day, but they tend to be more active during the early morning and around sunset. Activity patterns change seasonally (e.g. during winter, when there is a change in the food base in some areas) or in response to human disturbance and persecution.

Given their wide historical distribution, Red Wolves probably utilized a large suite of habitat types at one time. The last naturally occurring population utilized the coastal prairie marshes of south-western Louisiana and south-eastern Texas . However, many agree that this environment probably does not typify preferred Red Wolf habitat. There is evidence that the species was found in highest numbers in the once extensive bottomland river forests and swamps of the South-east . Red wolves reintroduced into North Carolina , and their descendants, have made extensive use of habitat types ranging from agricultural lands to pocosins, which are forest/wetland mosaics with an understory of evergreen shrubs. This suggests that Red Wolves are habitat generalists and can thrive in most settings where prey populations are adequate and persecution by humans is slight. This generalization is supported by one study in which low human density, wetland soil type , and distance from roads were the most important predictors of potential wolf habitat in North Carolina .	Mammals such as Coypu (Myocastor coypus), rabbits (Sylvilagus spp.), and rodents (Sigmodon hispidus, Oryzomys palustris, Ondatra zibethicus) are common in south-eastern Texas and appear to have been the primary prey of Red Wolves historically. Presently in North Carolina , White-tailed Deer (Odocoileus virginianus), Northern Raccoons, and rabbits are the primary prey species for the reintroduced population (86% of the diet). While it is not uncommon for Red Wolves to forage individually, there is also evidence of group hunting by pack members. Also, resource partitioning among members of a pack sometimes occurs. In one study of pack feeding, rodents were consumed more by juveniles than adults, and use of rodents diminished as the young wolves matured.	Red Wolves exist only as a reintroduced population in E North Carolina , USA .	https://zenodo.org/record/6331163/files/figure.png	Mostly nocturnal with crepuscular peaks of activity. Hunting usually occurs at night or at dawn and dusk.

In west Asia and north-east Africa present in very arid environments. Dingoes are found in all habitats from tropical alpine moorlands to tropical wetlands and forests to arid hot deserts.	Extremely variable, but main prey consists of large ungulates (Moose Alces sp., Reindeer Rangifer tarandus , deer, Wild Boar Sus scropha, etc.). Gray Wolves will also eat smaller prey items, livestock, carrion, and garbage. In winter, they hunt in packs, but in summer they hunt singly, in pairs, or in small groups. Chases ranging from 100 m to more than 5 km are the rule. Generally Gray Wolves end up with, or tend to select, older individuals, juveniles (under 1 year) or debilitated animals, or those in otherwise poor condition. Average daily food consumption varies from 2-5-6- 3 kg or more per day, and kill rates vary accordingly. Wolvesfirst attack the rump of larger prey, but the head, shoulders, flanks, or rump of smaller prey. Usually they eat most of the carcass, leaving only the larger bones and chunks of hide. When there is surplus food, wolves will cache either regurgitated chunks or large pieces. Dingoes, eat a diverse range of prey types and over 170 species have been identified ranging from insects to buffalo, with the main prey in Australia composed of magpie geese (Anseranas semipalmata), Agile Wallabies (Macropus agilis), Red Kangaroos (Macropus rufus); Wallaroos (Macropus robustus), wallabies (Wallabia bicolor, Macropus rufogriseus), possums (Trichosurus vulpecula, Pseudocheirus peregrinus), Common Wombats (Vombatus ursinus), European Rabbits ( Oryctolagus cuniculus ), rodents (Rattus villosisimus, R. colletti, Mus musculus) and lizards ( Ctenophorus nuchalis ). In Asia, Dingoes live commensally with humans in most regions and their main food items are rice, fruit, and other table scraps provided by people or scavenged.			Mostly nocturnal or crepuscular, but activity periods may extend well into daylight hours in areas where they are free from persecution. Predominantly diurnal in the Arctic summer.

Records up to 3000 m . Readily adapts to deforestation, agricultural and horticultural development(e.g. sugarcane, eucalyptus, melon, pineapples), and habitats in regeneration. In the arid Chaco regions of Bolivia , Paraguay , and Argentina , confined to woodland edge. Vegetative habitats generally utilized in proportion to abundance, varying with individual fox’s social status and climatic season. Radio-tagged foxes in seasonally flooded savannas of Marajo, Brazil , preferred wooded savannah and regenerating scrub. In the central Llanos of Venezuela , fox home ranges were generally located in open palm savannah (68% of sightings) and closed habitats (shrub, woodlands, deciduous forest, 32% of sightings). The foxes shifted to higher ground in response to seasonal flooding. In Minas Gerais , Brazil , two radio-tagged foxes were observed most often at the interface of livestock pasture and gallery forest “vereidas” and less frequently in eucalyptus/agricultural plantations (8%).	Omnivorous: diet includes fruit, vertebrates, insects, amphibians, crustaceans, birds, and carrion. An opportunistic predator; diet at any one location varies according to availability, season, and probably social status. In areas of human disturbance, a large proportion of the diet may comprise foods such as cultivated fruits, domestic fowl, and refuse. In the Venezuelan Llanos, the percent volume of food items from the contents of 104 fox stomachs from four different locations included: small mammals (26%), fruit (24%), amphibians (13%), insects (11%); the dry season diet was predominantly small mammals, reptiles, and amphibians, with insect and fruit becoming more frequent in the wet season. In one Venezuelan location, land crabs (Dilocarcinus spp.) were the most frequently occurring dietary item in the rainy season, and in the Ibera Wetlands ( Corrientes , Argentina ), aquatic birds were identified in 87% of 23 fox scats collected in the vicinity of a bird breeding colony. Vertebrates were the most frequently encountered food item (69%) of 74 prey items identified in 22 scats collected at elevations of above 2600 m in the eastern Colombian Andes, but were the least favored food item (15%) in feces collected from the lowland wooded savannahs of Marajo ( Brazil ), where cultivated and wild fruit (57%) and insects (86%) were more frequently encountered. Crab-eating Foxes hunt individually, but most commonly as pairs; 1-3 adultsized offspring may accompany them. Cooperative hunting apparently is rare. They will tolerate close proximity when foraging on concentrated, easily available food items such as turtle eggs, fruit, insects (e.g. termites), and sizeable carrion (e.g. goat carcass). The young start to hunt with the parents at about six weeks of age. Hunting strategies include spring-pouncing to capture vertebrates, ground-level lateral head movements to snatch insects, and directional maneuvers in pursuit of land crabs. The foxes in Marajo deliver a series of shoulder blows, with face up-turned, to some food items (e.g. toads, eggs) prior to comsuming them. In the same region, foxes search for and consume small stones from specific open gravel sites, presumably as a source of minerals. Foxes cache food items but do not regularly urine-mark them. They probably act as seed dispersers of a range of wild and cultivated plant species, as indicated by the presence of germinating seeds in their scats. Examples include Acacia aroma and Celtis tala (montane Chaco , Argentina ), Butia capitata ( Uruguay ), Hovenia dulcis (Iguacu National Park, Brazil ), Ficus spp. (south-eastern Brazil ), Psidium guineense, Humiria balsamifera, and Anacardium occidentale (Amazonian Brazil ).

Bush Dogs have been observed in lowland (below 1500 m ) forested habitats, including primary and gallery forest, semi-deciduous forest, and seasonally flooded forest. Observations have also been recorded from cerrado habitat in Brazil and Paraguay and pampas (wet savannah) edge/riparian areas, and as far as 5700 m from forest habitat. Occasionally reported from secondary forest, ranchland, and fragmented cerrado ranchland.	Primarily carnivorous, Bush Dogs mainly hunt large rodents such as Lowland Pacas and agoutis (Dasyprocta spp.). Their diet often includes other small mammals (e.g. rats, Oryzomys spp. and Proechimys spp., rabbits, Sylvilagus brasiliensis, opossums, Didelphis spp. and the Nine-banded Armadillo Dasypus novemcinctus ). Other prey items include teju lizards (Tupinambis sp.), snakes, and possibly ground-nesting birds. Bush Dogs can engage in group hunting to take prey considerably larger than themselves, such as Capybaras (Hydrochoeris hydrochaeris), and rheas (Rhea americana), deer (Mazama spp.), and even South American Tapir (Tapirus terrestris). Bush Dogs hunt in packs of 2-8 animals (mean 4-5) employing a variety of cooperative hunting strategies. Prey is pursued relentlessly by the pack, even into deep water. In Bolivia the dogs hunt Mazama deer by attacking the legs until the animaltires and falls. Olfaction may play a large role when foraging. Some individuals may enter the burrow of a prey species while other pack members wait at possible escape routes.			Mostly diurnal; the pair and any family members spend the night in a den.

Some evidence indicates that they may prefer areas with low to medium shrub density. Maned Wolves are also seen in cultivated areas and pastures. Daytime resting areas include gallery forests, cerrado, and marshy areas near rivers. There is some evidence that they can utilize cultivated land for hunting and resting, but additional studies are essential to quantify how well the species tolerates intensive agricultural activity.	Omnivorous, consuming principally fruits and small- to mediumsized vertebrates. Numerous studies document a broadly varied diet of c. 50% plant and c. 50% animal material. The fruit Solanum lycocarpum grows throughout much of the range and is a primary food source; other important items include small mammals ( Caviidae , Muridae, Echimydae ) and armadillos ( Dasypodidae ), other fruits ( Annonaceae , Myrtaceae, Palmae , Bromeliaceae , and others), birds ( Tinamidae , Emberizidae , and others), reptiles, and arthropods. Although the frequency of plant and animal items found in fecal samples is approximately equal, the biomass of animal items is usually greater than that of plant items. Certain items, such as rodents and Solanum, are consumed year round, but diet varies with food availability. At least occasionally, Pampas Deer (Ozotoceros bezoarticus) are also consumed. In one study, deer occurred in 2:4% of 1673 fecal samples analyzed. Strategies for hunting animal prey include stalking with a final pounce, digging after burrowing animals, leaping into the air to capture flying birds and insects, and sprinting after fleeing deer. Approximately 21% of all hunting attempts end with the successful capture of prey, and the strategies do not differ in their success rates. Maned Wolves have been recorded feeding on Coypu that were caught in traps set by hunters, and have been observed scavenging opportunistically on road-kill carcasses.

Early studies in Tanzania’s Serengeti led to a belief that Wild Dogs were primarily an open-plains species, but they reach their highest densities in thicker bush (e.g. central Tanzania , western Zimbabwe and northern Botswana ). Several relict populations also occupy dense upland forest (e.g. Harenna Forest, Ethiopia ; Ngare Ndare Forest, Kenya ). Wild Dogs have been recorded in desert, although they appear unable to expand into the southern Kalahari or into montane habitats; they occur in some lowland forest areas. It appears that their current distribution is limited primarily by human activities and the availability of prey, rather than the loss of a specific habitat type .	Wild Dogs mostly hunt medium-sized antelope. In most areas their principal prey are Impala, Greater Kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros), Thomson's Gazelle, and Blue Wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus). They will give chase to larger species, such as Common Eland (7Tragelaphus oryx) and African Buffalo (Syncerus caffer), but rarely kill these species. Warthogs (Phacochoerus spp.), dik-diks (Madoqua spp.), Steenbok (Raphicerus campestris), and duikers (Cephalophini) are important prey items in some areas. African Wild Dogs also take small prey opportunistically, such as hares, lizards, and bird eggs, but these make a very small contribution to their diet. African Wild Dogs live and hunt in packs. Hunts appear to be highly coordinated and are often preceded by a “social rally”. During chases, African Wild Dogs may run at speeds of up to 60 km /h, and are specially adapted to cope with the heat stress that this involves. After one dog has made the first grab of an antelope or other prey species, other pack members join and help drag the quarry to the ground. In some hunts, one pack member may restrain the head of the prey by biting its nose and holding on while others make the kill. Individuals may also chase and bring down prey alone. Hunting success is high in comparison with other large carnivore species (e.g. in the Serengeti, 70% of 133 African Wild Dog hunts ended in a kill). Social hunting gives each pack member a higher foraging success rate (measured as kg killed per km chased) relative to hunting alone. African Wild Dogs very rarely scavenge.	Other populations occur in Central African Republic , Ethiopia , Kenya , Mozambique , Namibia , South Africa , Sudan , and Zambia . Potential small populations (less than 100 individuals) may exist in Cameroon , Chad , Senegal , and Somalia .	https://zenodo.org/record/6331179/files/figure.png	African Wild Dogs are mainly crepuscular and hunt during the early morning and early evening hours. They may also hunt occasionally at night when moonlight is ample. Activity appears to be limited by ambient temperature and availability of light.

They are not recorded from desert regions. In India , tropical dry and moist deciduous forest may represent optimal habitats, based on the regions thought to hold the largest Dhole populations. Ungulate biomass, particularly that of cervid species, is highest in these vegetation types when compared to others in the same region. Important factors that may influence habitat selection include the availability of medium to large ungulate prey species, water, the presence of other large carnivore species, human population levels, and suitability of breeding sites (i.e. in terms of proximity to water, presence of suitable boulder structures, and sufficient prey).	Diet includes beetles, rodents, birds, and occasionally grass and other plants like many other canids. However, Dholes hunt mainly vertebrate prey, with a preference for medium to large ungulates. They are also known to scavenge and occasionally have been observed eating carrion (e.g. Asian Elephant (Elephas maximus) and Gaur (Bos frontalis) carcasses). It has been suggested that such scavenging only occurs during periods of prey scarcity, particularly during the dry season. Grass is ingested, but may serve an anti-helminthic function rather than a nutritional one. Dholes are communal hunters, occasionally forming packs of over 30 animals, but are more often found in hunting groups of fewer than ten animals. Depending on prey availability, Dholes may also hunt alone or in pairs, taking smaller prey such as deer fawns or hares. During hunts, some Dholes may lie in ambush while others drive prey towards them. Dholes often drive deer into water, where they swim out to surround and capture them. It is common for certain individuals to take particular roles in the hunt, such as leading the chase or taking the first grab at the prey.			Primarily a crepuscular forager, but can hunt at any time of the day or night.	Clutton-Brock et al. (1976), Cohen (1977, 1978), Davidar (1973, 1975), Durbin (1998), Durbin et al.

In general they show a preference for open habitats, tending to avoid dense vegetation. In KwaZulu-Natal , South Africa , they are recorded from sea level to more than 3000 m in the Drakensberg Mountains, and in localities receiving more than 2000 mm of rainfall. Where more than one jackal species occurs in sympatry the selection of habitat is partitioned. Black-backed Jackals preferentially use either open grassland (when sympatric with Side-striped Jackal) or wooded savannah (when sympatric with Golden and Side-striped Jackals). In western Zimbabwe , habitat partitioning was mediated by aggressive encounters in which Blackbacked Jackals displaced Side-striped Jackals from grassland habitats.	Generalist feeders. Diet varies according to food availability. When the jackals occur in sympatry with other carnivores using the same prey base, food resources are partitioned. Dietary items typically include small- to medium-sized mammals (e.g. murids, spring hares, young ungulates), reptiles, birds and bird eggs, carrion, and human refuse, as well as invertebrates and plants. In coastal areas, Black-backed Jackals will eat beached marine mammals, seals, fish, and mussels. Invertebrates such as termites and insects are also commonly eaten. Pairs and small groups are often seen foraging together. Groups of between eight and ten aggregate at large carcasses of herbivores, and more than 80 have been recorded at seal colonies on the Namib Desert coast. Such aggregations are accompanied by aggressive behavior between territorial individuals. However, in the south-western Kalahari, where antelope carcasses are uncommon, groups of up to 15 pairs can feed in succession without much overt aggression. Matedjackal pairs will often cooperate in the capture of prey, resulting in a higher success rate. In Botswana , they occasionally form “packs” in order to hunt adult Impala (Aepyceros melampus), and there are also records of their taking adult antelope. On the Namib Desert coast they patrol beaches for beached marine refuse and move along sheltered paths between food-rich patches; the tops of coastal hummocks are used as feeding sites. In this environment, they frequently follow Brown Hyenas (Parahyaena brunnea), from a distance in the hope of securing the odd food item. Their large, mobile ears are used to locate invertebrate and small mammalian prey, which are then captured with a leap followed by an accurate pounce, in a similar manner to Red Foxes.			Mostly nocturnal, but activity periods may extend well into daylight hours in areas where they are free from persecution.	Avery et al.

Roosts of Livingstone’s Flying Foxes are predominantly found in Ficus exasperata and FE lutea ( Moraceae ); Gyrostipula comorensis ( Rubiaceae ); and especially Gambeya spp. ( Sapotaceae ) and Nuxia pseudodentata ( Stilbaceae ). Roosts are in steep-sided (30-50°) valleys with south-east facing slopes, suggesting that they are sensitive to wind and sun.	Livingstone’s Flying Fox is primarily frugivorous, eating fruits of native trees but also nectar and leaves. Ficus antandronarumis preferred during wet season and F lutea during dry season; other foods come from at least 14 genera in 13 families. Flowers of Gyrostipula and Neonauclea ( Rubiaceae ) and flowers, nectar, and to a lesser extent unripe fruit of Ceiba ( Malvaceae ) are eaten. Captive bats caught and ate insects.	Comoro Is ( Anjouan and Mohéli ).		Livingstone’s Flying Foxes forage at night. During the day, they remain in roosts and bask and stretch their wings in the sun to warm up, or urinate on their wings while flapping them to cool down. They take advantage of afternoon thermals to soar long distances. Peak activity is between 22:00 h and 02:00 h, and it declines to ¢.04:00 h. They start urinating immediately after taking flight.

Roosting habitat of Lyle’s Flying Fox can be in close proximity to human settlements, with marked preference (53% of roosts) for trees growing in Buddhist temples, and is usually near watercourses.	Liyle’s Flying Fox is primarily frugivorous. In Thailand ,it eats fruits of 34 plant genera, predominantly figs ( Ficus , Moraceae ) and cultivated plants in orchards. Plants visited for flowers and leaves include Acacia (Fabaceae) , Eucalyptus ( Myrtaceae ), and Markhamia ( Bignoniaceae ). Lyle’s Flying Foxes ingest ¢.50% their body weight/day. It is an important seed disperser and a central-place forager that returns to the same roosts after foraging.	S Thailand , S Cambodia , and S Vietnam around Gulf of Thailand , entering inland C Cambodia . Single specimen recorded in Yunnan ( China ) considered alien.		Lyle’s Flying Foxes are crepuscular and nocturnal. They leave day roosts in the evening to forage and return in early morning (03:00-05:00 h). Lunar phase had no influence on timing of colony-wide emergence; during breeding season, females were the last to emerge. During daytime, sleeping, grooming, and wing flapping are the most frequent behaviors of roosting bats. Wing spreading, movement, and courtship are more frequent in males than females; the opposite is true for grooming and antagonistic behaviors.	Almeida et al.

The Greater Musky Fruit Bat is abundant in primary forests and common in secondary forests and disturbed/degraded forest areas. It occurs less commonly in urban areas (e.g. parks in Manila ).	The Greater Musky Fruit Bat is primarily frugivorous but also eats leaves and flower products. On Panay Island, fruit from 39 genera in 28 families were eaten. Flowers from four genera in four families and leaves from seven genera in five families were used as food. Leaves used are rich in protein and other nutrients and minerals but less so than control leaves of non-used species, but used species average less in deterrent compounds like phenols. Several feeding areas are visited with high fidelity each night in a predictable fashion, indicative of trap-lining feeding behavior. Individuals fly around fruiting trees and land briefly to pluck a single fruit, which is taken to a feeding roost located 10-50 m from the fruiting tree. Ripe fruit is detected by smell and is preferred over unripen fruit. Fruit is eaten and dry pellets dropped; fresh droppings from ten or more figs indicate that this foraging pattern is repeated throughout a night. Small fig seeds that are not parasitized by fig wasps survive digestion and are defecated intact.	Philippines (except Palawan faunal region), also present in the Batanes /Babuyan faunal region ( Camiguin I) and the Greater Sulu faunal region (Bongao and Sanga-Sanga Is).		Each night males and females leave their day roosts and visit at least two small (less than 1 ha) foraging areas. They spend most of their time near productive feeding areas and commute among them. The Greater Musky Fruit Bat frequently flies over water and roosts in tree cavities in primary forests.	Andersen (1912b), Giannini & Simmons (2007a), Heaney, Balete et al.

Leschenault’s Rousette seems very sensitive to human-induced habitat disturbance and to prefer high relative humidity in roosting sites.	L.eschenault’s Rousette is frugivore but also feeds on nectar, pollen, and leaves. It consumes fruits of from at least 18 genera in 13 families; only near ripe and ripe fruits are eaten. Leschenault’s Rousette also consumed leaves of Beilschmiedia purpurascens ( Lauraceae ) and nectar of Ceiba ( Malvaceae ) and Musa ( Musaceae ). Captive experiments showed that odor might act as the primary food cue when foraging. Leschenault’s Rousettes usually forage alone. Leschenault’s Rousettes disperse randomly to forage in nearby forests (Northern Western Ghats). Mist net captures were 2-23- 5 m high, with upper canopy preferred.			Leschenault’s Rousettes emerge from roosts late in the evening in groups of a few individuals. Foraging time pattern is influenced by moon phase. Navigation is accomplished with echolocation using single and double tongue clicks, with simple clicks emitted either in beginning or end ofclick sequences. Simple brief impulsive clicks and reduction in interpulse interval when approaching walls suggest a good ability to avoid obstacles, similar to that of laryngeal echolocating bats. Leschenault’s Rousettes roost in natural caves but might also use man-made structures (e.g. dam tunnels).	Aeshita et al.

Populations of Egyptian Rousettes in arid areas of northern Africa and the Middle East have a patchy distribution in human-altered areas with increased roost and food availability.	The Egyptian Rousette feeds mostly on soft fruits from at least twelve genera of native species (e.g. Ficus , Moraceae ) in nine families and introduced species including cultivated Rosaceae (e.g. plum, loquat, and apple) and Rutaceae ( Citrus ). After fruits have been collected from trees, individuals often use other trees as feeding roosts. Adults consume 50-150% of their body weight daily. Consumption increases for pregnant and lactating females to meet increased nutritional demands. Egyptian Rousettes forage in groups. They might also feed on flowers, occasionally leaves, and even insects. Feeding on insects has been inferred by analyses offeces,saliva, and stomach contents and with direct observation. Egyptian Rousettes deliberately forage for insects; in an urban setting in South Africa , they foraged for and consumed garden fruit chafers (Pachnoda sinuata, Coleoptera), alternating with consumption of figs that were also available in the same area. Efficient glucose absorption by the intestine happens mostly through passive paracellular absorption. Olfaction plays an important role in finding and selecting food. In its Mediterranean distribution, Egyptian Rousettes are viewed as agricultural pests in commercial orchards.			Egyptian Rousettes leave their roosts to feed every night. Activity initiates after sunset and ends before sunrise. A study in South Africa showed that the period of activity in summeris longer than in winter when start of activity is a little delayed and individuals return earlier to roosts. The Egyptian Rousette typically roosts in caves but also uses different types of holes and crevices including artificial ones (tombs, temples, mines, tunnels, etc.). This habit is facilitated by its echolocation abilities. Species of Rousettus are able to use echolocation, accomplished by tongue clicking. Egyptian Rousette calls last 140-250 microseconds and allow individuals to detect and avoid, experimentally, 6-mm wires. Echolocation is used in light and dark conditions.

Ficus sp. ( Moraceae ) seeds were found in feces in March-April, and individuals were captured near fruiting fig trees. Feeding observation in captivity showed that Madagascan fruit bats feed on fruits that they consume by ingesting fruit juice and pulp and spitting out the fiber. They preferred lipid- and calcium-rich fruits, and fruits of no commercial value over commercially important ones. Nectar appears to be an important dietary element; bats have been observed feeding on kapok flowers ( Ceiba , Malvaceae ) and on nectar of banana flowers.

Hammer-headed Fruit Bats use riverine forests as corridors into woodland savannas.	The Hammer-headed Fruit Batis frugivorous and can commute up to 10 km between roosts and feeding areas in forests, second growth, or old plantations, where it primarily feeds on fruits in canopies. Females, non-adults, and nondisplaying males forage during the entire night along regular routes; they search for low-quality and continuously available fruits (e.g. Anthocleista , Gentianaceae ). Sexually active males start to forage late at night, feeding mainly on higher-quality fruits of Ficus ( Moraceae ). Otherfruits are eaten from at least eleven plant genera and ten families, along with many cultivated fruits. Fruits are taken in the mouth and carried to a nearby tree, where they are squeezed for juice. Observations of Hammer-headed Fruit Bats attacking and eating chickens, scraps of meat, and skinned carcasses of small birds are questionable. The Hammer-headed Fruit Bat drinks by scooping water directly into his mouth while flying close to water or indirectly by wetting fur while skimming over water and licking water from fur.	W & C Africa from Guinea E to South Sudan , Ethiopia , Uganda , and W Kenya , S to DR Congo and NW Angola , also on Bioko I.		During the day, males and females generally roost in large trees. Early in the morning, they defecate at their roost site and then rest or sleep until sundown. During the day, they do not make noises, groom, or squabble, and males, which generally rest on the outside of the group, do not approach females. In the evening, individuals wake, start grooming themselves, and leave individually to start foraging or fly to lek sites. Roostsites are 20-30 m aboveground, where Hammer-headed Fruit Bats hang on exposed branches beneath dense foliage. Other roost types exceptionally include undergrowth, rocks, and huts, and there is an unconfirmed record of a cave. Males compete in leks by beating their wings and especially by making loud honking sounds (c.2-3/second). These calls attract females.

Buttikofer’s Epauletted Fruit Bat seems to prefer moist savannas, although it penetrates into lowland rainforests, disturbed forests, secondary bush, cultivated land, gallery forests, and edges of closed forest.	Buittikofer’s Epauletted Fruit Bat is primarily frugivorous and lands on fruit and then carries it in the mouth to feeding sites 50-100 m away. Feet and thumbs are used to put food in expansible cheek pouches, where juices and small seeds are extracted. Feeding roosts are used for more than ten days. Large fruits (more than 20 g ) mainly from Ficus capensis and FE vallis-choudae (both Moraceae ) dominated diets in Guinean Savanna areas. In other areas, diets can be very diverse with fruits from up to 15 plant genera in 13 families, including Solanum torvum and S. erianthum ( Solanaceae ), Milicia excelsa ( Moraceae ), Momordica sp.

Female Buttikofer’s Epauletted Fruit Bats leave their roosts at dusk and forage throughout the night. Males establish calling stations and call for several hours a night until about midnight when they begin to forage. For mating, males form an “exploded” lek along riverbanks, and they emit loud rhythmic calls (*kyonks”) at a rate of one per second; rate increases when females approach. Females actively select calling males and copulate. Activity in leks changes with the season; during mating periods (February—April and August-December), calling starts at ¢.19:45 h.

In South Africa , distribution of Wahlberg's Epauletted Fruit Bat is strongly associated with annual precipitation.	Wahlberg's Epauletted Fruit Bats eat soft fruits, pollen, and nectar, for which they can commute more than 13 km each night. Primary food sources are figs ( Ficus , Moraceae ); other food comes from at least 24 plant genera in 14 families. Cultivated fruits (sometimes from ornamental gardens) that are eaten are generally too ripe for commercial use. Wahlberg's Epauletted Fruit Bats feed while briefly hovering in front of fruits or flowers or after landing on a branch nearby. Fruitis often carried to a feeding perch where it is slowly chewed. Large pieces of fruit are held in one foot against the chest. Wahlberg's Epauletted Fruit Bats pollinate Adansonia ( Malvaceae ) and probably Parinari ( Chrysobalanaceae ). Juices from leaves of Balanites ( Zygophyllaceae ) are swallowed, possibly for steroidal sapogenins and proteins. Beetles and other insects found in stomach contents might be eaten for protein, but accidental swallowing cannot be excluded. They do not seem to drink but were observed flying low over water and wetting ventral pelage.

Wahlberg's Epauletted Fruit Bats hang from one or both feet and remain motionless for long periods. Following a grooming session of ¢.30 minutes, they generally leave their roosts at dusk one by one, often in different directions. They fly during the entire night, but flight intensity drops to one-half peak level after 20:00 h. At dawn, they return to their roosts where theystart nose-to-nose sniffing and sometimes licking, probably enabling mutual recognition.

During the first hoursafter nightly activity ends, they slept with both eyes closed, but this changed to one eye open later on, reaching a peak at ¢.10:00 h. Courting males generally use perches near roosts, 2-20 m aboveground, and at least 50 m from competing males, where they make moderately loud gong-like calls with fundamental frequency at 7-9 kHz and several harmonics, with durations of 200- 300 milliseconds, repeated about once a second. Call frequency of males increases in presence of females; males show off their epaulettes, quiver, and beat their half-opened wings once or twice with each call.

These plants are usually accessed from tunnels belowground, but occasionally individuals emerge to clip plants aboveground and carry them to burrows. Seeds and insects also have been recorded. Stored food in caches can be 25 kg.			Middle East Blind Mole-rats are active year-round and ¢.50% of the day. During the rainy season, they appear to be diurnal and polyphasic. During dry season, they are nocturnal and monophasic. The Middle East Blind Mole-rat is a chiseltooth digger. Although it can dislodge some material with head or forelimbs, almost all digging occurs with its lower incisors. Accumulated dirt is pushed to surface with head or back legs and ejected in mounds. More digging occurs in the rainy season when soil is easier to move. The Middle East Blind Mole-rat lives most ofits life underground, but it emerges and is active aboveground with some frequency in March-May and autumn. Aboveground activities include searching and foraging for food and dispersing.	Coskun et al. (2012), Ellerman & Morrison-Scott (1951), Hadid, Németh et al. (2012), Hadid, Tzur et al.

The Giant Root Rat prefers soil depths greater than 50 cm in swamp shore grasslands and mixed herbaceous moorlands. Moist soils are preferred. In the Bale Mountains of Ethiopia, the African Root Rat (7. splendens ) is replaced by the Giant Root Rat at elevations above 3000 m.	The Giant Root Rat feeds on grasses and forbs such as Festuca ( Poaceae ) and Alchemilla ( Rosaceae ). Food is gathered by opening a hole to the surface and consuming plant material within easy reach of the opening. An individual usually keeps its hindquarters in the opening to facilitate quick escape into the burrow. When food in an area is depleted, the Giant Root Ratseals the opening and creates a new burrow elsewhere. A mouthful of food is collected in short foraging bouts of 6-8 minutes and is taken belowground for consumption.			The Giant Root Rat is diurnal and active from 08:00 h to 16:00 h. Aboveground activity comes in short bursts, roughly ten bouts in dry season adding up to an hour of activity, with fewer during rainy season.

The Plateau Zokor prefers moist soil and degraded grassland and avoids desert, irrigated land, and boulder fields. Microclimate of its burrows allows for less extreme temperature swings and milder temperatures overall. While aboveground January temperatures may be —4 to —=38°C, burrows maintain a temperature of 0-5°C. Humidity is high (79-87-3%) in these burrows compared to dry external climate (31-7-53-3%). Nevertheless, microclimate in burrows presents challenges. Oxygen levels are low (17-18:4% in burrow compared to 20-4% externally), and carbon dioxide levels are extremely high (0-22-1-5% in burrow compared to 0-03% outside). The Plateau Zokoris a subterranean and a high-elevation species, and it has substantially elevated red blood cell counts and hemoglobin concentration; it is extremely efficient at delivering oxygen to tissue. Oxygen pressure in arterial blood of the Plateau Zokoris 1-5 times higher than laboratory rats, and oxygen pressure in venous blood is 0-26 times that of lab rats.	Plateau Zokors feed on roots and shoots of forbs, grasses, and some shrubs. They prefer taproots and storage organs of plants such as Notopterygium forbesii ( Apiaceae ), Potentilla anserina ( Rosaceae ), Morina chinensis ( Caprifoliaceae ), and dandelions ( Taraxacum , Asteraceae ). Plants are accessed from feeding tunnels belowground. The Plateau Zokor will grab roots and pull the entire plant down into the tunnel system where it is consumed. All zokors have an adaptation in the thumb claw where it is shortened and wears away leaving a central gap. Under laboratory conditions, the Plateau Zokor uses this thumb claw to clean off taproots such as dandelions. The root is then held in both hands, resting in these thumb gaps,as it is consumed.			Plateau Zokors live mostly belowground. They are active year-round but have higher activity levels in spring and autumn and lowest in winter. The Plateau Zokorsleeps very deeply and can be handled or subjected to loud noises without waking up.	Allen (1940), Ellerman & Morrison-Scott (1951), Fan Naichang & Shi Yinzhu (1982), He Ya et al.

The Hoary Bamboo Ratis not common in agricultural areas or mature forest. In the northern parts of its distribution, it is found in bamboo thickets or beardgrass ( Polypogon , Poaceae ) at elevations of less than 1000 m in China and less than 1500 m in north-eastern India, especially where it overlaps with the Chinese Bamboo Rat, which lives at higher elevations. In the southern part ofits distribution, the Hoary Bamboo Rat is found at a broader range of elevations of 100-4000 m. In China, individuals appear to move among habitats seasonally, preferring large bamboo groves, secondary forest, and shrub forest in spring and summer and sparsely forested regions with silvergrass ( Miscanthus sinensis , Poaceae ) or forked ferns ( Dicranopteris , Gleicheniaceae ) in autumn and winter.	Hoary Bamboo Rats feed on roots and shoots of bamboo, beardgrass,silvergrass, and occasionally other plant types. Individuals generally feed on plants within 5-10 m from their burrow entrance. Food may be eaten outside the burrow or dragged back into the burrow. Stalks are held in place by front paws, while outer layers are stripped by incisors. Food is consumed in a manner where upper incisors are held motionless, lower incisors plane the object, and food is chewed by molars. Small uneaten nubs remain after feeding. Captive individuals manually remove cylindrical fecal pellets using incisors and toss them into dung piles. Presumably similar behavior occurs in the wild either in a toilet chamber, or fecal pellets are brought to the toilet.			The Hoary Bamboo Rat exits its burrow at night to feed on the surface.

Many of the subspecies live in flat semi-deserts with extremely hot days and cool nights.	When grass is abundant, Asiatic Wild Asses are primarily grazers. During the dry season, or in the driest habitats, they will switch to browse, even consuming woody parts of plants. They also eat seedpods and will use their hooves to break apart woody material to reach succulent forbs. In Mongolia, asses often eat snow in the winter as a substitute for drinking water and have been known to dig holes 60 cm deep to reach water in the summer.			Asiatic Wild Asses are most active at dawn and dusk, when temperatures are cooler. Although they obtain most of their water from food, they are almost always seen within 30 km of water.

The last wild horse was seen in the very arid Dzungarian Gobi Desert in Mongolia , and there has been much debate about whether it was in its preferred habitat or justits last refuge. One view holds that of the three wild horse species that once inhabited the grasslands of Europe, Central Asia, and China , Przewalski’s Horse was the one that thrived at the easternmost edge of the range, where it encountered limited water and arid conditions as part of its natural habitat. Another view holds that these horses favored the more mesic grassland steppes of Mongolia , but as a result of more than a thousand years of competitive exclusion by nomadic pastoralists, they were forced into the deserts, where they fared poorly and died out. Domestic Horses do not fare well in dry climes, but ecological studies on feral horses show that some populations can survive in arid environments where food is scare and the best patches are often far from water. However, other studies show that populations survive and reproduce better in more mesic areas where vegetation is more abundant, more evenly distributed, and water is close to feeding areas. Grass and water are more plentiful in the mesic grasslands of Mongolia , but the winters there are harsher than in the Dzungarian Gobi. Today, populations of Przewalski’s Horses have been reintroduced into the mesic grasslands of central Mongolia as well as arid areas on the edge of the Gobi Desert and the Kalamaili Nature Reserve, which lies adjacent to the painted desert of China . Populations continue to survive in both xeric and mesic areas, although the population in China requires more active management than the ones in Mongolia .	Like feral horses, Przewalski’s Horses are grazers. They inhabit steppe vegetation, especially the grasslands and shrublands of Central Asia. In summer they consume high-quality forage near water. In the winter, however, they must subsist on more fibrous food that can be difficult to locate because of snow cover. Fortunately, strong winds often blow the snow away, making succulent vegetation available.			Przewalski’s Horses are active day and night, but generally sleep for four hours per day, mostly at night. In Mongolia, during the summer they are most active and move to streams and brooks to forage and drink. During the hottest times of the day they move up to ridge tops where cool breezes reduce attacks by biting flies. Przewalski’s Horses of the Khustain Nuruu National Park in Mongolia coexist with Gray Wolves (Canis lupus). Foals are at the highest risk, and when wolves are detected, females, both mothers and non-mothers, form a defensive circle around the foals. As long as three or more females are present, foal chances of survival are high.	Ballou (1994), Berger (1986), Bokonyi (1974), Boyd & Houpt (1994), Boyd et al. (2008), Dierendonck et al.

Sandy habitats are avoided. Recorded up to 1500 m of elevation in Ethiopia .	The African Wild Ass mostly grazes, eating grasses, especially Eragrostis, Dactyloctenium, and Chrysopogon when available, and tougher Panicum and Lasiurus species, as well as herbs and general browse. The asses use their incisors and hooves to break apart the tougher foods. Although they can sustain water losses of up to 30% of their body weight, they can replenish these losses within two to five minutes. Nevertheless, they need to drink water at least once every three days and most individuals are observed within 30 km of a water source.			The species is most active in the early morning, late afternoon, or at night, when the desert is cooler. During the hottest part of the day it seeks shade in nearby rocky hills whereit rests. Its body temperature can range from 35°C to 41-5°C, depending on ambient temperature. Females maintain higher body temperatures than males by sweating less, thus retaining water longer.

It rangesas far south as the Himalayas and north to the Kunlun-Arjin Shan Mountains. Tibetan Wild Asses inhabit three major vegetation zones: alpine meadow, alpine steppe, and desert steppe. Alpine meadows are generally found at elevations below 4500 m in areas where precipitation exceeds 400 mm per year. Vegetation in these meadows starts growing earlier than in the other areas and short sedges, such as Kobresia, and forbs cover about 25-30% of the surface. Alpine steppe is the most abundant habitat on the Tibetan Plateau, occurring at elevations between 4000 m and 5000 m . Precipitation is low and vegetation is sparse, covering less than 15% of the ground, with Stipa, Festuca, and Poa being the most common grasses. Desert steppe occurs at elevations greater than 5000 m . Although the vegetation of the desert steppe is similar to that of the alpine steppe, only 5% of the ground is covered in vegetation. Not surprisingly, the Tibetan Wild Ass occupies mostly alpine meadows and steppe. Almost 80% of Tibetan Wild Ass sightings are in the basins in these habitats. Most of the other sightings are on the hills. Open plains seem to be used as refuges from predators.	Tibetan Wild Asses are grazers, mostly concentrating on Stipa, which comprises up to 656% ofits diet in summer and up to 95% in winter. Small amounts of forbs and shrubs are also consumed, and in winter, digging for roots is also common. Waterholes are scarce in the summer and often frozen in the winter, when snow is eaten instead. When the vegetation is of high quality, Tibetan Wild Asses acquire most of their water from vegetation.			Tibetan Wild Asses move seasonally among habitats. They disperse in small groups into the hills during the summer in search of high-quality food. As harsh winter conditions set in, they return to basins and flatlands at lower elevations, often forming large concentrations. In the summer, they move daily from lower areas where they spend the night to higher elevations as daytime temperatures rise.	Feng Zuojian (1991a, 1991b), Fox et al.

Since Plains Zebras need to drink daily, they are restricted to habitats where water can be accessed within half a day’s walk. Only deserts, dense woodlands, and permanent wetlands are avoided.	Plains Zebra are true grazers. As hindgut fermenters, they require large quantities of food, so it is not surprising that they spend up to 20 hours per day foraging. Yet they are selective foragers, disproportionately consuming Perisetum and Themeda grasses when available. They can only forage in mesic areas where feeding sites and watering points are close together.			Plains Zebras are active day and night and organize their daily activities around drinking. Most individuals need to drink once per day, but in very dry conditions, some drink more often. During the dry season the need for water constrains Plains Zebra groups from wandering more than 5-10 km from reliable water. After the rains, they spread out and range widely, seeking superior grazing areas located near transient water sources.

It does not need to drink daily and lives in habitats intermediate between the arid habitats of the true desert-dwelling African Wild Ass (FE. africanus ), and the more water dependant Plains Zebra , which inhabits mesic tropical grasslands. Lactating females stay in the most open areas around water; non-lactating females and territorial males prefer grassy areas with light tree cover. Bachelor males grade into areas of medium or moderate bush, but overall, Grevy’s Zebras avoid densely wooded areas except during periods of extreme drought.	Grevy’s Zebras are predominantly grazers, but browse can account for up to 30% oftheir diet during drought or when foraging on landscapes degraded by livestock. They move through habitats quickly, taking many steps per bite, selectively choosing certain grass species over others. As a result, when grazing herds of Grevy’s and Plains Zebras form, the herds don’t persist for long, since Grevy’s Zebras simply pass through them. Availability of water and individual water requirements ultimately determine where Grevy’s Zebras can forage. Since non-lactating females can go without water for up to five days, they typically range far from water, seeking out previously well-watered areas with large quantities of vegetation. Lactating females, with their need to produce milk, must drink daily. Thus they remain near water, feeding on closely cropped grazing lawns that offer forage of high nutritive quality even if the amount of available food is limited.			Grevy’s Zebras are opportunists and move great distances in search of food and water. Females and their young, as well as bachelor males, have large home ranges, often moving with the rains to areas where grass is growing or abundant. Territorial males tend to linger on their territories until well after all other zebras have left and only depart when conditions have deteriorated dramatically. During normal dry seasons, when all Grevy’s Zebras are dependent on water, concentrations of males and females develop. Given that Grevy’s Zebras often move 35 km per day if food and water are widely separated, aggregations tend to split apart and are never very large. Sightings of a few hundred Grevy’s Zebras at a time are rare. Although the availability of food and water determine most movements, predation plays a role. Grevy’s Zebras avoid human settlements during the day because of stresses associated with human activity, but at night settlements are sought as refuges against predators.	Cordingley et al.

Cape Mountain Zebras are found up to 2000 m in the summer. Hartmann’s Mountain Zebras sometimes are found on salt flats. In the recent past they were commonly found in the bushy karoo upland shrub where summer droughts were compensated for by night-time dew and mist.	Mountain Zebras eat mostly grass, although browse in the form of leaves and bark is occasionally consumed. Mountain Zebras generally drink twice per day.			Mountain Zebras are most active in the morning and in the late afternoon until sunset. They remain inactive during the middle of the day and seek shelter from the heat when possible. Individuals feed for more than half the daylight hours. Hartmann’s Mountain Zebras have a grazing area of 6-20 km* during winter and considerably smaller areas in the summer. Their home ranges are thought to be around 3-16 km?*.	Kingdon (1997), Lloyd (1984), Millar (1970a, 1970b), Novellie (2008), Novellie et al (2002), Penzhorn (1975).

They may also occur in deep waters in some inshore regions, such as in south-eastern Alaska, but only where there are shallow waters nearby. Habitat of the Harbor Porpoise is cool temperate to subpolar waters, generally with low water temperatures.	Harbor Porpoises are opportunistic feeders, although their main prey appears to vary on regional and seasonal scales. In the North Atlantic, they feed primarily on clupeoids and gadoids, while in the North Pacific, they prey largely on engraulids and scorpaenids. They eat a wide variety offish and cephalopods, although the diet in any specific area may be dominated by just a few species. Harbor Porpoises feed heavily on small schooling fish that occur in the water column, such as herring and sprat ( Clupeidae ), capelin (Mallotus), hake (Merluccius), and mackerel ( Scomber , Scombridae ); they also consume market squid ( Loligo ) in some areas. Although many of these prey species occur in the water column, many of the other prey species are benthic or demersal. Benthic invertebrates are sometimes also consumed, but these are generally considered to be secondarily ingested. In the north-eastern Atlantic, there has apparently been a long-term shift from predation on declining stocks of clupeid fish (mainly herring, Clupea harengus ) to sand lance ( Ammodytidae ) and gadoid fish.			Harbor Porpoises are shy and unobtrusive animals, with a low surfacing profile and not a great deal of aerial behavior. They do not ride bow waves of vessels, and in many cases, they appear to actively avoid motorized vessels. There are exceptions to this, and at least in the San Francisco Bay area, they may be more approachable. These individuals sometimes lie nearly motionless at the surface for several seconds, and it is not clear why they do this. The typical surfacing pattern is a slow roll, in which the individual does not create any splash. At times, they do move faster and surface with a sloppy splash (this is called “pop-splashing,” and the splash looks very different from the more V-shaped splash of a rooster-tailing Dall’s Porpoise). Diving behavior of Harbor Porpoises has been studied with time-depth recording tags. Although most dives last less than one minute, Harbor Porpoises have been found to be capable of diving to depths of at least 220 m and for periods of more than five minutes.

The current range of the Vaquita is characterized by moderately shallow waters (mostly less than 40 m deep) just south of the mouth of the Colorado River. These waters are murky and sedimentladen. They are biologically very productive, with high chlorophyll levels, and can reach very high temperatures in summer and autumn.	The Vaquita appears to be an opportunistic feeder, eating a variety of small benthic and demersal fish species. Some cephalopods and crustaceans are also eaten. Although only a handful of stomachs have been examined to determine feeding habits, the Vaquita appears to feed mostly on several species of grunts and croakers ( Sciaenidae ). They also occasionally feed on squid (e.g. Lolliguncula ).	N Gulf of California (also called the Sea of Cortez) in N Mexico, the smallest known distribution of any marine cetacean.	https://zenodo.org/record/6607339/files/figure.png	There have been no detailed studies of the behavior of the Vaquita, and all that has been learned comes from opportunistic sightings or those that occurred during other types of studies. Vaquitas are generally considered to be elusive and difficult to approach. They have a low, cryptic surfacing pattern that generally does not produce any splash or visible blow. They tend to stay many hundreds of meters away from large, motorized vessels, but they may occasionally approach smaller, idling vessels. When foraging, they generally surface 3-5 times and then perform a longer dive that may last several minutes. Their surfacing behavior is very unpredictable. They do not ride bow waves of boats and have never been observed breaching or performing other aerial displays.	Barlow et al. (2010), D'/Agrosa et al.

Dall’s Porpoises are generally found far offshore, but they do occur in nearshore waters where there is water deeper than 100-200 m nearby. They are commonly seen in the inshore waters of north-western USA (Washington, Alaska) and west Canada (British Columbia), where they inhabit deep channels and passes.	Dall’s Porpoises are opportunistic feeders, taking a wide variety of prey items. These include mostly mid-water and surface-living fish and cephalopods, such as herring ( Clupea ), anchovies ( Engraulis ), sardines ( Sardinops , Clupeidae ), hake (Merluccius), sauries ( Cololabis , Scomberesocidae ), lanternfish ( Myctophidae ), and gonatid squid ( Gonatidae ). They occasionally consume invertebrates such as krill, decapods, and various species of shrimps, but these latter items are not considered to be their primary prey.			Dall’s Porpoise is an active, energetic species. It may be the fastest swimmer of the cetaceans, at least for short bursts. They are most frequently seen swimming very quickly and throwing up a large V-shaped rooster-tail of spray as they surface to breathe at high speed, bringing only very little of their body above the surface. When riding bow waves of vessels, which they do frequently, they rooster-tail on virtually every surfacing, but at other times, they slow down and surface in a slow roll, with no splash. Breaching, spy hopping, and other types of aerial displays are not common, and they very rarely porpoise completely clear of the water.

Both marine and fresh waters are inhabited, and there is a population of Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises found exclusively in the freshwaters of China’s largestriver, the Yangtze. Althoughit tends to occur mostly very near shore, it has a greater tendency than the Indo-Pacific Finless Porpoise to be found in offshore waters. Shallow, offshore (more than 240 km from shore, but less than 200 m deep) regions of the Yellow and Bohai seas are inhabited by the Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoise.	Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises feed on a wide variety of small marine organisms, some of which are pelagic; others are benthic or demersal. Its prey includes fish (families such as Apogonidae , Carangiade , Clupeidae , Sparidae , Engraulidae , Sciaenidae , Gobiidae , and Atherinidae ), cephalopods ( Octopodidae , Sepiidae , Sepiolidae , and Loliginidae ), and crustaceans (mostly shrimps). Available data also indicate that Narrow-ridged Finless Porpoises in the Yangtze River feed on fish and shrimps.			Both species of finless porpoises are very cryptic, and they generally have a low surfacing profile. Although they do not appear to leap from the water very frequently, individuals have been observed performing “tail stands” in the Yangtze River. They can be very active at times and will often chase fish at very high speeds, making sharp turns and fast accelerations. There are reports of mother porpoises carrying young on their backs (supposedly with the offspring lying on the roughened dorsal ridge), but these reports are somewhat questionable. They do not ride bow waves of vessels, and they may move away with rooster-tail-type splashes when they are startled by a motor boat.	Akamatsu et al. (2010), Amano (2009), Amano et al.

Spectacled Porpoises appear to prefer cold waters, with temperatures of 1-10°C, but in fact,little is known of the ecology ofthis elusive species. The southernmost sighting of Spectacled Porpoisesis currently 64° 34” S.	Only a very small handful of stomachs from Spectacled Porpoises have been examined, so very little is understood about their feeding habits or preferences. From what is known, they appear to be opportunistic, feeding on prey items ranging from anchovies ( Engraulis ) and other small schooling fish to stomatopods and even algae (although the latter items may have been ingested incidentally just before stranding).	Although previously thought to be exclusively coastal, like other members of the genus, recent sightings in oceanic waters of the Antarctic and subantarctic zones suggest that the species actually has a circumpolar distribution and may be largely oceanic.	https://zenodo.org/record/6607335/files/figure.png	Numbers of live sightings of Spectacled Porpoises at sea are very limited, and all of these have been opportunistic, so not much is known about their activity patterns. They have inconspicuous surfacing patterns and generally do not ride bow waves or leap clear of the water, although they have been enticed to occasionally surface quickly alongside the bow of research vessels.

Burmeister’s Porpoises occur in some open-ocean waters but also in enclosed bays, channels, and fjords, and they have even been seen upstream in some rivers. They inhabit cooler waters, and water temperature may limit their northern distribution.	Burmeister’s Porpoises feed on a variety of pelagic and demersal fish and invertebrate species, including anchovies ( Engraulis and Anchoa ), hake (Merluccius), sardines ( Sardinops or Sciaena ), silversides (Odontesthes), sculpin (Normanichthys), squid (such as Loligo ), and shrimps. In the central coast of Peru, fish generally make up the majority of the prey items (98%).

Records from Uruguay and Brazil may be associated with N extrusions ofcold water.	https://zenodo.org/record/6607337/files/figure.png	Very little is known about behavior and activities of Burmeister’s Porpoises, which have not been the subject of many ecological studies. Like other porpoises, they appear to be shy and inconspicuous, often avoiding vessels. They do not bow ride, and aerial behavior appears to be rather rare.	Beilis et al.

Noack’s Leaf-nosed Bat does not occur in drier savannas except along rivers. Locally, it occurs at higher elevations—e.g. up to 1000 m on Mount Nimba . It may utilize agricultural land but typically under semi-natural habitats where some indigenous trees and well-developed undergrowth vegetation persists.	Noack’s Leaf-nosed Bat is insectivorous, feeding predominandy on beedes but it may also take a variety of other arthropods. It typically forages in cluttered vegetation, departing from the day roost at sunset and returning with bulging stomach two hours later. It may forage within agricultural land, particularly where these are intermixed with natural vegetation.	Widely in tropical Africa, but boundaries of each lineage (presumably separate species) are not known; this species complex occurs almost continuously from Senegal , Gambia , and Guinea E to S Sudan and Ethiopia , and S to Gabon , Republic of the Congo , DR Congo , and Tanzania , with isolated populations in NW Angola , Zambia , Malawi , and N Mozambique ; also on Principe and Sâo Tomé Is.	https://zenodo.org/record/3749155/files/figure.png	Noack’s Leaf-nosed Bat roosts during the day in a variety of cavities and structures including caves, hollow trees, holes in the ground, old mines, culverts under roads, and abandoned houses. Like its congeners, it has a low wing loading and low aspect ratio, allowing it to fly in cluttered environments such as thickets, and to take off from the ground. It is active throughout the year. Bats emerge from day roost at sunset and are active throughout the night, but with three peaks of activity corresponding to the first two hours after sunset, an hour around midnight and the hour before sunrise. Males tend to fly for a longer period per night than females. Echolocation call includes a F component that is highly variable and may be distincdy different in different lineages—e.g. at Mount Nimba , in Liberia , one lineage had an echolocation call at 128 kHz, whereas the second lineage called at 148 kHz. Published accounts of echolocation calls of the H. ruber complex typically fall within this range of variation.

Semon’s Leaf-nosed Bat usually feeds on insects, especially moths; it also takes beetles, as well as spiders. It hunts prey from the ground, low vegetation or surfaces such as rocks or tree trunks. It has a slow flight, with considerable ability to maneuver, and usually flies within 1—2 m of the ground, foraging within dense vegetation and scrub.	E New Guinea and NE Australia , where it has been reported in several locations of coastal Queensland from the E side of Cape York Peninsula to S of Cooktown; S limit of its distribution is not clear, as there are acoustic reports from other distant areas, such as in the Kroombit Tops National Park.	https://zenodo.org/record/3749057/files/figure.png	Semon’s Leaf-nosed Bat has been observed roosting in many different places such as in caves, mines, abandoned buildings, road culverts, fissures, and tree hollows. Some authors have suggested that this species is more tree-dweller than cave-dweller, inhabiting caves probably during the drier periods. Males and females have been suggested to have different echolocation call frequencies, being c.75 kHz and 95 kHz, respectively.

The Diadem Leaf-nosed Bat forages in forest understory, in gaps, and over streams in forest. It feeds on insects (Coleoptera, Lepidoptera , and various orthopteroids were the most common in fecal pellets) and occasionally on birds. It is known to feed by hanging from a perch and waiting for prey to pass by, then flying to snatch it and returning right away to the perch.			This species roosts in caves, crevices, and hollow trees. In peninsular Thailand , the Diadem Leaf-nosed Bat was observed to remain in the cave late, until 20:00 h, being the last species that emerged from the roost Echolocation is a CF/FM type, with a call frequency of the F segment of 58-62 kHz (Malay Peninsula) and 64—66 kHz (Borneo).

Beecroft’s Anomalures are also commonly found in disturbed forest such as cultivated groves of African oil palm ( Elaeis guineensis, Arecaceae ). They occur from sea level to elevations of 2500 m.	Beecroft’s Anomalures eat leaves, bark, and fruit from a variety of trees and occasionally insects. They feed on pulp offruit of the African oil palm, which they manage to access despite the protection of short spines.

They may also rest in junctions between palm fronds, or cling to sheltered undersides of major tree branches close to the trunk, where their mottled coat helps to camouflage them away from predators. A jaw fragment of Beecroft’s Anomalures was found in a Chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) fecal sample in the Tenkere area in Sierra Leone. Other likely predators include crowned eagles (Stephanoaetus coronatus), long-tailed hawks (Urotriorchis macrourus), and pythons ( Pythonidae ).	Allen, G.M. & Coolidge (1930), Allen, J.A.

In the south-eastern part of its wide distribution, Lord Derby’s Anomalure is known to occur in savanna woodland. Although they can be common in undisturbed forest, they may also nest within dead trees in areas that have been cleared and burned for agriculture, as long as trees are within gliding distance to nearby forest.	Bark of trunk and main branches of several genera of trees appear to be the dietary staple of Lord Derby’s Anomalure. Feeding individuals appear to focus on bark wounds caused by falling branches, elephanttusks, and growth splits. As a consequence of this feeding behavior, some trees such as beli ( Julbernardia pellegriniana, Fabaceae ) may lose all their bark on their trunks and main branches over a number of years. Loss of bark appears to be tolerated by the tree because they are able rapidly to regrow their cambium layer, suggesting that these rodents and trees have coevolved. Lord Derby’s Anomalures eat fruits of Carapa ( Meliaceae ) and Syzygium ( Myrtaceae ), leaves of Cynometra ( Fabaceae ) and Myrianthus ( Moraceae ), and bark of various trees, including those of the genera Neoboutonia ( Euphorbiaceae ) Cynometra , Pentaclethra ( Fabaceae ), Klainedoxa ( Irvingiaceae ), Carapa , Syzygium , and Strombosia ( Olacaceae ) and Strombosia ( Olacaceae ). Elsewhere, they eat fruits, flowers, leaves, nuts, and occasional insects such as ants and termites.	Not yet recorded in Benin where may occur and possibly on Zanzibar I.	https://zenodo.org/record/6584338/files/figure.png	Lord Derby’s Anomalure is nocturnal, with individuals resting in hollow trees during the day, preferably in virgin forest. These hollows can be up to 40 m above the ground (in some woodlands they occupy empty beehives). One radiocollared individual in Gabon had one primary nesting tree hollow and five secondary hollows. They tend to nest alone or in pairs of one female and a young. Other observations suggest that up to eight individuals may share a denning tree, but little is known about their social behavior. Lord Derby’s Anomalures also appear to be sedentary, living in the same hole all year, except when fruit is ripe in another area. Individuals retain use of their dens over very long periods, but seasonal shifts have been recorded. Along with a threatening or defensive hiss and growl, Lord Derby’s Anomalures also purr and twitter. They like to sunbathe in early morning and more rarely in the evening. Pruning in closed-canopy forest is often less frequent or conspicuous than in more open or sunlit areas. Where light breaks through close to a food tree, intense pruning of young trees may help maintain access to a ready food supply by killing or maiming competing trees and keeping flight-paths open. Night is spent moving in lower branches oftall trees and smaller growth, often not more than 9 m above the ground. While resting, a Lord Derby’s Anomalure orientatesitself with head upward and body parallel with the bole of the tree.

Group sizes of Azara’s Night Monkey are smaller in the more xeric regions of the Chaco compared with humid (mesic) regions. Seasonality in these environments is strong, and temperatures range between —=5°C and 47°C. The Feline Night Monkey has been recorded in Orbignya ( Arecaceae ) palm forest (the Zona dos Cocais in Maranhao ), forest patches and gallery forests in the “cerrado” (bush savanna) of central Brazil , and the “caatinga” (deciduous scrub and forest) in north-eastern Brazil . It also occurs in mangrove forest.	Diet of Azara’s Night Monkey is composed of fruits, nectar, flowers, leaves, fungi, and insects. Feeding ecology of the nominate subspecies has been studied in the subtropical dry forest of Paraguay . Azara’s Night Monkeys there were more folivorous than the Black-headed Night Monkey (A. nigriceps ) in Peru , concentrating on leaves of small trees and vines for 46% of their feeding time and with fruit being only 16% of the diet (as opposed to 60%), and nectar and flowers 33%. At times of fruit shortage, Black-headed Night Monkeys eat more flowers, nectar, fig fruits, and insects, rather than leaves. Flowers can also be seasonally important, for example those of Tabebuia ipe ( Bignoniaceae ). Azara’s Night Monkeys have been seen to catch cicadas during the day.			In Paraguay , the nominate subspecies is partially diurnal, foraging during the day for periods of one to three hours. Large raptors such as the harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja) and the Guiana crested eagle (Morphnus guianensis) are rare there, and the principal, potential, avian predator is the great horned owl (Bubo virgintanus). When traveling at night, they are quieter than is typical for night monkeys of the Amazonian forest possibly because of this. Temperature may be another factor promoting diurnal activity. Low temperatures do not completely inhibit their traveling and foraging, but when night-time temperatures are 5°-10°C, they forage in the late afternoon at temperatures of 25°-30°C. Diurnal foraging and traveling increases when the weather is cooler. A field study of the subspecies Bolivian Night Monkey in Beni , Bolivia , recorded an activity budget of 31% foraging, 49% resting, and 20% traveling. Groups travel longer during full-moon nights than new-moon nights, and ambient temperature also influences distances moved during full-moon nights.

Black-headed Night Monkeys eatfruits, which account for ¢.60% of their diet, but they also eat nectar, young leaves and buds,insects, and spiders. In Cocha Cashu Biological Station in Manu National Park and Biosphere Reserve, Peru , they tend to feed more in large trees with larger crowns (more than 11 m in diameter) than sympatric diurnal titi monkeys (similar in size and also living in small monogamous groups) that customarily follow a regular foraging circuit to find small quantities of fruits in smaller crowned trees. Associated with their use of larger-crowned trees, Blackheaded Night Monkeys travel and forage higher up in the forest canopy than the titi monkeys, which spend more than 50% their time in the lower canopy and understory, perhaps due to the titi monkeys susceptibility to predation by diurnal raptors. Diets of Black-headed Night Monkeys and titi monkeys include many bitter or spicy (e.g. Lauraceae ) and unripe fruits not generally eaten by other monkeys. Black-headed Night Monkeys forage for insects, especially at dawn and dusk, searching along branches and among foliage. They are adept at catching insects in mid-air and eat moths, beetles, and particularly orthopterans (katydids and grasshoppers of 6-10 cm in length, which call and are active at night and more easily located). Black-headed Night Monkeys are more insectivorous than titi monkeys that supplement the fruit part of their diet more with leaves. When fruits are scarce at the end of the wet season and in the early dry season, Black-headed Night Monkeys eat mostly figs, nectar, and insects. Their consumption of figs is facilitated by the lack of competition from the diurnal primates .			Black-headed Night Monkeys spend ¢.50% of the night active, with maximallevels of activity when the full moon is near the meridian. An activity budget generally consists of 53% foraging, 21% traveling, 22% resting, and 4% agonistic. They are very regular in their activity periods, consistently beginning their day about 13 minutes after sunset and reentering their sleeping sites about 15 minutes before sunrise.

Densities of Ma’s Night Monkeys are lower in terra firma forest because of a relative paucity of tree holes, their preferred sleeping sites, compared with lowland swamp and seasonally inundated forests. Trees in terra firma forest are predominantly hardwoods that provide fewer hollows for sleeping. Lowland swamp and inundated forests have a predominance of softwood that more easily form hollows and abundant dense vine tangles that these monkeys also use as sleeping sites.

The Brown-throated Three-toed Sloth can reach high densities in agricultural landscapes if overhead canopy trees are maintained. It is a generalist and uses manydifferent tree species, although individuals will specialize on a few species of trees and even spend a disproportionate amount of time resting and foraging within a few individual trees, or “modal” trees, in their home ranges. In an agricultural landscape in Costa Rica, Brown-throated Three-toed Sloths were strongly dependent on intact tropical forest and two species oftrees in the nettle family (Cecropra obtusifolia and Coussapoa villosa, Urticaceae ). In general, trees that have crowns exposed to sunlight and those that contain masses oflianas are selected.	The Brown-throated Three-toed Sloth is a strict folivore, consuming leaves in canopies oftrees. Individuals typically consume leaves in trees where they spend a considerable amount oftime. Diets vary spatially and overall include leaves from more than 50 plant species. They prefer and mostly consume young leaves, presumably because of their nutritional value. The Brown-throated Three-toed Sloth has one of the slowest rates ofdigestion. Nevertheless, estimated leaf removal rate is 5-1 g ofleaves/kg/day. Sloths, in general, are foregut-fermenting mammals, and the Brownthroated Three-toed Sloth possess a unique gut community dominated bythe bacterial phyla Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. Three-toed sloths possess a highly conserved, low-diversity foregut community, with highly abundant species of Neisseria bacteria.

Adults usually sleep for 15-18 hours/day, either holding on to a tree with their claws or resting in the crotch of a tree with their heads tucked into their chests. Three-toed sloths have a high degree of heterothermy in their body temperature, and therefore, they behaviorally adjust to ambient temperatures throughout the day. Individuals can be observed in the mornings ascending to the top of the canopy, presumably to warm in full sunlight, and descending into shade as daytime temperatures increase. During rainstorms, Brown-throated Threetoed Sloths do not seek shelter but typically rest in place.	Dill-McFarland et al. (2016), Garcés-Restrepo et al. (2017), Hayssen (2010), Mendoza etal.

In Meghalaya of India , in tropical forests at much lower elevations, between 700-1400 m . Typically in forests with bamboo-thicket understory. High bamboo cover, bamboo height, and canopy cover are important; preferred habitats have a high density ofshrubs, fallen logs, and tree stumps, yielding easy access to bambooleaves.	Diet largely vegetarian, 80-90% consisting of bamboo leaves, new shoots important in spring, fruits eaten in late summer and autumn. Usually feeds on the most nutritious bamboospecies in its habitat. Also eats roots, lichens, small vertebrates, birds eggs, insects and grubs.			Captive animals are nocturnal and crepuscular, and exhibit a polyphasic activity pattern throughout the night. In the wild, the Red Panda was thought to be most active at dawn, dusk, and at night, but several recent studies have consistently shown it is more active in the daytime than at night. In Wolong Nature Reserve, China , a subadult female, a female, and a male were reported to be active 36:5%, 49%, and 45% of the time, respectively. In Fengtongzhai Nature Reserve, bordering the former reserve on the north, six radio-collared Red Pandas had an average dailyactivity rate of 48-6%, with two peaks from 7:00 h to 10:00 h and from 17:00 h to 18:00 h. Generally, numerous periods ofrest are interspersed with frequent activity periods.	Bininda-Edmonds (2004), Choudhury (2001), Dawkins (1888), Endo et al. (1999), Flynn & Nedbal (1998), Flynn et al.

It has been suggested that 7. kanchil occurs primarily in hilly areas, but other sources stated that the species was absent from areas above 250 m in Sarawak , whereas 7. napu occurred much higher. This species also occurs in cultivated areas up to 600 m in elevation. The habitat of this species could be described as a mosaic ofriverine, seasonal swamp and dry undulating country, vegetated predominantly by legumes and dipterocarps, with stands of dense bamboo or palms for daytime resting. In Sabah , they also inhabit mangrove forest, and they can be quite common in monocultural tree plantations in a matrix of secondary forest stands. Even though the evidence is somewhat ambiguous,it appears that this species prefers disturbed forests to primary ones. A review of encounter rates in various parts of the species’ range suggested that the distribution of 7. kanchil is perhaps highly patchy and correlated to specific habitat features and microhabitats. What these features are remains unresolved, but their water requirements are important, as authors note commonness in riverine areas with surprising regularity. The habitat use of this species with respect to edge—interior areas shows startling heterogeneity, at least in non-Sundaic areas, but this cannot yet be explained; in particular, disentangling the contributions of intrinsic habitat suitability and the effects of hunting is difficult.	The speciesis largely frugivorous, but also feeds on shoots, young leaves, and fallen fruits. Fruit mass of consumed fruits varied from 1 g to 5 g and seed mass from 0-01 g to 0-5 g. On Borneo, the species feeds on a range offruiting species, including Polyanthia sumatrana, Diospyros macrophylla, Endospermum peltatum, Quercus sp., Garcinia forbesi and G. parviflora, Litsea caulocarpa and L. orocola, Notaphoebe sp., Dialum imdum, Aglaia sp., Chisocheton sp., Dysoxylum sp., Lansium sp., Artocarpus dadah, Ficus spp., Dimocarpus longan, Paranephelium xestophyllum, and Microros antidesmifolia.

The species also occurs in montane forests up to around 1850 m elevation. It has been observed that the species often occurs along forest streams and rivers. In the Eastern Ghats it was observed that M. indica was very common, especially around the streams and “nullahs” (intermitent watercourses) which are essential for this species.	Very little is known about the ecology and behavior of the Indian Chevrotain, and much of the information is in the form of anecdotal observations and sight records. It seems to mostly eat fruits and herbs, with fruit consumption of Terminalia bellerica, Gmelina arborea , and Garuga pinnata being reported; these are all common in the deciduous forests of India . In a study of fruit predation of the Indian gooseberry (Phyllanthus emblica) M. indica and the Chital (Axis axis) were the most frequent frugivores, accounting for over 95% of fruit removal, with murid rodents accounting for less than 1%. The Indian Chevrotain is a frequent prey of Leopards (Panthera pardus) and Dholes (Cuon alpinus) but apparently rarely eaten by Tigers (Panthera tigris) and Golden Jackals (Canis aureus). Among the small carnivores, the Nilgiri Marten (Martes gwatkinsii) is known to prey on the Indian Chevrotain, while the forest eagle owl (Bubo nipalensis) has been reported to predate on young ofthis species.

The species is, however, not a swamp specialist, and is often found in mature upland forest areas. Its range is thought to be limited by climatic factors: the species prefers habitats with very low seasonality and rainfall equal to or greater than 1500 mm /year, and it does not occur in areas that are even moderately seasonally arid. The species forages in clearings, floodplains, and along river banks at night, and retires to a hiding spot in dense cover during the day.	The Water Chevrotain is primarily a frugivore, and it has been suggested that year-round availability of fruits could be a key limiting habitat factor. Stomach content analysis of 19 animals in Gabon revealed that fruits comprise 68-7% of all foods eaten, which appears to be less than its Asian cousins. The rest of the diet includes leaves (9-9%), petioles and stems (20-5%), animal matter (0-14%), flowers (0-7%), and fungi (0-13%). Compared to duikers—small frugivores that share its habitat—the Water Chevrotain eats relatively little fruit and fungi, but many more succulent stems, and year-round fruit availability might not be as crucial a determinant for the species’ presence as suggested by a few ecological studies. At least 76 species of fruits have been identified in the species’ diet, with preferred species including Cylindropsis parvifolia ( Apocynaceae ), Bombax buonopozense ( Bombacaceae ), Alchornea cordifolia ( Euphorbiaceae ), Coelocaryon preussi and Pycnanthus angolensis ( Myristicaceae ), and Cissus dinklager ( Vitaceae ). In addition to these fruits, figs (Ficus spp.), Pseudospondias fruits, palm nuts (Elaeis), and breadfruit (Treculia) are consumed, as well as the fruits of gingers and arrowroots. Most fruits consumed are small to medium-sized, with a diameter between 0-5 cm and 2 cm . Water Chevrotains also feed on insects; they actively hunt for ants by licking the ground along ant trails. Apparently crabs, carrion, and scavenged fish also feature in the species’ diet. The Water Chevrotain consumes significantly less animal matter and fungus during the dry season,as well as 44% fewer fruit species. Young individuals that are still nursing eat smaller amounts offruit than adults (only 48:4% of the diet) and a larger proportion ofleaves (31:3%).			The species is thought to be exclusively nocturnal in the wild, being active almost always between dusk and dawn. In a captive population in Monrovia Zoo, Liberia , activity patterns showed that the species was active 4% of the day and 67% of the night.	Ansell (1974), Barnett & Prangley (1997), Barnett et al.

It may frequent mangroves and more open areas to forage. Dense vegetation within the forest interior provides shelter for this species during the daytime.	It is reported that 7. nigricans feeds mostly on leaves, which would set it aside from most other chevrotain species, which are primarily frugivorous. One photograph of a captive animal shows it feeding on grass-like leaves, which would confirm the above observation.	Balabac, Ramos, and Bugsuk Is, Palawan region , Phillipines. In the late 1990s, a small stock of eight Balabac Chevrotains escaped from their enclosures on Calauit Island, a small island off the coast of Busuanga Island, north of Palawan , where the species had been maintained and bred since 1982. These animals were reported to have increased to at least 21 free-living individuals by 2006. Apparently the species was also introduced to the larger island of Palawan . No recent records confirm that it is still extant there, although unconfirmed reports suggest that it may survive in southern Palawan .	https://zenodo.org/record/5721329/files/figure.png	Reported to be nocturnal.

It has been suggested that the foot morphology of 7. napu indicates a preference for more swampy habitats than 7. javanicus / 1. kanchil . Another source, from Borneo, however, claims that 7. napu is a hill species, found at no great elevation but never on swamps, plains and less often on river banks than 7. kanchil . T. napu seems to be scarcer in logged forest than in primary forest, with an 86% decline in density being reported following timber harvest. Daily home range use also appears to be more extensive in secondary forest. The sensitivity to logging is probably a consequence of diet constraints that limit the species’ ability to compensate for the reduced abundance of selected fruits in disturbed forest by utilizing browsing. In twelve-year-old logged forest, fewer trees remained belonging to genera eaten by 7. napu . On Tioman Island, of the coast of the Malay Peninsula, densities increased away from human settlements probably in direct relationship to hunting pressure; also 83% of observations on this island were in primary forests and 17% in secondary forests or rubber estates.	This species is mostly frugivorous, although few details on feeding are known. In captivity they eat most fruits and readily take to bananas, though their favorite food was mentioned to be the fruits and particularly the flowers of “Buah Simpoh” (presumably a Dillenia species). It has been asserted that 7. napu are prone to kill chickens, but no direct evidence for this was found.			7. napu is reported to be cathemeral (active day and night), but there are few data to support this.

The species has been reported in the drier semi-deciduous forests of eastern Java , butit seems to be rarer there than in the wetter forests of central and west Java . One habitat-use study suggested that 7. javanicus uses dense bushes and stands of Salacca zalacca palms during the day. It generally remains not far from rivers. This suggests that chevrotains there might be an “edge” species, apparently preferring areas with thick understory vegetation, such as that along riverbanks. This would not be unusual within the genus (see other Tragulus accounts). The species occurs from sea level to about 1600 m above sea level in the mountains.	In captivity Javan Chevrotains refuse grass as fodder and do not feed on any grasses that grow in their cages. Instead they are kept on banana peels, jackfruit, and the left-overs of rambutan and mangosteen fruits. In captivity, they are partial to leaves of a number of Acalypha ( Euphorbiaceae ) species, including A. marginata and A. wilkesiana, as well as leaves of Laeucaena glauca, Ipomoea batatas, I. reptans, and Manihot utilissima . In the wild, the species reportedly feeds on fallen fruit, including wild figs (Ficus spp.), and the leaves and buds of a variety of plants.	Java . Several biogeographic reviews failed to list the genus for Bali , an island directly east of Java with strong biogeographic affinities to the latter. A sighting was, however, reported from Bali Barat National Park, in a birdwatching trip report. Given the live-animal trade of this species on Java , further records are needed to confirm whether or not there is a native population of the genus on Bali . If there is, biogeographic considerations suggest it would be most closely related to the Javan population and quite probably conspecific.	https://zenodo.org/record/5721299/files/figure.png	Observations in captivity suggest that the species is nocturnal, and during the day rests in a quiet, cool, shaded spot. It becomes active around 16:00 h or 17:00 h in the afternoon.	Dakkus (1932), Dobroruka (1967), Doctors van Leeuwen (1921), van Dort (1986, 1988), Duckworth et al.

A study of ectoparasites based on 77 captured specimens indicated preference for disturbed forests near agricultural plots of corn, yucca, coffee, and citrus fruits. It was mainly captured in trees preserved to provide shade for crops. All individuals were obtained from tree holes well above the ground and in trees mainly near rivers and covered with epiphytes that otherwise housed a large arboreal mammal community.

The Atlantic Bamboo Ratis large and arboreal, with coarse fur and predominantly rufous brown or buffy dorsum. Belly is pure white and contrasts sharply with dorsum. Blocky head is covered with more gray to buff hairs; nose and chin are white. Robusttail is c.120% of head-body length, furred along its length, and covered with long whitish or grayish hairs. Tail is bicolored, pale below and dark brown above at base and becomes dusky to white toward tip. Ears are relatively short. Black vibrissae are long and coarse, with mystacial ones reaching posteriorly to shoulders. Forefeet have four digits, with digit two and three nearly twice the length offirst or fourth digits; all toes have nails rather than claws. Hindfeet have five digits, with reduced hallux but similar medial digit proportions. Palmar and plantar surfaces are orange. Compared with the two other dactylomyine genera, the Atlantic Bamboo Rat has several unique craniodental features, including shortened muzzle, nearly parallel maxillary tooth rows, tetralophodont cheekteeth, large dP, tooth with a well-developed anteroconid, and labial and lingualflexi that remain separate or wear to U-shaped fold rather than Yor V-shaped folds. Chromosomal complement is 2n = 98 and FN = 126. . theWorld of Mammals the of Handbook Habitat. Primary forest, especially along riparian corridors, and old secondary growth with diverse bamboo understory from sea level to elevations of ¢.900 m. Primary forest habitats include native bamboo such as Chusquea bambusoides, Guadua sp. , and Merostachys sp. ( Poaceae ); those in disturbed habitats are primarily introduced Phyllostachys sp. and Bambusa sp. ( Poaceae ). Most important food items of Atlantic Bamboo Rats include large terminal or small lateral shoots, dry bamboo stems or sheets and leaves, or small green branches. They can consume 100 g (fresh weight) of bamboo tissues per night—a food rich in water and cyanide toxins and low nutritive content. While feeding, individuals remove outer, hard, and spiny sheet from culms using their incisors while holding branches with specialized hands and feet, and subsequently consuming inner tissues of shoots by directed chewing. They also forage on dry, spineless sheets found at bases of lateral branches, holding them with their forefeet while chewing. Leaves are cut at petioles from bases of lateral branches with incisors, while holding the branch with one hand, and then held by the other forefoot during consumption. A large shoot can weight 1600 g (including sheet) and at least one-fourth of the inner part can be eaten in a single night. The Atlantic Bamboo Rat has a simple, acidic stomach to detoxify bamboo cyanides. These bamboo rats can be located at night from piles of partially consumed bamboo materials that have fallen on the ground and by grinding sounds made while an individual masticates hard materials.			Atlantic Bamboo Rats are arboreal and mainly active at night, but they have been observed feeding and calling at sunset.	Costa et al.

In Peru, some specimens were collected in a thicket of Bambusa ( Poaceae ) bamboo and small trees. The Bolivian Bamboo Rat occurred at higher elevations than the Amazon Bamboo Rat, but the possibility that they overlap in headwater habitats needs further study.	Stomach contents of Bolivian Bamboo Rats from La Reserva, Bolivia, indicate an exclusively bamboo diet, with remains of sprouts and epidermis present. Field observations of foraging behavior indicate that the Bolivian Bamboo Rat removes the sheet of a bamboo shoot to access inner parts, putting aside piles of unconsumed material. Other observations include some traces of bamboo leaf consumption and gnawed holes on bamboo stems near internodes.			The Bolivian Bamboo Rat is nocturnal, with activity usually starting at dusk and terminating an hour or so before dawn. During the day, individuals use rest sites in dense vegetation on perimeter of their home range. In Bolivia, three rest sites were recorded for one individual: one in a Attalea ( Arecaceae ) palm in riparian forest near the water edge and two at 10-25 m high in dense vines surrounding tree trunks.

Coypus feed preferentially on semi-aquatic and aquatic plants but opportunistically may consume waterside terrestrial vegetation, especially in winter. Dietary items include stems, leaves, roots, and sometime bark; they sometimes use immersed branches or logs as feeding platforms. Forepaws are used to manipulate and hold food items. In Chile, Coypus consumed 700-1500 g (mean 1100 g) of plant matter per day, which represent daily intake equalto ¢.25% of body mass. Where populations occur near agricultural plots, individuals can be responsible for considerable damage by consuming cereals or other cultivated plants. Coypus are coprophagous in natural and captive situations, an activity usually performed at night.			The Coypu is essentially nocturnal, with activity usually initiated at dusk and ending before daylight in early morning. Most daily activity is spent feeding, swimming, and grooming. During hottest period of the day, Coypus sleep in their burrows, in the sun, in the water, or on their feeding platforms. Individuals build burrows with multiple entrances; some tunnels are 6 m in length (range 1-6 m).	Abbas (1991), Bertolino et al. (2005), Borgnia et al.

This wide trophic habitat spectrum makes Desmarest’s Hutia s one of the most adaptable echimyids. Some populations have specializations for red mangrove habitats, where they become nearly arboreal compared with their terrestrial and scansorial counterparts in other Cuban habitats. Usually, Desmarest’s Hutias favor limestone cliffs or karst systems where they can find suitable resting sites. In forest habitats, they most commonly use tree cavities as shelters, but they also build nests in vines or liana tangles among branches.	Desmarest’s Hutias usually forage on tender leaves,leaving leaf petioles on trees and primarily focusing on limbs. They also consume marine crustaceans, mollusks, and algae. They were reported to hunt and eat small Anolis lizards (A. porcatus and A. sagrei), human leftovers, and different food items encountered on their home ranges. Desmarest’s Hutias that live in red mangroves are strictly arboreal and specialize on red mangrove leaves. Several populations occur on small keys, where they are often seen swimming or foraging near the water. R. Borroto and C. A. Woods in 2012 followed populations of the different subspecies, recording detailed records of their foraging behaviors and proportions of plant items consumed. In southern Isla de la Juventud, subspecies ciprianoiforaged on 14 plant families, including 14 species, preferring species in the subclass Rosidae (65%). In coastal and sub-coastal vegetation communities in the Cabo Corrientes Natural Reserve, subspecies pilorides foraged on 15 families, including 20 species, also preferring Rosidae (45%) but also eating substantial proportions of Arecidae (20%) and Dilleniidae (15%). In secondary habitats in Sierra del Chorillo, pilorides foraged on 35 species, including 22 shrubs, with Rosidae (50-8%) and Asteridae (21%) being the most common food items. Coprophagy also appears to be common.			Desmarest’s Hutia is essentially nocturnal, with some crepuscular activity. Individuals are occasionally seen moving about during the day, especially in captivity. In some areas, individuals are arboreal and diurnal, staying at the sun and foraging on leaves on the ground. The activity patterns vary depending on habitats occupied.

The Hispaniolan Hutia favors crevices and tree holes as resting sites. It is reportedly more common near tree holes and large root system oftrees such as Didymopanax tremulus ( Araliaceae ). In the Dominican Republic, it has been reported to build nests in strangler figs ( Ficus , Moraceae ).	The Hispaniolan Hutia primarily feeds on plants, including cultivars, and has been reported to cause damage to farms. Its natural diet includes bark of twigs and branches on upper parts of trees. In Haiti, individuals favor avocados (e.g. Persea anomala, Lauraceae ) and also feed on its bark, leaves, buds, and fruit. Robust cranial structure, gut morphology, and jaw muscles suggest that it specializes on bark consumption. It was reported to forage on 20 species of plants in Haiti. Opportunistically, captive individuals also ate lizards (Anolis sp.).			Hispaniolan Hutias are strictly nocturnal, emerging from their crevices or tree holes at night.

Cuvier’s Spiny-rat also occurs in abandon gardens and second-growth forests. It is usually more abundant than the Guyenne Spiny-rat in early successional forest and edge-dominated habitats in the Guianan region. In French Guiana, most Cuvier’s Spiny-rats were captured on the ground, but two were captured in liana tangles up to 1 m aboveground. There it was found in well-drained primary forest, creekside forest, and secondary vegetation beside logs, at bases of trees, amongstilt roots, on top of logs, and under masses of fallen branches. Cuvier’s Spiny-rat is broadly sympatric with the Guyenne Spiny-rat throughout the Guianan region and northern Brazilian Amazon, and it may co-occur with up to four other species of Proechimys along Rio Jurua in western Brazil, including actual syntopy with up to three other species on the same terra firma trap lines.	Cuvier’s Spiny-rat has been reported to eat fruit, insect and seeds.

Status and Conservation. Classified as Least Concern on The IUCN Red List. Cuvier’s Spiny-rat is widespread and occurs in several forest types, including those modified by humans, and in protected areas. It is unlikely to be declining. Additional studies on distribution, habitat, abundance, ecology, and conservation threats to Cuvier’s Spinyrat are needed.

In the northernmost part of the range, Wolverines (Gulo gulo), Eurasian Lynxes (Lynx lynx), Gray Wolves (Canis lupus), and foxes (Vulpes spp.) are the main predators, in that order; in Yakutia, the Yellow-throated Marten (Mantesflavigula) tends to be the most important. They are heavily infested with ectoparasites, including mites and fleas, and in the Far East, 100% are infested with larvae of Cordylobia inexspectata ( Calliphoridae ), a fly related to blowflies, a single individual musk-deer having as many as 2000 larvae.	In the northern part of the range, Siberian Musk-deer feed on lichens all year round, these forming 60-91% of the weight of stomach contents; in winter, they also eat sprigs of small bushes, conifer needles, moss, dry grass, and rhododendron leaves; in spring and summer, they eat vascular plants.			They are active, nervous animals; sudden high lookout jumps are made, especially by females. Most activity takes place at dusk and dawn. A musk-deer can travel 3-7 km during night foraging, usually returning to the same lair every morning. An individual’s home range will be between 200 ha and 300 ha in size, and muskdeer observe the boundaries quite strictly. In the second half of winter the extent of the home range is ratherless, and seasonal migrations,if they exist at all, are minimal.	Flerov (1952), MacKinnon (2008), Nyambayar et al.

Chinese Alpine Musk-deer live in highelevation bush, where the mean annual temperature is around 3-7°C and often falls below freezing; they prefer shrubby habitats to meadows. They inhabit shaded slopes with better shelter and less disturbance, the steeper slopes at greater than 30°. The elevation of their habitat is typically 4000-4500 m, only sometimes going below 4000 m . Annual rainfall varies from about 200 mm to as much as 450 mm or more. Musk-deer population density varies from 3-9 ind/km? in the more arid habitats to 71-11 ind/km? where the rainfall is highest; density is lower where there is heavy snow cover. Densities in dwarf forest and shrub are highest, but more continuous dense shrub is avoided, and patchy shrub has the highest densities among habitat types. Where there are more competitors, such as Serow and Goral, and more grazing by domestic herds, and of course more poaching, densities are again lower.	The diet contains the leaves of 46 species (mostly shrubs and forbs), flowers of 30 species, shoots and stems of 16 species, and seeds ofsix species; the proportion of leaves and tender shoots is highest in spring and summer, of buds and flowers higher in late summer, and of the leaves, twigs, and seeds of forbs and shrubs higher later in the year.			Very little is known about activity patterns, but they have been reported to sleep during the day in a form, which is made by scraping out a shallow depression in the ground, which just fits the body when the animalis crouching low.

In Sikkim, where the treeline is higher because of the more evenly humid climate, they live between 2500 m and 4400 m ; in Bhutan and Arunachal Pradesh, the habitat 1s between 2600 m and 3000 m in thick bamboo forest. In Kedarnath, musk-deer tend to be in the open pastures on northern slopes at night. These slopes are warmer, more sheltered, and less exposed during the night. They are found on warmer, more sunny southern slopes during the day, when they rest more in shrub cover. The preferred slope angle is 30—-40°.	Diet in winter consists 39% of leaves of trees and shrubs (half of this being Rhododendron), 16% forbs (half of this being Senecio), 7% grasses, 2% ferns, 15% moss, and 21% lichen. In spring and summer, the diet consists mostly of forbs and lichen; it is mostly forbs and leaves in autumn. This contrasts with the Siberian Muskdeer, whose diet is so heavily composed oflichen.	Known from the southern slopes of Himalayas in N India (including Sikkim ), Nepal , and Bhutan .	https://zenodo.org/record/5720527/files/figure.png	Overall, 41% of the time is spent active, mainly at night, 59% resting, mainly by day. They are relatively silent, but hiss when alarmed; they squeal when captured or attacked by a predator. Males make a metallic rustling noise, probably by tooth grinding, in aggressive interactions. There is a contact bleat of the young to its mother. Stotting, like a gazelle,is frequent during vigilance behavior. Females seem to be more wary than males, and often flee for up to 100 m before stopping and looking back; males have a shorter median flight distance, but they hiss less and tend to look back more when fleeing. In males, the flight distance seems to be greater ( 30 m ) in autumn, in the rut, than in winter and spring, when it is only 15-20 m.	Green (1985, 1986, 1987), Groves et al. (1995), Grubb (1982).

Mountain Beavers are found more frequently in deciduous than coniferous forests. The Mountain Beaver generally constructs its burrow close to water sources, often allowing it to flood parts of the tunnel system.	The Mountain Beaveris primarily folivorous. Bracken fern (Pteridium aquilinum) and sword fern (Polystichum munitum) are staples of their diet yearround, but they also eat leaves, bark, and twigs of a variety of other plants as available, apparently specializing in plants toxic to other herbivores. When other food sources are scarce in winter, conifer stems and needles are important sources of food, despite their poor food quality. The Mountain Beaver will pull entire plants underground for consumption, but it will also climb a few metersinto trees to collect and eat stems and leaves. In autumn, hay piles are constructed outside burrow entrances that are used for nesting material and food. The Mountain Beaver also requires abundant water because its inability to concentrate urine limits dehydration tolerance.			The Mountain Beaver, like many fossorial animals, is cathemeral, being active for several bouts of foraging in a 24hour period;it seems to be most active at night. It does not hibernate, although it is rarely active aboveground in winter.	Camp (1918), Carraway & Verts (1993), Cox & Faulkes (2014), Dice (1932), Druzinsky (2010), Fellers et al.

On mainland, this species was found on sandy and stony soils in dense heathland, open shrubland, open woodland, thickets of Allocasuarina ( Casuarinaceae ), and dense forest vegetation in riparian areas. Nest constructed from grass or other locally sourced materials within deep depression that is dug under cover of dense shrubs; only one opening may be present, but flimsy construction of nest allows animals to burst through at any point if disturbed.	Insects, other invertebrates, seeds, fruits, and occasionally small vertebrates are eaten, shifts between seasons probably reflecting changes in food availability. Like other peramelids,this species obtainsits food on orjust below the ground surface, digging conical holes to 20-25 cm to obtain buried prey.			Animals rest by day in their nest and emerge at dusk to begin foraging. Activity continues until dawn in winter, but may cease several hours before daybreak in summer.	Abbott (2006), Ashby et al.

In Victoria, it inhabited perennial tussock grassland mixed with areas of savanna woodland and, until recently, could be found in semi-natural situations such as golf courses, gardens, parks, and farmland near urban settlement. In Tasmania, this bandicoot occurs in native and exotic grasslands, woodland, and open forest with a grassy understory, and also in farmland and cultivated cropland. Nest is lined and constructed from grass and other debris in depression on ground surface or under cover of shrubs.	Some food is taken from the ground surface, including seeds, fallen fruits, insects, and small vertebrates, and some is excavated. Animals use their strong and stoutly clawed forefeet to dig conical holes to depths of 15-20 cm, uncovering earthworms, larvae, bulbs, tubers, roots, and subterranean fungi. Diet changes seasonally, reflecting shifts in the availability of different foods throughoutthe year.	N & E Tasmania including Bruny I; persists also (very small numbers) in extreme SE Australia (S Victoria).	https://zenodo.org/record/6621756/files/figure.png	This bandicootis strictly nocturnal. Individuals emerge at dusk or after dark and exhibit several peaks of activity during the night. Most time is spent in foraging, but males probably spend relatively more time than females in patrolling their home ranges. Animals return to their nests before dawn.

It is absent from woodland and savanna habitats of the Trans-Fly and probably also from low-lying floodplain of Sepik River. Despite its preference for undisturbed forest, this bandicoot may occur also in mature secondary forest and old gardens, and has been recorded in lowland rainforest at altitudes as low as 50-60 m. On Huon Peninsula it has been recorded at 3900 m; here, trees are stunted or absent, and vegetation is dominated by herbs, shrubs, tree ferns, and tussock grassland. Nest sites have not been described in any detail, but anecdotal accounts suggest that the animals rest temporarily under piles of leaf litter and other debris in sheltered sites on forest floor.	Has been anecdotally reported to eat figs and fallen pandan fruits ( Pandanus , Pandanaceae ). There is no quantitative information on the diet but, as with many other peramelids,it is assumed to be omnivorous.			Radio-tracking of a single male showed the animal to be inactive on eight of ten occasions when it was located by day, but active on all ten occasions when tracked between 19:00 h and 02:00 h.

Omnivorous, and eats wide variety of invertebrates, small vertebrates such as lizards and birds, and their eggs, also fruits, seeds, plant roots, storage organs, and green plant material, as well as underground fungi. Like other members of the genus, this bandicoot forages on ground surface but also uses its powerful forelimbsto dig for food, leaving behind characteristically conical holes that may descend to depth of 30 cm. The diet varies with locality and season, suggesting that animals track and eat different prey types according to their availability.			Individuals emerge after dark and are active for most of night, covering wide range of habitats in their search for food; males may patrol areas on edge of their home range, especially during the long breeding season. The day is usually spent in resting in the nest or under shelter, but occasional movements have been recorded in early morning orjust before dusk in rugged sandstone country on Groote Eylandt.

It occurs also on the edges of swamps and in riparian habitats where dense ground-level vegetation is present, creating tunnels and runs or using those constructed by other mammals. Recently burnt sites may be exploited for the regenerating food and shelter resources that they provide. Simple nests are formed under dense vegetation, under the skirts of grass trees (Xanthorrhoea spp., Xanthorrhoeaceae ), and occasionally in shallow burrows; plantlitter, soil, and other debris may be used as construction materials to help enclose the nest. This species used to occur in more open habitats, but is probably restricted to areas with dense ground cover that provide shelter from introduced predators such as the Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes) and the domestic cat (Felis catus).	Insects, small vertebrates (lizards, frogs, rodents), bird eggs, fruit, green plant material, and fungi are all eaten. In several studies invertebrates have been the dominant food item, but the relative importance of each food type varies with season and locality. Most foraging occurs at night, animals using their hearing to detect surface-active prey and their sense of smell to detect buried prey. Digs characteristic conical holes in topsoil when buried prey has been located, providing a ready and reliable means of determining whether the species is present at a site.			In the wild, usually nocturnal. Animals emerge an hour or more after dusk and appear to spend most of their active time in foraging. Captive individuals are strictly nocturnal and have been recorded as spending 71% of the 24hour day at rest in their nests.	Ashby et al.

In its remnant mainland distribution it occurs in tussock grassland and low woodland dominated by Acacia ( Fabaceae ) and Eucalyptus spp. ( Myrtaceae ), often on sandy soils, but also on rugged sandstone habitats. Shows a strong association with hummock grass on Barrow Island, often burrowing under hummocks for shelter, but on Marchinbar Island prefers low heath or shrubland on sand or sandstone. Sometimes found in vine thicket and patches of rainforest, but these do not appear to be preferred habitats. Nest can be a shallow scrape under rock or other shelter, or simple structure constructed from grass and other local materials; constructed on ground surface, under grass hummock and dense shrubs or, on Barrow, in limestone cave. Individuals use different shelters on different days, and visit varied habitats by night when foraging, but generally occupy stable ranges that change little between seasons.	Invertebrates represent a larger part of diet compared with those of both larger congeners, with beetles, termites, ants, centipedes, and insect larvae consumed. In addition, it eats seeds, roots, tubers, fruits, and other plant material, especially in dry season, and small rodents and lizards also may be eaten. Perhaps because of the diverse habitats that it uses for foraging, including ocean beaches, this species includes in its diet items that are unusual for peramelids, such as washed-up cephalopods and turtle eggs. Conical-shaped pits in sandy soils indicate where foraging has taken place.			Rests by day in a nest or temporary shelter and emerges after dusk when conditions are dark. Radio-tracking studies indicate that activity can be maintained continuously throughout the night, although animals are usually most active 3—4 hours after dusk and in the hour or so before dawn. Up to 10 ha may be covered each night, although 1-5 ha is more usual. Animals return to their shelters before daybreak.	Bradshaw et al. (1994), Burbidge et al. (1988), Close et al.

It occupies similar habitats in Australia, but occurs there also in coastal closed heath and extends into drier country along gallery forest, from sea level to 800 m. May rest in logs or under leaflitter in sheltered sites in a similar manner to that of other peramelids, but present species also shows considerable propensity to construct burrows. In Australia, burrow complexes may be 50-80 cm deep, cover up to 3 m? in area, and have two or more entrances.	In the most detailed study of the diet of this echymipera, at Iron Range, on Cape York Peninsula,fruits and seeds comprised ¢.27% of diet, followed by invertebrates (26%), fungi (19%), and the remains ofleafy plants (18%); other foods included plant roots and soil, grass, and small vertebrates. Pronounced seasonal variation in the amount of each food type consumed probably reflected changes in food availability. More limited information for New Guinea suggests that diet there is similar. Food obtained from forest floor or by excavation; as with many other peramelids, this species’ presence can often be detected by the finding of conical holes 20-30 cm deep that the animals have dug with their powerful forelimbs.			Rests by day, and is believed to be strictly nocturnal in both its Australian and its New Guinean ranges.

It prefers secondary forest, grassland, and garden habitats nearvillages, rather than primary forest, and at higher elevations is restricted increasingly to disturbed habitats. Recorded also as using canegrass thickets, sago swamps, and coffee and banana plantations. Radio-tracking studies show that animals exploitsites with recent tree-falls, fallen fruit, rotting logs, and dense ground-level vegetation for foraging, and use sites on forest floor for nests. They do not have fixed preferences for a particular type of nest; they nest in hollow logs, tree stumps, piles of leaves, and balls of grass, and in shallow, deliberately constructed burrows with two openings that run for up to 4 m below forest floor.	The few stomachs that have been examined suggest that this species, while omnivorous, may consume more fruit than other well-studied peramelids. Local people often set traps or wait by fruiting trees to capture foraging animals, and diet samples have been found to contain seeds and pulp from such fruits as banana, fig, and pandan ( Pandanus , Pandanaceae ). Nonetheless, the species also eats snails or slugs, surface-active invertebrates, and prey such as larvae in rotting wood. Shallow foraging pits indicate that subterranean prey, such as earthworms, are also eaten. There is some evidence that foraging is focused in areas with dense cover, animals moving quickly through open sites to access new sources of food.			In Crater Mountain Wildlife Management Area, individuals became active between 18:00 h and 20:00 h, showed peak activity between 20:00 h and 02:00 h, and became much less active again between 04:00 h and 06:00 h. About three-quarters of fixes on animals radio-tracked at night indicated that these were active and foraging or were patrolling their homes ranges. In contrast, 86% of radio-fixes obtained by day showed that animals were at rest. In anotherstudy, carried out in Baiyer River Wildlife Sanctuary, Western Highlands Province, animals were strictly nocturnal and often used the same pathways when traveling through the forest. Both studies found that the animals use multiple shelters or nest sites between successive days, and sometimes return to these sites at night for short periods.	Anderson et al.

In the Plains States, these skunks inhabit riparian woodlands and areas of vegetation along fences. They also are found in brushy and rocky habitats, but avoid wetlands. They have been observed on sandy soils and beaches in Florida . Eastern Spotted Skunks seem to prefer habitat with extensive vegetative cover, as this cover provides protection from various predators. They den in protected, dark, dry holes including natural crevices in trees, and will den off the ground to an elevation of seven meters in hollow trees. They dig their own burrows, or den in holes previously occupied by other animals, in talus slopes, haystacks, under houses or rocks, and in the walls of houses or barns. They prefer warm holes in the winter and cool dens in the summer, and will change den sites to accommodate these needs.	Eastern Spotted Skunks forage primarily at night. They are secretive and not often seen. These skunks are exceptional mousers and do farmers a great service when they forage around barns and buildings. They are omnivores, but tend to be more carnivorous than Mephitis or Conepatus . The diet consists mainly of insects, small mammals, birds, and birds’ eggs. Like a center hiking an American football, the skunk uses its front paws to throw an egg through its back legs in order to crack the shell. These skunks also will eat fruits and vegetables in the summer and fall when they are available.			They are generally nocturnal. They usually avoid moonlit nights. On nights when the moon is not out they normally have two periods of activity. They will come out soon after sunset and again before sunrise. They will be active throughout the night as well. Eastern Spotted Skunks have been observed during the day on rare occasions. Spotted skunks are quite agile and are capable of climbing. This agility also can be observed in their threat behavior as they are able to perform front handstands. When faced with a potential predator, the skunk rushes forward, then stands on its forepaws with its hind end elevated off the ground. This behavior has been reported to last for up to eight minutes in short, 2-5 second bursts of handstanding. However, a young, captive animal from a wildlife rehabilitation effort was observed crouching under a couch on all fours until a domestic cat came into the room. The skunk rushed out from under the couch toward the cat. As soon as its tail cleared the cushion it went into a handstand/run. The cat began to trot away. The skunk followed on its frontfeet, bouncing around a table, about 1-5 m and then jumped up on a stand approximately 6 cm off the ground, ran along the stand, hopped off the end and continued to chase the cat to the other end of the room. The cat finally ran off and the skunk dropped down on all fours and went back under the couch. Spotted skunks have been reported to spray from the hand-stand position, but they usually drop down and face the predator with both ends in a “U” shape. The handstand is usuallyjust a threat behavior used to drive off the predator.	Bangs (1898b), Choate et al.

They have been observed in coastal sand dunes with only herbaceous vegetation for cover. They have a patchy distribution, but nearly all individuals have been captured in coastal habitats. However, remains have been found in owl pellets about 115 km from the coast at an altitude of 500 m . They are found from sea level up to 1630 m , but are generally found below 350 m . Pygmy Spotted Skunksare scarce, but if enough habitat is preserved, they are believed to be able to survive in disturbed environments.	Pygmy Spotted Skunks are opportunistic feeders and consume a variety of invertebrates. Rodents are not taken as frequently as by other spotted skunks, but may be selected as alternative prey when the availability of arthropods is low. Spiny pocket mice are common in the tropical dry forest, and during the dry season, their density is high. During this season rodents also may be easier to detect due to the desiccation ofleaflitter. Birds are rarely taken by these skunks and plant material is less likely to be consumed, although, highly digestible fruits may be eaten. Pygmy Spotted Skunks use food sources such as ants, beetles, and spiders in relation to their abundance in the environment. However, some invertebrates, such as insect larvae, millipedes and centipedes, are selected in higher abundance. True bugs (Hemiptera) tend to be avoided as do crickets and grasshoppers (Orthoptera). Pygmy Spotted Skunks will eat cockroaches (Blattaria) during the dry season; they may select food items in response to seasonal variation in prey abundance.			They are nocturnal and den underground or in fallen logs, among rocks, or simply under dense vegetation. They will use dens dug by other animals such as gophers, squirrels, armadillos, and turtles. They use pathways and stream beds to move to and from bodies of water. Much of their activity occurs below the leaf litter or brush, where they search for the burrows of small rodents. Pygmy Spotted Skunks stomp their feet when threatened. They have been observed doing a partial handstand similar to other species of spotted skunks. Anal secretions are usually only released as a last resort.	Cantu-Salazar (2002), Cantu-Salazar, Fernandez & Hidalgo-Mihart (2004), Cantu-Salazar, Hidalgo-Mihart et al.

It is most common in arid lowlands, but also occurs in deciduous or ponderosa forest, forest edges, pastures, rocky canyons, and riparian habitats. Hooded Skunks use similar habitats to Striped Skunks, but are found more often in scrub and urban habitats. Hooded Skunks occur from sea level to 3110 m , in low elevation desert areas (below 2500 m ), in rocky canyons, or in heavily vegetated streamsides and valleys, often in association with mesquite, pine—oak, and other shrubs and grasses. Hooded Skunks appearto prefer intermediate elevationsin rockyslopes,at the bases ofcliffs, or on the rocky sides of arroyos, but are also encountered in heavy growth of weeds and shrubs in riparian areas. Dense, brushy cover of stream sides may be important for this species. Hooded Skunks den in holes dug in the ground, rock crevices, and holes in logs. They have even been observed denning more than 1 m above ground in trees, but they are more likely to den on rocky hillsides. They prefer woodland habitats more than do Striped Skunks. In agricultural areas Hooded Skunks den along fencerows, beneath irrigation canals, and in heavily vegetated areas along streams. Hooded Skunks are less likely than Striped Skunks to den around human dwellings. However, radio-collared individuals were frequently located under buildings and sheds and in culverts.	The diet of this species consists primarily of insects (including beetles and grasshoppers), fruits, small vertebrates, and birds’ eggs. Hooded Skunks break chicken eggs by throwing them between their back legs rather than biting them. Vertebrates are taken opportunistically. When foraging, Hooded Skunk moves slowly, snuffling among leaves and pouncing on grasshoppers and beetles.			Hooded Skunks remain active all year and have been trapped in the winter. The anal glands are used in self defense. One animal was observed spraying nine times in eleven seconds and again three more times 90 minutes later. The defensive behavior of Hooded Skunk is similar to that of Striped Skunk. Hooded Skunks are active after dusk and travel along rock walls, streambeds, and in weedy fields. They tend to be solitary except when females are raising young, although several may dine together at a feeding station. Females normally do not den together during the winter months.

They can be found in open, exposed arcas, but prefer brushy, weedy stream and gulch bottoms or canyons. In open areas they will burrow into banks or even level ground and as a result are able to occupy many habitats. Other habitats where they can be found include a mixture of woodlands, brushy corners, and open fields broken by wooded ravines and rocky outcrops. They will also utilize cultivated areas, pasture, and hay crops. In other parts of their range they use wetlands surrounded by agricultural areas, grasslands, woodlot edges, fencelines, and refuse piles. Striped Skunks may not have a preference for any particular habitat as long as food and shelter are available.	Striped Skunks are opportunistic omnivores. With the exception of lima beans, most skunks will eat almost anything. They will feast primarily on insects, such as beetles, grasshoppers, crickets, moths, cutworms, caterpillars, bees, and wasps. They also will eat earthworms, snakes, snails, clams, crayfish, fish, frogs, mice, moles, rats, squirrels, wild fruits, grains, corn, nuts, birds’ eggs, carrion, and garbage. Striped Skunks use their long foreclawsto dig for insects and grubs. They will search in rotten or fallen logs for mice and insects. Around gardens they will forage forripe fruits and vegetables, but they primarily are looking for insects, and benefit gardeners by eating insects that can damage garden crops. They also will take advantage of any pet food left outside.			Striped Skunks are crepuscular or nocturnal. In the northern part of their range they may go into a torpor (they are not true hibernators) during cold spells or when snow coveris particularly deep. However, in the southern parts of the range, they may actually be more active during the milder winters. When a Striped Skunk perceives a threat,its first responseis to run away. If that does not work, it will spray a noxious chemical from the anal scent glands. However, before spraying, skunks use a series of threat behaviors. They will stomp the ground with both front feet. Sometimes they will charge forward a few paces and then stomp or will edge backwards while dragging their front feet, all the while with the tail up in the air. Each scent gland has a nipple associated with it and skunks can aim and direct the spray with highly coordinated muscle control. When a skunk is being chased by a predator, but cannot see the predator, the spray is emitted as an atomized cloud that the predator must run through. This is the “shotgun” method and usually is enough to deter most predators.	Bailey (1931), Baird (1857), Bangs (1895, 1898a), Bentler et al. (2007), Blanton et al.

They prefer to den in flat or rolling topography. These skunks will den in shallow caves, below tree roots, in hollow trees, under rocks and cracks between stones, and in abandoned tunnels of other animals. They will use habitat from desert areas to forests. In addition to being found in shrub or forest cover, they use man-made structures, denning under buildings and woodpiles. They use areas with natural herbaceous vegetation, except where poisons are used to control the Culpeo (Pseudalopex culpaeus). They are susceptible to poisoning although not targeted. They do however, prefer more open, grassy areas compared to the drier shrubby environments.	These skunks are opportunistic feeders and usually capture their prey easily. They generally find their prey by sniffing and digging, using their flexible noses and long claws, primarily in grassy habitats. Like other skunks in the genus they eat a variety of insects, including ground beetles and their larvae, grasshoppers, crickets, and spiders. They will consume fruit when it is available. These skunks also eat a variety of vertebrates, such as lizards and rodents. Carrion is eaten in larger quantities than expected based on relative abundance, when compared with other food items. This would suggest that this species is more carnivorous than insectivorous, but still opportunistic. They also are known to frequent urban garbage sites and vegetable gardens.			This species is generally nocturnal or crepuscular in nature. Humboldt’s Hog-nosed Skunks become more active during the day as winter approaches, and are less active when there is snow cover. They use a variety of den sites during the day and normally do not use the same den site for more than a couple of days at a time. They will however, reuse dens that they occupied previously. They are active for about 50% of the day. Their activity period starts between 20:00-22:00 h and continues until 07:00 h the next morning. Some skunks will remain active until 09:00 h and even until 12:00 h. They rarely are seen between 12:00-19:00 h. During periods of activity they have been observed digging or foraging, walking, and even playing. Young animals will venture as far as 1-3 km from their natal dens to survey new territory before returning home. They may eventually relocate to the areas they investigated.	Arias et al.

They prefer not to hang out in areas that have prolonged dry seasons. During the wet season they spend more time on higher ground in deciduousforests. Clearings and pastures near evergreen forests also are frequented by this species. Den sites are dug among tree roots or fallen trees. Burrows are about 1-2 m in length and about 0-3 m below the surface. When not using the burrows dug for themselves these skunks will use burrows dug by other animals such as armadillos.	Like other hog-nosed skunks,this species is an opportunistic omnivore. They feed on many invertebrates, but may not dig as much as the other species. Additionally, they consume small vertebrates, including reptiles, mammals, and birds, as well as fruits when they are available.			Striped Hog-nosed Skunks are primarily nocturnal. They become active shortly after sunset. One animal was reported to become active between 19:30 h and 24:00 h and stay out for about six hours at a time. The phase of the moon appeared not to affect activity periods. Though it is not outside the realm of possibility, these skunks rarely are seen during daylight hours.

They have been found from the Paraguayan Chaco to the precordillerean steppe. They forage in grassland, savannas, steppe, and canyons, and den in shrub forests and in talus slopes. Dens in rocky areas are usually found in crevices. Elsewhere, they burrow into the ground, sometimes at the roots of trees, to construct dens. They will also den in caves and use burrows abandoned by other animals. They tend to avoid heavily forested areas. In fact, their populations may increase in areas where forests have been cleared.	Like other skunks, is an omnivorous and opportunistic feeder. Invertebrates constitute the bulk of the diet, but small vertebrates, including frogs, lizards, rodents, and birds as well as bird and reptile eggs are consumed. More vertebrates are consumed during winter months when arthropods are harder to find. Otherwise the diet is similar year round. Arthropod prey items include beetle larvae and spiders. Beetles are found in abundance in skunk faeces even when beetles in the environment are more scarce, suggesting that beetles are a favorite food item.			These skunks are considered to be crepuscular, but can be active throughout the night with their activity usually starting between 19:00 h and 22:00 h. They are active most of the night and settle early in the morning, before 05:00 h. Much of their time is spent searching for food either by digging up insects or sniffing and searching around brush. They tend to dig less in winter when the ground is frozen.	Anderson (1997), Arias et al. (2006), Cabrera (1958), Cabrera & Yepes (1960), Canevari & Ambrosini (1988), Donadio et al.

They also are found in open desertscrub and mesquite-grasslands. In the southcentral part of their range they can be found in tropical areas as well as in mountains and coastal plains. They also are known to visit cornfields surrounded by brush or grassy plains, and scattered thickets of bull-horn acacia and other thorny plants. They can be found in both thorn woodland and riparian forest. In thorn woodland, the trees can vary in density from sparse to thick enough to form a loose canopy. Trees associated with the riparian forest habitat include pecan (Carya illinoensis), sycamore (Platanus occidentalis), Texas persimmon (Diospyros texana), and live-oak (Quercus virginiana). The understory of the riparian forests where hog-nosed skunks have been found includes briers, tall grasses, and tall weeds. American Hog-nosed Skunks have been found in pine—oak forest in the San Carlos Mountains, and north of these mountains on the Tamaulipan plain, which consists of low scrub and cacti. They also can occur in mesquitebrushland and improved pasture habitat where a few areas of semi-open native grassland have been used exclusively for cattle ranching. Thorny brush and cactus constitute the predominant vegetation in the region of southern Texas where these skunks occur.	They have been observed attacking and devouring small rodents. However, this species is more insectivorous by nature and will spend hours digging for grubs and larvae. They also will eat pears, raisins, squash, green beans, radishes, green peppers, and a variety of other fruits and vegetables (with the exception of lima beans). Naturalists have trouble finding bait suitable for trapping these carnivores and have often had to capture individuals by hand. These skunks also may be capable of obtaining their daily water requirements from their food depending on the moisture content of the menu.			These skunks are solitary and largely nocturnal, but not strictly so. They have been observed feeding during the heat of the day in New Mexico and Texas . They den in hollows in the roots of trees or fallen trunks and in cavities under rocks, and will take refuge in prickly pear cactus when aggravated. When an American Hognosed Skunk is threatened by a predator,its first response is to flee to cover. It may then turn to face its pursuer and, depending on the size and threat ofthe predator, stand on its hindlegs and even take two or three steps forward. Then it will come down hard on its front paws and exhale a burst of air in a loud hiss. Finally, it will draw its paws under its body, flinging dirt backwards. A defensive, frightened individual will crouch, stomp its front paws, raise its tail and hold it flat against its back, and bare its teeth. In this position it can bite and spray a predator, and will do both. American Hognosed Skunk can squirt a noxious liquid from anal scent glands, either as a mist when the threat is not specifically located, or as a stream directed toward a specific threat. The mist can be emitted while on the run.

They have been found in grasslands and grassland/forest mosaics, grassland-shrub, natural damp grassland, and open damp soil along streams. Occasionally, they have been reported in rice fields and freshwater swamp forests where they forage. Shrubs are commonly used for shelter. They also have been seen foraging along roads and paths.	Their diet consists of soft animal matter such as worms of every kind, birds’ eggs, carrion, insects (including crickets and small beetles), and insect grubs. They also consume small freshwater crabs as well as various plant parts. Their mobile snout and long claws are used for finding insects and freshwater molluscs. While foraging, stink badgers move slowly, rooting around in the uppersoil layer using their snout to dig out grubs.	Philippines ( Palawan I, Calamian I).	https://zenodo.org/record/5684755/files/figure.png	Palawan Stink Badger is nocturnal, but has been seen active both day and night. While walking they are ungainly and awkward, but when startled can maintain a steady trot for 90 m . Even at a trot they are no faster than a walking human. Stink badgers walk with left and right feet apart, and hindfeet usually in line with front feet.	Esselstyn et al.

On Borneo this species reportedly inhabits caves. However, they also are known to burrow into the ground to den. They occur in secondary forests and open grounds adjacent to forests.	Captive stink badgers have been observed to consume worms, insects, and the entrails of chickens. Stink badgers in the wild are omnivorous, and consume eggs, carrion, and some vegetable material, in addition to worms and insects. Sunda Stink Badger, when foraging, uses its snout and claws for rooting in the soil in search of food.			Stink badgers are active year-round. They are nocturnal.

They can occur in a variety of habitats such as rainforests, dry thickets, pine forests, and grasslands. They are commonly found in agricultural fields as well. Southern Spotted Skunks have been found from sea level to about 2800 m . They make dens under logs or rocks, in hollow trees, and between the roots of trees and shrubs. They also use dens abandoned by armadillos and other mammals.	Like other spotted skunks, Southern Spotted Skunks feed mainly on insects and small mammals. They also will consume amphibians and wild fruit. 50% of their diet consists of invertebrates and the remainder consists of vertebrates and vegetation (including fruits).			These animals presumably are nocturnal. Like the other skunks they are equipped with anal scent glands that can be used in defense. Southern Spotted Skunks probably have very similar activity patterns to Eastern and Western Spotted Skunks.	Baker & Baker (1975), Ceballos & Oliva (2005), Cervantes et al.

They also occur in all stages of dry forests and pine-oak forests, and use canyons, cliffs, rock piles, lava fields, and dry valleys. They prefer areas where they can find cover protection from predators. These skunks will use tunnels and holes of other animals such as mountain beavers in Oregon and wood rats and ground squirrels in other parts of their range. Western Spotted Skunks have been found in older buildings in rural settings, but also have been taken in urban houses and apartments. They also will den around other man-made structures such as dams as long as protective cover is available.	Western Spotted Skunks eat a variety of food items. They are omnivores, but tend to have a mostly carnivorous diet. They eat small mammals, birds, and lizards. They consume a number of insects including grasshoppers, beetles, caterpillars, and ants. They also will eat fruits and vegetable matter to supplement their diets.			They are generally nocturnal. They prefer to move under the cover of darkness, but have been observed during daylight hours. When nervous they will walk with heavy deliberate steps. Spotted skunks are quite agile and are capable of climbing. Like other spotted skunks, they can perform handstands and walk on only their front paws. When faced with a potential predator, the skunk rushes forward, then stands on its forepaws with its hind end elevated off the ground. It can spray in this position, but usually drops to all fours and faces the predator with both ends before spraying.

It avoids shallow substrates along rocky ridges (which might act as dispersal barriers) and waterlogged areas, but it is found in gardens, orchards, and cultivated lands.	The Robust Golden Moleis insectivorous, mainly feeding on subterranean invertebrates, with a preference for earthworms. It eats a wide variety of living invertebrate and vertebrate prey in captivity, including mealworms, kingworms, earthworms, and young mice, and it ignores dead prey.

They construct two-tiered burrow systems typical of golden moles, with subsurface tunnels for foraging and deeper tunnels (20-80 cm) leading to nesting chambers. Some burrows extend upward into rotting trees, which mightarise from moles foraging for invertebrate prey that are likely to be abundant in these trees or seeking refuge when burrows become waterlogged during heavy rains. Subsurface activity declines in dry winter months when abundance of prey is low. At these times, individuals might enter prolonged torpor spanning several days or confine their foraging to deeper tunnels.	Bronner (1995a, 2000, 2013b), Mynhardt et al. (2015), Rampartab (2015a).

The Hottentot Golden Mole occurs mainly in Grassland and Savanna biomes, with marginal intrusion into Fynbos and Nama Karoo biomes in its southern distribution. It is particularly abundant in moist soils near water sources but also occurs far from surface water if soilis friable enough for burrowing and invertebrate prey is abundant. The Hottentot Golden Mole generally occurs in regions with mean annual rainfall more than 500 mm. It is frequently associated with agricultural land, golf courses, and gardens but less common in exotic plantations.	The Hottentot Golden Mole is insectivorous, mainly feeding on subterranean invertebrates such as earthworms and insects. In captivity, they will eat snails and plant material (e.g. potatoes and bulbs), although their digestive tracts are not specialized for herbivory. In nature, more than 97% of diets contain only earthworms, and less than 3% contain variety of insect prey including carabid beetle larvae, slugs, snails, crickets, insect pupae, and spiders. Individuals can consume up to 90% of their body weight daily. Although they will drink water in captivity, they probably obtain their moisture requirements from food and dew in the wild.			Hottentot Golden Moles live almost exclusively underground, constructing superficial burrows for foraging and deeper permanent burrows for residence. Subsurface tunnels are ¢.3 cm deep and 4-6 cm in diameter. Residential burrows can penetrate as far as 1 m belowground and are relatively complex in form, comprising grassor leaf-lined spherical nesting chambers 10-50 cm deep and 15-20 cm in diameter, other chambers used as latrines, and deeper (29-94 cm deep) spiraling bolt holes. In friable soils, horny nose pads are predominantly used for digging subsurface tunnels, and foreclaws assist with digging deeper tunnels and foraging in heavier soils. Hottentot Golden Moles are estimated to burrow at rates of up to 1-1-5 m/h and up to 9 m daily. Foraging burrows are generally 9.5-240 m long and might be extended by 4-12 m/day, depending on friability of soil and abundance of prey. Excavated soil from deep burrows is pushed up to the surface as molehills or compacted into tunnel walls; superficial foraging burrows result in ridges on the surface. Hottentot Golden Moles are highly sensitive to disturbances and will retreat quickly from superficial burrows to deeper burrows or bolt-holesif disturbed. They sometimes are attracted to the surface by movements of worms and insects, and they might even emerge and move on the surface, usually only at night and when food is scarce. At these times, they can be vulnerable to predation by owls and other predators. Hottentot Golden Moles are significantly less active in winter than summer, burrowing deeper and often entering torpor during colder winter months. They are particularly active after rain, and daily activity tends to peak at sunrise, sunset, and midnight, with periods of activity of up to two hours and periods of inactivity of 3-5 hours. During heavy rainfall events, underground burrows can become flooded. Hottentot Golden Moles cope with these situations by swimming; they can maintain a certain degree of buoyancy due to a layer of air retained in their wet fur. Soil temperatures in burrow systems are 0-8-32°C, but optimal thermal conditions for activity are 23-33°C, corresponding with their thermoneutral zone. Ambient temperatures below 15°C or higher than 30°C lead to torpor, characterized by reduced metabolic rate and considerable energetic saving.	Bernard et al.

Both subspecies have similar microhabitat requirements, preferring soft sands of coastal dune crests but also occurring in interdune valleys with vegetation clumps where sand is not compacted.	Grant’s Golden Mole has been recorded eating sand-burrowing skinks, legless lizards, web-footed geckos, and insects, including crickets and beetle larvae. When feeding on dunes, the Namib Golden Mole eats similar types of food but specializes in eating sand termites (Psammotermes allocerus), which make up 95% of the diet by mass. Root material is also ingested along with sand. It is thought that termite colonies are detected around dune grass with seismic cues. Both subspecies forage on the surface at night, which provides a much more energy efficient form of locomotion than burrowing through the sand, given that prey species are patchily distributed.			Grant's Golden Moles are mostly nocturnal, but some afternoon activity occurs in winter; captive individuals were active at midday. In winter, Grant’s Golden Mole is most active between sunset and midnight; summer activity continues all night.	Bronner (2013b), Fielden (1991), Fielden et al.

When foraging in areas with Greater Sac-winged Bats ( Saccopteryx bilineata ) or Lesser Sac-winged Bats ( S . lepturd ), Chestnut Sac-winged Bats partition space by foraging higher aboveground (5-10 m) or farther from vegetation in gaps and forest edges. It flies faster and in wider circles (20-30 m across) than the Saccopteryx species.	Widely distributed in Central and South America, from E Nicaragua to Panama, W of the Andes to NW Ecuador, and E of Andes from Venezuela and the Guianas to Amazonian Peru, C Brazil and N Bolivia.	https://zenodo.org/record/3747962/files/figure.png	Chestnut Sac-winged Bats are crepuscular. Foraging activity begins at dusk and continues for 10-15 minutes, after which observers found individuals to fly above the canopy and disappear, perhaps moving to different foraging areas. Foraging in the middle of the night is rare, but a secondary foraging period occurs shortly before dawn. The Chestnut Sac-winged Bat roosts in tree hollows of living, rotting, and fallen trees and under concrete bridges. One group clung to underside of a large leaf of South American traveler’s palm { Phenakospermum guyannense , Strelitziaceae ). The Chestnut Sac-winged Bat emits search-phase echolocation calls in triplet pulses, with each subsequent sound pulse 2-3 kHz higher than the preceding pulse. First pulse has mean frequency of 25-4 kHz that rises to 28-7 kHz and 32-1 kHz on second and third pulses, respectively. Mean durations of these pulses are 5—10 milliseconds, and mean pulse intervals are 84-102 milliseconds. Chestnut Sac-winged Bats use search calls with components that are dominated by narrowband and small FM parts. These characteristics are well suited for detection of flying insects from relatively long-range detection distances, and similarly used by other members of the tribe Diclidurini .

Flight emergence begins a little before sunset, and individuals fly above canopies and forage with long, straight sallies and rapid dives to chase aerial insects. Early flight above relatively low, open canopies of deciduous forests can easily be observed. Calls with principle energy in second harmonic, start with 42- kHz narrowband component that drops slightly by 1-1-5 kHz at 39-kHz broadband. Mean call duration is 12 milliseconds. Terminal drop in frequency over a broadband facilitates targeting approaches to flying insects, and relatively long call duration is indicative of foraging in open areas rather than close to vegetation.

Echolocation search calls consist of pulse sequences, with first harmonic peaking at frequencies of 39-2-41 • 1 kHz. These calls have narrow bandwidth and short durations (1-4-3 milliseconds). Search calls allow targeting of aerial prey from relatively long distances.	Ball (2004), Bambini eta/.

Classified as Least Concern on TheIUCNRed List. The Yellowbellied Sheath-tailed Bat has a large distribution, uses a variety of habitats, presumably has large and stable overall population, occurs in protected areas, and feces no significant threats. In northern Australia, acoustic surveys using full-spectrum detectors that record harmonic profiles suggest that it is relatively common. The species has reported incidences of viral Australian bat Lyssavirus that can be transmitted to humans. Feral European honeybees {Apis melliferd) commonly take over tree hollows in arid Australia and displace Yellow-bellied Sheath-tailed Bats. clearing and replacement of perennial tree species in arid areas have reduced area of occupancy.	The Yellow-bellied Sheath-tailed Bat is insectivorous and includes beeties and moths in its diet. It typically uses a fast, direct flight while foraging for aerial insects above eucalypt forests but will fly close to the ground in open areas. Echolocation search calls are audible to humans and emitted via the mouth.			The Yellow-bellied Sheath-tailed Bat is crepuscular. It roosts in tree hollows and emerges at dusk to forage; it will temporarily shelter in buildings along migration routes. In Australia, the species often uses abandoned nests of Sugar Gliders (Petaurus breviceps) as roosts. Multiharmonic echolocation calls are of long duration. Harmonic with greatest intensity starts at c.20 kHz and slightly sweeps down to c.18 kHz. Characteristic frequencies are 17-5-22-5 kHz. Search phase is usually curved but can be flat. Harmonics are often 28-33 kHz and less commonly 9-13 kHz. Occasional non-harmonic pulses within a sequence have characteristic frequency as low as 15 kHz or as high as 24 kHz.

Movements, Home range and Social organization. Most roosting groups ofCoastal Sheathtail Bats consist of less than ten individuals, but larger groups exceeding 100 individuals have been noted, particularly in older published accounts. In winter, Coastal Sheath-tailed Bats can cluster in groups of up to five individuals, but in wanner months, they maintain individual distances of up to 20 cm while roosting. Even in large caves, they roost in well-lit areas and remain alert and quickly take flight if approached too closely, moving to another roosting site or deeper into inaccessible parts of large caves. They can commute up to 15 km from roosts to nightly foraging areas. They have been observed flying between offshore island roosts to the mainland ofAustralia to forage. At the extreme southern end of its distribution near Rockhampton, Australia, they deposit fat in autumn and thereafter enter short bouts of torpor during coldest times of the year. Torpid individuals have cold body temperatures that require up to ten minutes or more ofwarming before they can fly. Status and Conservation . Classified as Near Threatened on The IUCNRed List. Nevertheless, the Coastal Sheath-tailed Bat almost qualified as Vulnerable in the most recent evaluation on The IUCNRed Listixcmse it is highly probable that less than 10,000 mature individuals exist, some recent population declines have been observed, and habitat loss might cause future declines. In Australia, it is potentially threatened by loss of foraging habitat from sand mining and coastal development and disturbance at roosting sites. It is protected in Cape Hillsborough National Park and several other coastal and offshore island protected areas in Australia. Recommended conservation actions include protection of key roosting sites and foraging habitat Additional field studies also are needed to better assess its distribution, abundance, ecology, and threats in Australia and Papua New Guinea.

Its diet includes flies, beetles, moths, and even butterflies that are active in late afternoon. Foraging habitats shift seasonally when Greater Sac-winged Bats cue on variation in insect phenology and abundance. They forage alone; individuals usually move from one feeding area to another after c.25-30 minutes.	From C Mexico (Jalisco and Veracruz) S throughout both Pacific and Atlantic slopes of Central America to Colombia, E to E & SE Brazil (S to Rio de Janeiro State), and S to Ecuador, E Peru, W Brazil, and N & NE Bolivia; also on Trinidad and Tobago Is.	https://zenodo.org/record/3747999/files/figure.png	Greater Sac-winged Bats are crepuscular and can be seen in foraging areas in late afternoon, well before sunset, within shaded forest understories. This primary foraging activity occurs for c .3 hours into the night. A secondary foraging period occurs in early morning, and individuals return to day roosts soon after dawn. Mean flight speed is 5-8 m/s. Roost shelters include dimly lit cave entrances, trees hollows, boles and between plank buttresses, buildings, window screens of inhabited buildings, and undersides of bridges. The Greater Sac-winged Bat capably maintains appreciable temperature differentials with its environment . It usually remains normothermic and is alert and active in daytime roosts. It maintains a resting rate of metabolism that is high compared with small insectivorous bats in other families. It is likely that its diet of small, abundant insects provides enough energy year-round to permit a roosting strategy of alertness and vigilance in dimly lit shelters potentially vulnerable to predators. By maintaining individual distances from roost mates, groups of Greater Sac-winged Bats are able to simultaneously fly as an escape response, which would not be possible for bats that cluster tighdy because individuals on outer edges of a cluster must fly off first and those in the center of a cluster must wait for critical seconds before taking flight. Search-phase echolocation pulses of Greater Sac-winged Bats are relatively long (5-6 milliseconds) and paired. They are characterized by slight rise in frequency at onset of pulse, followed by a long F part, and terminated with slight decrease in frequency. Maximum energy in prey searching echolocation calls varies with geography at 42-50 kHz from populations in Belize, Costa Rica, and Panama. During approach or pursuit phase, calls become shorter, with more pronounced rise in frequency than in search phase. Terminal stage emissions, or feeding buzzes, are even shorter ( c .1-1.7 milliseconds), with less pronounced rise in frequency.	Barclay (1983), Behr & von Helversen (2004), Behr et al.

In Panama, Thomas’s Shaggy Bat occurs in ridge top cloud forest up to elevations of 1450 m.	Thomas’s Shaggy Bat is insectivorous. It forages while flying back and forth along a route, with slow, deliberate, fluttering flight, and often along natural and man-made pathways. It preys on aerial insects in moderately cluttered to open forest habitats within understories and over flowing creeks. Based on direct observations, it forages 2-5-5 m aboveground. Most identifiable stomach remains in a female from a swamp forest in lowland Costa Rica contained planthoppers (Fulgoroidea, Homop tera) but also at least two different beetles ( Coleoptera ), one of which was probably a leaf-beetle ( Chrysomelidae ), and parts tentatively identified as orthopteran. No scales or other evidence of lepidopterans were present. Based on generalized behavior of these prey, Thomas’s Shaggy Bat might feed by gleaning insects from surfaces ofleaves and branches, taking slow-flying insects on the wing, or using a combination of these two strategies.

Riparian and tropical rainforests and human-disturbed areas such as plantations, clearings, and villages from sea level to elevations of c.1700 m. In Brazil, the Northern Ghost Bat occurs in Amazonian wet forests and Atlantic Dry Forest, the latter biome being highly fragmented. Northern Ghost Bats are insectivorous, and moths are favored in their diets. They forage for aerial insects high above forest canopies and large clearings and over water. Visual observations suggest foraging can occur up to 135 m aboveground. Breeding . In Mexico, copulations occur in January-February, and pregnancy and lactation take place through June. Females produce one young that remains with them at least through August. Non-pregnant adult females have been observed in December-February, suggesting they are monoestrous. Activity patterns. Northern Ghost Bats are crepuscular. Palms are used as day roosts including coconut palms ( Cocos nucifera ). On the Pacific slope of Mexico , Northern Ghost Bats roost in native palm Orbignya cohune , and in eastern Mexico Astrocaryum mexicana (all Arecaceae ).

For most of the year, Northern Ghost Bats are solitary except for females with dependent young. Small, temporary groups of a male and up to three adult females occur during breeding season. Individuals in a breeding group roost 5—10 cm from each other. In Jalisco, Mexico, Northern Ghost Bats are present only from late October to May, suggesting some populations are migratory.

Palms are used as day roosts including coconut palms ( Cocos nucifera ). On the Pacific slope of Mexico , Northern Ghost Bats roost in native palm Orbignya cohune , and in eastern Mexico Astrocaryum mexicana (all Arecaceae ). They roost near rachis ofa palm frond 2-25 m aboveground, with their white coloration making them very cryptic when viewed from below against sunlight. They emit low-frequency echolocation calls, with very long pulse durations.	Ceballos & Medellin (1988), erreira et al. (2013), Hood & Gardner (2008), Kalko (1995a), Lim, B.K. et al.

It tolerates second growth disturbed by humans and forages near buildings and in oil palm plantations and gardens. The Short-eared Bat preys on aerial insects. Breeding . A pregnant Short-eared Bat was reported in dry season in Tocantins State, Brazil. In Costa Rica, females with nursing young and subadults are reported in June- August. Activity patterns. Short-eared Bats are nocturnal and roost beneath fronds in palm trees including coconut and oil palms, usually in relatively open areas such as groves or gardens. Roost emergence starts c.45 minutes after sunset. Foraging usually is restricted to immediately around day roosts for 15—30 minutes, after which individuals disperse further from roosts while flying at least 3-4 m aboveground. Echolocation call is unusual among emballonurids: FM call remains above 100 kHz and is short in duration. Movements, Home range and Social organization. Short-eared Bats roost in groups of 1—10 individuals. They hang freely by their feet when roosting, near midribs of fronds. Roosting groups can contain adult males and females, subadults, and dependent young. There is evidence that roosting group composition is not stable even over short periods of time, with different individuals moving into a group.

Gray Whales frequent continental shelf waters along both sides of the North Pacific Ocean, including East China Sea, Yellow Sea, Sea of Okhotsk, Bering Sea, and Chukchi, Beaufort, and East Siberian seas in the Arctic Ocean. Gray Whales are highly migratory. When migrating, they may cross deep ocean and follow undersea mountain ranges and escarpments. In summer, they feed on the bottom of shallow continental shelves in high latitudes. In fall and spring, the western population of Gray Whalesis believed to migrate along the Pacific coast of the Far East from Russia to China. The larger eastern population migrates along the edge of the continental shelf of the Pacific coast of North America from Alaska to Mexico. In winter, Gray Whales congregate in coastal bays and lagoons that afford them protection from predation and warmer water for rearing young and mating. Their habit of frequenting relatively shallow continental shelf waters and coastal areas for feeding, migrating, and breeding is unique among mysticete whales. While capable of navigating deep ocean areas, Gray Whales migrate to and from their summer feeding and winter breeding areas along distinct corridors that follow within a few kilometers of the North American coast (for the eastern Gray Whale) and the eastern Asian coast (for some of the western Gray Whales). They disperse widely across the Arctic and polar seas during summer feeding, and they aggregate in shallow coastal areas, embayments and lagoons in subtropical latitudes for breeding and to give birth.	Primary summer feeding grounds of Gray Whales include the Gulf of Alaska, Bering Sea, Chukchi Sea, Beaufort Sea, East Siberian Sea, and Sea of Okhotsk, and they also exploit prey resources where they are found throughout their migratory distribution. They forage for patchy concentrations of prey found on relatively shallow (50 m or less) continental shelf areas that correspond with areas of high primary productivity supporting extensive benthic invertebrate communities. Gray Whales use suction feeding to exploit prey from the sea floor, but they can also feed on swimming prey by gulping and skimming prey from near the sea floor and ocean surface. Principal prey includes infaunal, tube-dwelling ampeliscid amphipods, polychaete worms, bivalves, swarming cumaceans, mysids, shrimps, krill, mobile amphipods, and shoals of clupeoid fish such as sardines and anchovies. An adult Gray Whale may consume ¢.220,800 kg of food at a rate of ¢.1200 kg/day for c.180 feeding days. Gray Whales do not feed extensively, or at all, during fall and spring migrations or while in their winter breeding areas. Fasting whales may lose up to 30% of their body fat during winter. This is especially critical for lactating females that are not feeding while nursing and caring for their offspring. Water is obtained from their food and metabolically from body fat. Warming of the Arctic Ocean due to global climate change and subsequent reduction in permanent sea ice has accelerated in recent decades and has affected distributions and availabilities of traditional prey communities. Some historical feeding areas of Gray Whales have declined in size, but it is possible that new prey communities will become established in other areas where oceanic and ice conditions are favorable. Gray Whales are responding by foraging over broader areas and staying longer in their summer feeding areas to obtain sufficient food and energy stores for winter migration and breeding. Flexibility in feeding modes and prey selection of the Gray Whale has allowed it to survive over many Pleistocene glacial and interglacial periods in the geologic past. Its abilities to use alternative prey and feeding areas are advantages for dealing with climate-driven oceanographic changes. Although switching prey has the advantage of providing additional feeding options, it may also create competition with other marine species that exploit the same resources.	N Pacific, from the Arctic Ocean and Bering8 Sea to Baja Y California, the Gulf of California, and portions of the mainland coast of Mexico in the E, and to the coasts of Russia, Japan, Korea, and SE China in the W. Extinct in the N Atlantic Ocean.	https://zenodo.org/record/6599171/files/figure.png	Gray Whales migrate continuously day and night at 6-7 km/h, pausing only to catnap, forage, or mate. On average, swimming Gray Whales will surface every b—7 minutes between long dives and take 3-5 breaths at 15-30second intervals before submerging to resume swimming. Before beginning a long dive and after a sequence of breaths, tail flukes are frequently raised above the water’s surface. Aerial behaviors include “breaching” (jumping out of the water), “spy hopping” (raising head vertically out of the water), “tail stands” (holding flukes and tailstock vertically above water’s surface), and “lobtailing” (slapping water’s surface with flukes). Gray Whales forage continuously on their Arctic feeding grounds during long periods of daylight characteristic of these high-latitude areas in summer. During the winter breeding season, courting Gray Whales are continuously active, rarely resting at the water’s surface. In contrast, females that are nursing newborns move about breeding lagoons with their offspring and frequently rest or “sleep” at the surface while their offspring continue to swim around them and nurse. Young appear to be active at all times, never resting or sleeping.	Alter et al. (2007), Andrews (1914), Barnes & McLeod (1984), Bisconti (2008, 2010), Bisconti & Varola (2006), Brownell et al.

The Greater Bulldog Bat roosts in hollowtrees, although some have been reportedin caves and rock crevices and occasionally human structures such as bridges.	Greater Bulldog Bats are adaptedto feed on fish that they capture directly from the watersurface. Fresh andsaltwaterfish dominate diets, but insects are also eaten, sometimes copiously. In adequate conditions, it is quite a spectacle to watch small groups of Greater Bulldog Bats raking the water surface with their claws over and over. One study showed that as much as 80% of the diet can be insects. Other prey included shrimp, crabs, and scorpions. Greater Bulldog Bats have large cheek pouches that they use to store partially chewed prey; they forage until cheek pouches are full and then finely chew and swallow prey items. When foraging over water, they use three forms offishing: high search flight, low search flight, and random rake. In high search flight, they emit long (13-3-17 milliseconds) pulses and fly 20-50 cm above the water surface, point-dipping their hindclaws when a food item is detected. In low search flight, they emit shorter pulses (c.5:6 milliseconds) and fly only 2-4 cm above the water and also point-dip their hindclaws when prey is detected. During random rake, they echolocate as during high search flight but dip their hindclaws in the water for up to 10 m . Random rake is mostly used in the presence of copious jumping fish, and they can catch a fish every 50-200 passes.			Greater Bulldog Bats are nocturnal, generally leaving the roost within two hours after sunset. In Puerto Rico between November and January, they left the roost within an hour after sunset, but in August, they left an hour later with no apparent reason for the change. Most activity occurs before midnight. On cold nights with temperatures below 12°C, they did not leave the roost. Groups of bats seem to leave the roost together but do not return together. When female members of the same group left the roost, they lingered in its vicinity until other members of the group exited the roost, and then they all flew together toward foraging areas, within 5 m of each other.

Lesser Bulldog Bats usually roost in hollow trees but can also be found in buildings. They often share roosts with other species of bats such as mastiff bats ( Molossus sp. ). In the Beni Department of Bolivia , Lesser Bulldog Bats commute among forest islands across tropical grasslands and use hollow trees of at least eleven species; roosting trees have greater diameters than non-roosting trees.	Diet of the Lesser Bulldog Bat is strongly dominated by insects, primarily hemipterans, beetles, moths, homopterans, and dipterans. According to all published studies, Lesser Bulldog Bats feed copiously on insects, but other studies also show that they eatfruits of species of Moraceae ( Ficus , Brosimum , and Morus ) and Urticaceae ( Cecropia ) and occasionally fish. Pollen of various tree species has also been reported in stomach contents or fecal pellets. Given that they often fly in open areas, they are believed to be good seed dispersers. One study found many remains of dytiscid beetles, a primarily aquatic species, in the diet, and a pimelodid catfish swallowed a Lesser Bulldog Bat, both suggesting association with aquatic environments. Lesser Bulldog Bats have been observed scooping insect prey from the water surface. Observations in the wild show that they fly in open areas including along slow-flowing streams and rivers, lakes, and estuaries, briefly dipping or dragging their feet or interfemoral membrane in the water to scoop up insects. They spend an average of ¢.120 minutes outside of the roost, most of that time foraging.			Lesser Bulldog Bats leave their roost quite early, right after sunset, in contrast with their larger congener, the Greater Bulldog Bat that leaves the roost up to two hours after sunset. This difference has been suggested to be a mechanism to avoid competition between congeners. Lesser Bulldog Bats stay active usually between sunset and 1-2 hours after sunset and then return to their roost, with a second peak of activity around midnight.
