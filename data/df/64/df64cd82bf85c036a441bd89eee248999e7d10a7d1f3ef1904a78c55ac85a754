And, a uuid (without prefix) is a valid uri. The main reason for adding the uuid is to have something unique to reference an abstract concept. Sort of like a content hash uri for things that have no content. \r\n\r\n> The introduction of the arbitrary uid for 'the abstract notion of a graph' is a bit ... abstract?  Could you illustrate this with an example of some other object that also prov#hasVersion but isn't as abstract?\r\n\r\nAn example of a similar abstraction might be [```owl:Thing```](http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#) (aka http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing , see https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-guide/) . However, I didn't want to commit to owning a domain name until the end of time (e.g., http://preston.guoda.bio/#biodiversity-graph), so I minted a uuid instead. The abstract uuid is given meaning by the things it relates to. For instance, the  [pav:hasVersion](http://pav-ontology.github.io/pav/index.html#http://purl.org/pav/hasVersion) relationship with a content has uri. Note that the definition of [pav:hasVersion](http://pav-ontology.github.io/pav/index.html#http://purl.org/pav/hasVersion) explicitly allows for abstract resources: ```[...] This property is intended for relating a non-versioned or abstract resource to several versioned resources, e.g. snapshots.

From what I understood from Weiss et al piece I have a much better sense of where the \"6\" comes from in a hexastore, but in less it was supposed to be obvious they didn't really explain doing so with content hashes the way your write-up illustrates so nicely.  If there's no prior art on this, have you considered writing up the hash-based hexastore approach by itself?  \r\n\r\nI'm still wrapping my head around the mechanics, but it sounds like it could be a nice alternative to the existing RDF query systems we have available, at least from R without resorting to java plugins (i.e. redland bindings, which scale poorly in performance and lack bulk import of triples).
